the one that um deals eh your your uncle's ah
santaclause is our personal toy run
we took we went like we went like two hundred bikes
nosotros

right
yeah we took a truck full of toys
because what happens is is that that that main toy run which is the south florida president's council is what it's called they um um it's a bunch of ah clubs that are associated
and then what happens is is uh everybody goes and donates a toy
apart from donating a toy everybody pays um you pay ten dollars per person to ride in the toy run
and this year after they paid everything they they uh they they got all the money that they grossed out after they paid all the debts that they had to pay we donated to joe dimaggio i think was uh five hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars
plus we donated about twenty thousand toys
so but that was that that's the biggest toy run
that one's the one we leave from uh pampano pampano beach
and we ride
they close i ninety five and five ninety five
they close it
and and the bikes will go all the way from pampano all the way through i nine ninety five five ninety five all the way to markham park
the line and there's people already on both ends and the line's still riding through that's how many bikes go
and they close everything
they have uh police come from all over the the counties
and they they close it off
they close off completely uh i ninety five only motorcycle travel
and that's through
we had a lot of fun
we were there parking bikes from what was it seven or eight in the morning
until until like ah two o'clock
bikes parking bikes from that time in the morning
and then we parked them
and then once that we parked all the bikes then we
had to leave
yeah well we were the last ones because we were we there were we were the first ones in and were the last ones out
well it was about they estimated forty thousand bikes
that's a lot of bikes
i never seen so many
it's a lot of fun
we have a lot of fun
i don't like
eh she's always complaining que
tú siempre quieres estar en el club
no quieres ir a ningún lugar más

every time we go
we go on fridays
ella se pone se pone mala toda la noche
on and friday night they get you get to eat una completa
so you're complete for six dollars
con muchas las veces con dessert
te compras a a a bottled water
yeah that's what she likes
that's her favourite part making coffee
yeah yeah
we go there every friday
and
and then they have karaoke
they have karaoke
se ponen en um the uh attorney del club
i guess he's not the attorney
but he's an attorney
so they use him for for stuff in the club
he um he has a an i pod with eighty gigs of music
ok so he's got
llenito
all video de de for karaoke and and all kinds of songs
and all he does is uh he hooks it up to the t v
and then uh and the and when we get there sometimes he'll just put music just different kinds of music
and then after ten we put the volume up on the on the ah the system del club
because a lot of people complain
ah you can't have the loud music the whole time because we don't all come for that
well that's fine
so then they we made an agreement que from seven to until uh ten o'clock it's the music's down low
then at ten we shoot up the music
and then she starts dancing con las las mujeres del club
and there's about
six or seven
they're always there bailando
and they're having a good time
yeah
y después entonces he starts putting karaoke music
and a lot of the people there's a few of them that drink two or three beers and they get drunk or they get buzzed out
and you see everybody
singing to the songs you know
but we have a real good time
la otra noche nos fuimos we've had nights when we've left like at one one thirty in the morning
yeah
it's it
mira we did we just went to
no that was when we did the valentine's party
la la
la fiesta del the
we ended at twelve
and then well we got home like at four in the morning
because we went to el versailles
ah right over there on main street
right back to thirty seven in front of la carreta
that's where todos los cubanos y esto hang out
i wonder if
es es la ocho
la después de que tú pasas la treinta y siente en la ocho
está la carreta on your on on the south side
y y versaille está to the
that's right
después de que tú pasas todo eso
está por ahí
and they um
y fuimos para allá
we i think fuimos como veinticinco para allá
y you know porque en el grupo siempre there's those who who are very active
and then there's a lot who just go to hang out
and they leave
they don't really stay
yeah we have a club house
we have a warehouse that we rent
and then um
i'll show you pictures when we're done with the motor mouthing here
and halloween party
yeah uh you should see you should see how los viejos esos like liliana
liliana is is
they call her nana
they call her nana
yeah they don't even call her liliana
they call her nana
she's ella llega allí
sí ese ron
she's unreal
he's seventy one seventy one years old
and he looks good
yeah
sí el el gaucho
sí ahora después que todas las cosas um i gotta pay off some things que nos quedan ahora
de ella la niña
once i get those things squared up boy i see see uh if we uh
but she'll ride with us
she'll ride with us
oye allí allí para que tú
you're not that you're not that well balanced
you have to be
how do i say
you have to be cut out for that
because a lot of people cuando montan la la the motorcycles they believe that a motorcycle just by turning the wheel the motorcycle turns
and you're going fast
it doesn't work that
no it doesn't work like that
when you wanna turn you have to actually with your body turn the motorcycle because it doesn't it actually wants to keep going straight
so you know you turn the wheel
yes you do
but if you could actually turn
the um the
the bike actually you have to actually lean into the way you wanna go
you have to push your body weight so the bike will go into the curves
and now there's one old guy que he drove off the side of an expressway because we were coming up on the curve
y parece que le cogió miedo la curva
and he didn't lean into it
se quedó recto on the bike
and and what happens is is you do one of those like you know te va echando por un lado así like you're gonna fall off
because you're afraid the bike's not gonna turn
and he just went off the side of the road
yeah that was before nos hicimos miembros nosotros
or actually it was just about three weeks before nos hicimos miembros del club
yeah he broke he broke three ribs
yeah
y el el problema que tiene que la cogió miedo a la moto
ahora está
no pero you can't
if you're gonna ride it you you can't be afraid of it
because
no you'll the the biggest problem why people
no she she she rides behind me
she actually doesn't need to grab on to me because my bike it has a a a backrest for her
yeah she's learning
yeah she's not like when we first started
yeah she would like you know when you get on the curve and if i'm going really fast you have to really lean in to it you know
but you don't fall because it's all centrifical force
so you you know you're actually leaning the bike pero you know
yeah
and alyssa she's gotten used to it
yeah ella se
she she's getting she's
and we have a good time
we went to también a saint augustine
we went a big group
yeah
yeah
liliana followed us in her car con ana
locas
fíjate que they gave them an honorary uh diploma
a a a ella y a ana
les regalaron un honorary diploma
del club for attending in the trip
e iban las dos locas through the sunroof taking pictures
yeah but we have
it's a lot of fun
there's you know right now in the club there's a lot of controversy
because there's a lot of people
yeah there's people that race the bikes when we go through twenty seven
no they ride at close to a hundred and sixty miles an hour
no
we've been on our bike like we've we've gone up to about a hundred
once you get used to cruising at seventy five eighty you actually when you go slower it feels like nothing
actually last weekend yo estaba haciendo signal para sacarle pie para to show that there was a dead otter in the middle of the road
and i took out my foot
and you're supposed to actually you know if there's something on the road or some kind of an obstacle since everybody's riding together if you're in front the guys in back can't really see when they're coming up to it
so what you're supposed to do is you're something on the road on your side you're supposed to put out your foot
and to show you know
you're not supposed to lay
but apparently i calculated wrong
and i left my foot down too far
and i hit that damn otter
i almost broke my leg
i almost broke my leg
we're doing almost seventy miles an hour imagínate
something laying there and then you kick it
it was like
that los los viejos they were all cracking up because uh when we came back it was still there
and he goes eh you know
seguro que ese es la nutria
in spanish es una nutria
seguro que la nutria ese dice
coño me arrollaron y me mataron
y ahora viene con una patata a mí
coño hasta donde voy él
and it was pretty big too
no mi amor
it was about like this
huge sucker
yeah
tú
well let me tell you
it didn't feel
jesus that thing hurt
no we have we have such a good time
everybody there's there's people in our age group
and there's people that are older than us
but the good thing is is we also have the radio on the on the thing so we're listening to everybody talking on the c bs
so you these guys are all they got this one guy
this guy's a joke
he comes up he comes up with these things that you know you wouldn't have dreamed
but then te da el you know just cracking up all day
you gotta be pissing every ten minutes because he just cracks you up with the things he comes up with you know
todo locura de esa de loco
but you gotta
no he's gotta be he's gotta be in his fifties
él no puede estar más que eso
the same
you think
no no no much older
no más está en los cincuenta
yeah
no maría está en los cincuenta y pico
no maría no es tan tan
she's not no spring chicken
she's ya está
lo que pasa es que es una cuando fue jovencita tiene que haber sido bien bonita
poca
sí
sí
and they love to dress up
whenever we have a hallowe'en party
se ponen peluca para saint patrick
fue con peluca verde
en en una fiesta que hicieron de de disfraz she went dressed like saint polly girl
para halloween i'll show you the pictures
ricky fue like the angel and a devil
yeah together
yes well what it was was like um like when it was the type of costume like when people get into a horse
and then the you're the feet of the horse
and you're in the horse but you're also riding the horse
that's what type of it
it was a mix between
a half part of him was the devil and the other part was the the the angel
pero he was walking around riéndose
and and we had such a good time
oh
look who's home
we're we were talking shit about you
has what
pero we
todo está allí
todo está allí
y el
y ahora y ahora they wanna do um
i think they wanna do a ride up to tennessee or something
oh yeah
you coulda ridden
you coulda ridden
there was space
there was people that that went out
and unos señores que fueron solos
es como todo
bueno tú primero te montas like we didn't know any one in the club
when we went we were just fresh into the club
what my dad
my dad's been in the club already four years
my dad my dad went into the club when i bought him his harley
i actually took him
because uh i asked the the people at the dealer
and they told me
no go see these people
and we went there
and i took him
and you know when he first went in the first it was like
you know
pero empezaron a coger presión en eso en en
and he's uh he likes it
we have we have issues in the club que they have to be worked out
pero i'm pretty sure everybody has issues you know
yeah
and they they have they have a lot of people
the typical type problems
que yeah there's people that don't want to pay their membership
or and then the membership in this place is is junk money
and we have a club house
and they're paying um
what do you call it
i think it's eight dollars a month is what it comes out to
that's nothing
and then there's people that complain that that's too much money
and i'm like you know
give me a break
you know that's that's not a lot of money
and you have a place to go to
it's every there every friday
después como
no they do
there's a lot of there's a lot of uh like we went to calle ocho this weekend
and i believe we sold like six thousand five hundred dollars worth of beer
in calle ocho
yeah
right now i believe active active active members i'd say there's about a hundred and forty that are active all the time going there
there's actually um i imagine i'm member six hundred and something
yeah six eighty four
but what happens is is that a lot of the older people some have stopped going some don't go
and those are some of the issues
because what happens is these people get lost
and then they come back
and they don't pay membership for a couple of years
and then they come back
and they wanna pay their one year
and then like if
my dad was complaining
he said
no i don't think they should do that
i say
if you want your original number you have to pay back everything that you haven't been paying if you wanna keep your number
or not we kill your number
and you get a new number like the last person
pero they they you know the president of the club no tú sabes he's real político
he's a good person a very good person
pero igual lo que pasó we had a camping trip
when we went camping
and um
she didn't wanna go
we had a good time
they took karaoke
they took the karaoke
everybody took their tents
and um one guy which
wasn't a member of the club paid
uh hadn't gone to the club for like three years
and then showed up
because he wanted to go to the camping
he heard about it
and um uh the president told him
you can't go
you're not an active member
then he goes
well if i pay can i go
well he says
yeah if you pay your membership you can go
he paid his his membership
and uh he showed up in a camper
and his camper got stuck in the back all the way in the back of the of the thing
it got stuck uh because it's humid over there
and it got stuck in the ground
and i and the presidente had to wait for him all day until they took his out with una grúa
and i said you know
and then he was complaining
because he pulled out a big uh one of those big screen type t vs one of the projection types
and he was watching a movie
and imagine we had tremenda música con esta tocando
and everybody was singing and dancing
and we were laughing jokes
and he was complaining that the music was too loud
and i said
look
you don't make the rules
we are the ones that planned on doing all of this
if you don't agree with us that's fine then you can leave
but you how you gonna be not even an active active member and then you gonna come and complain
y entonces he was talking all kinda ah junk
and i and i him
you know i don't really appreciate that
i don't think we should allow people like that
we don't need people like that
y este de verdad que tipo se ve que es un pesado de madre
you know
the other day he showed up at the club on friday
and uh he asked for water
and they gave him a bottle of water
give me a dollar
he goes
oh you gotta pay for the water
what do you think
you know this isn't this isn't a not for profit organization
yeah you gotta pay for your stuff here like everybody else does
oh i didn't think that was right
give me a break man
what do you think
you gonna pay around a hundred dollars a year
and you're gonna think you're gonna get free food every friday here
what's wrong with you
what do you think
that costs money
yeah the food is six dollars
you get your um whatever it is arroz un plato lleno de comida
six bucks it's you can't beat it
sometimes they have chicken wings
sometimes they have french fries hamburgers
it depends what
sometimes people from the members will bring food
they'll donate the food for that friday

pero iria quiere iria me me pidió que los filees en su
no mentira
habían dos que tenían problemas
verdad
so yo le dije yo le dije
selena estos dos tienen problemas
and i didn't even write on the post it the problem
iria wrote it with her handwriting
and it was simple
it was a simple simple problem
it was um one of them was to call the nurse and verify that there was a sharp container in the house
and the other one was um to call the nurse and verify that it was that his her son was still the house the caregiver care giver or something like that
very simple
yeah that you could do it in five minutes
i understood what selena was telling me
but that's not my problem because i'm just telling her what iria is telling me to do
so whatever selena esto eran como diez pacientes
and out of them all those ten two of them had problems
y le dije
selena estos dos pacientes tienen problemas
este el póster está ahí mismo explicándote el problema para que tú lo puedas hacer
entonces ella me mira
and she goes
eh y por qué
yo no entiendo por qué la persona que revisó esto no no lo hizo de una vez
no llamó a la al que resolvió el problema
and she goes
yo no entiendo por qué la persona que tenía este que tenía este eh que que revisó esto no me ayudó no lo revisó no lo hizo
no no arregló el problema
and then it's funny because i should have just been like bueno hizo eso y no le da la gana de de de revisar eso porque ya te está pagando a ti un salario y quiere que tú tú eres el case manager y quiere que el case manager lo revise
yeah like because it's true
i mean yo le revisé
like if iria is telling you
exactly because there's a reason that they are the case managers so they could resolver los problemas
and not only that
like if she says she doesn't feel like doing it she doesn't feel like doing it
she is paying selena a a salary of a case manager so she could solve those problems
so the reason she's the case manager for the patient
so ella yo la miró
y yo le dije
no sé selena
porque the thing is with selena i've already learned to just have patience with her
i'm not gonna bitch at her
i'm not gonna talk back to her
i'm not gonna talk back to her
and i'm not gonna bitch at her because there's just no point
so i go to her um
i looked at her
yo le dije
no sé eh no sé selena esto me lo dio
all these mosquitoes
esto me lo dio esto me lo dio iria
y ella ella me lo pasó para ti
entonces ella lo cogió
like she got it from my hand
and she goes
she put it to the side completely to the side
and she goes
bueno i'm not gonna stop when
bueno i'm not gonna stop what i'm doing right now to solve this
so this is gonna be this is gonna be later on whenever i have a chance
y yo le dije
no no no sin apuro selena
tú haz eso mañana por la mañana when you want when you when you when you are más calmada whenever you want
yeah
and then i gave her the other eight patients
and then i go to her
and then she goes
mal trabajo
no no no no no pero yo no entiendo
and i'm like
like i looked at her
and i'm like
selena si tú quieres se lo das a pedro
you know her assistant
and i was like
se lo puede dar a pedro
y que él te lo filee
and then she just turned around
and she goes
here pedro véame esto
y él dijo y él dijo
entonces le dijo así selena
yo te lo hago ahora
or i'll do it for you first thing in the morning
you know to put it to the side
so it was funny because that's the way selena reacted
but then i went to clara
clara had her own stack
and clara had one patient with one problem
and i go up to her
and i'm like
clara um estos eran los pacientes tuyos
y éste éste de adelante tiene algún problema
and she is like
a ver ya lo leyó
she goes
ah ok eso es facilito
like she handled it with such patience
the thing is
i think she saw me
she saw the situation with selena
she saw how selena had reacted to it
so i think clara is being smart in the sense of like i'm not gonna be a bitch
i'm not gonna talk bad
i'm i'm not gonna handle
i'm not gonna look
or like i'm gonna handle the job with ease
do you get me
so she looks at me
and she goes
hay uno solamente
qué bueno qué bueno qué bueno
and she like clapped her hand
and then she goes
qué bueno qué bueno
and i just laughed
and she was like
yeah bueno
um and here is the other
and y entonces estos estos otros no tienen problemas
pero iria quiere que tú lo filees en los
and she goes
ok mamita
i'll do it right now
it's no problem
and then like today i had given her
because i terminé de revisar like two more patients
i finished reviewing two more patients
and i gave her the rest
oh my god people keep calling my cell phone
hold on
pamela i'm in school
bye
so then um
no
no i i don't know
she she picked up the phone
and she goes
you have to call me
and i was like
let me ask if it was an emergency
entonces um she she handled it completely fine
and then i gave her a
i gave her some things to do today to clara
and she said
sí mamita dame a mi todo dame a mí todo lo que tiene que ver con mis pacientes que yo prefiero tenerlos en el
y yo y yo tenerlo aquí todo
like clara handled everything so perfectly and smooth
abigail is it an emergency
then what happened
bueno
problemas
y estoy ahogada
pero if he is the case
pero she is the case manager for those patients
she is the case manager for those patients
that's what she has her salary for
that's what she's getting paid for so she needs to do her job
just because she gets atareada just a little bit too much
she like she does oh a little bit more work than than normal
she already like she gets at she is i don't know she's she's learned to not be as rude
but she's pretty rude
yeah she's very rude
did you see what happened today in the morning

oh he never called me patty
or patty was sleeping in his house
she was sleeping
regardless i think he was home
i don't think so
she's not gonna sleep over there but
regardless she was home
i think so
um
so are you gonna start classes next semester
in fall
and your foot is gonna be recovered
do you have enough time to get to have your foot recovered
i mean recovered
and is that is that even recovered yet
is that a
that's not that i think i used
or well your foot be
healed
thank you
january february march april may
june july
and then august
the same you are gonna be walking with kind of
yeah you'll be you'll be fine
no
january
yeah
yeah that's the same thing
you are gonna have june and july to
plus school doesn't start like the first week of august
i have a little bit of august
yeah you have a little bit of august
to be able to completely
i know
but i think you should off for the high heels
entonces um
possibly yeah
yeah that could just be any
about
exactly if we are gonna take all four classes it'll cost about a thousand and
i think it was six hundred more or less
ok it's a hundred dollars per credit
a hundred dollars per credit
and then each class is more or less worth three credits
like english is worth three credits
and math is worth three credits
do you get me
but um like let's say that semester that i took it the the freshmans arrived or whatever
that wasn't worth
that was only worth one credit
do you get me
so let's say you are taking four classes
um so four times three each one being three credits that's twelve credits
times about a hundred that's about a hundred a thousand two hundred más o menos
and then you have to then pay all the fees
the parking fee the fee
yeah
and then it comes out to like i guess a little less like a thousand five hundred or something
um wow
wow that's good
it's good
the f i u
yeah
that's not good
um
but i was gonna tell you the the thing here er ok
miami dade is setenta dólares por crédito right
yeah and here it's just a hundred
so it's about thirty
times twelve how much is that
i don't know i just came straight over here
finish
it is saving money
just came straight over here
carlos was here and
i like the school
he he guided me through it
no you get the hang of it
ah you see miami dade seems too confusing to me
not confusing
but it's seemed like a jail to me
yeah
because it's just the buildings
the buildings are too like gray
this is this is just this is a small class though to be honest
english classes are put in a really small class
most of our
all my other classes i ever had even my math class which is right in this building but towards the other end they're all big classes like auditorium like
even if it's just for a hundred students
but they're the type that you walk in
and they have like steps
you get me
that you go up and then
that's how all my classes are
the only classes that have been really small always have been my english classes
all the other ones are like those types
i just don't like how the building looks
f i u have a lot of arts
and like the buildings look prettier and like
but it gives you more environment
oh it's one of those
yeah it's building four
and then you just find the room inside
yeah
yeah exactly
acelerada
parking
no parking is very very difficult
extremely difficult honestly
you have to be here about
like i'm really used to this
i really know like i just go into the garage
and i go to the fifth floor because there's always gonna be parking there
but it's pretty difficult
and takes before like freshman freshman year but the first semester i ever took here i never had such a hard time parking
but that's because i wasn't like
and i would get there way early
like i'll be at school like an hour half an hour before my class
and it's just like i didn't know to early
just don't bother looking for parking right
fifth floor
can use the elevator
no
and then the buildings here there're just
they's not by numbers
but they're by names
they're like this this building here is the chemistry and physics
but when you when you've
yeah
yeah
cause they're using it as an english class you know
this is obviously a lot of other things
mhmm
mhmm
ok
that was a very good experience
why had it what is the next the next trip that we did

porque vivimos las dos solas
nos tocó vivir solas a las dos y nos
y era sabes vamos sabes inventábamos así como mi mamá habla
but it was tough
the the first year i wanted to to go back to venezuela you know
i didn't like it at all
the first year was really hard
like i've i've seen here it's hard to make friends
it's hard to like to have good friends that you can you know
it's like these people that work with you and that's about it
when you go to school these people may leave
these people that are here you're not gonna see them you know
so it's like you know you go to their houses you go to
i don't know their names
i don't know where they work
no ya estaba yo misma así oh my god
sí igual mi esposo me decía hay que ir al cine el viernes y yo tú sabes que los viernes son muertos

claro
sí sí
ay dios
pero gente que a lo mejor que si son ricos por fama o porque es una celebridad ese
eso no sabes a lo mejor fueron si fueron ricos se hicieron ricos de la noche a la mañana
pero yo también yo admito que yo que trabajé en un retail store me yo hasta ya me lloraba así de mal de que los clientes lo mal que te tratan
o sea no es cualquiera que vaya a comprar
son gente muy que ya va sabe lo que quiere no te molesta mucho no sé qué
pero también está el cliente que te que la las tiendas cierran a las nueve y la media de la noche
y entran a las nueve y veinticinco te desarmaban toda la tienda y
y entonces se se ponían bravos porque tu les dices que las tiendas ya se van a cerrar
entonces siempre se armaron que les estás botando que no sé qué
o sea gente que te armaban un lío y de paso no compraban nada y
pero sí
y estaba con su esposa y yo le digo
bueno quiere que le yo le si es lo que ya lleva varios si yo se lo puedo tener
y ahí no hacemos comisión así no hay no es que sabe que era venta mía y yo me iba a pelear
no yo le digo para qué si el hombre pudiera caminar por la tienda más fácil
y él
no no
la mujer le pone una cara así él
no no tranquilo
él se ponía todo nervioso entonces
al rato lo veo con más cosas y le digo
no se preocupe
téngalas aquí que en cualquier cosa si quiere cambiar es para que hacerle la más más confortable
y la mujer me
claro todo esto en inglés
la mujer me ha empezado a decir las miles groserías en español
ella pensó que yo era gringa que yo era una americana
y entonces
esta idiota que no sé qué que por qué no se va que no esta así
y yo entonces y le le hablo en español enseguida le dije
no tranquila no se preocupe
que le tenga todo lo que tenga allí y yo no hay problema
y por la misma se fue la mujer casi que se quería morir
porque me dijo todas las groserías que creo que se conocía del
o sea sí
pero claro estoy diciendo fastidiosa
pero me una cantidad de groserías
y al hombre le dio una pena
y ella después le dijo al al manager le dijo
ah no que ella nos estaba atendiendo para que me diera la venta
no aquí no se trabaja es por horas sabes por
no no la gente yo te digo
y te hacen pasar la pena frente de quien sea tú te quedas así oh trágame tierra
cada vez que salimos cada vez que oye el tremendo tip el tremendo o sea porque uno dice dios mío esta gente
o sea déjala que esté con su mal humor
porque tú no sabes quién fue el que vino antes de ti para decirle una cosa
a lo mejor le habrán insultado
le habrán dicho de todo
y la pobre una reacción
o sea no vas a estar todo el tiempo sabes
o sea yo pienso que uno está de mal humor y que es porque no le gusta su trabajo algo así
sino que tú no sabes que pasó antes de que tú llegaras
o te pasó algo uno no sabes
o sea que esa de juzgar o sea
pero bueno si si no te gustó tu trabajo olvídate si no te gusta ya sabes
y uno en seguida ya eho eh juzgar rápido a la gente
entonces yo digo la veo de mal humor y uno tratando de
hacerle tú sabes más bien hacerle una gracia hacerle algún comentario para que el se para que el día no le sale tan horroroso no porque
y le tocó una vez trabajar para direct t v
pero a veces salir diplomático no sale
sí
bueno yo comparandole muchas cosas de ésas no sé mucho
son groseros son groseros
la etiqueta la
pero lo exagerarlo tampoco
uh there's g c up top p c on the left side book store on the top side as well
it's i mean this is pretty readable right
this isn't some kind of disgusting explanation
this is a map of parking garage
now the next one
um the next one after that
i'm gonna ask you if you were standing there
were you standing at point one
yes i was standing at point one when the police found us so and so on
during the incident o k uh when we were found were you standing at point one on the third floor
that's where we were standing
it's imperative that we make that clear because the next page
on the next page you'll see it
um it's imperative you say it because on the next page then he's got an option
where were you standing you know right before you came up
and i've got pictures for each and every one of those
um except for location two
i have location nine
but if it's location two it'll be beautiful because i'll be it will say the building
what what did you see
what did you hear
why didn't you check over there
i mean
i would have to say oficial right
i mean that sounds
you wouldn't say policía because that's that's
make it sound better
actually you don't want to tell someone you know in fascist argentina
you know like that's
oficial
like that's
it's like
boggle my mind laughs
that was delicious
that was amazing
um i have a bruise on my shoulder right now from the rifle that i shot
you ever seen the movie enemy at the gates
red like from here to here
dave shot it one time
and then he's got this black and blue bruise laughs
but when you're talking about guns it's recoil
and that that was nothing
that was nothing compared to that first rifle that was nothing
yeah
i mean i'm sure you know this
but do you know how they marketed the kalashnikov
um the first time they marketed it they said i can clear a soccer field with four hundred men like that are that four hundred men with ten of mine
give me ten kalashnikovs and ten men and i will clear a football field with four hundred people
they asked
four seconds
you know you never
and it's because i heard someone shoot an a k full auto thirty rounds
it took about four seconds
the entire magazine gone
it was like one two three four done
it was a whole magazine
they've now wasted thirty rounds of ammunition
it probably cost them twenty dollars in four seconds in four or five seconds
um that's that's why they use three round
and the three round burst is pretty fast
it's
but at least with three round you hit in the same place
this was the spray you know
this was the area i was hitting
it's not an accurate gun at all
the other rifle on the other hand is
the only problem is after you shoot it once you don't want to shoot it again
so the the first time you shoot you hit dead on the mark
but the next time you shoot you kind of like anticipate
and you start getting nervous like right right
this is what's so funny
i'm holding it
and i can see my breath moving the end of the gun little by little
and i know it's gonna hurt me
and then you see my rifle start doing this
pretty funny
it's an experience man
you should come
david'seng rifle
it's a twenty two
it sounds like
it's
um
it it might take an hour
just get all write down all the questions all of them everything we can come up with
and then we have two hours to kind of practice
i mean he can he can lie the first time or
tell the truth the second time
are you gonna turn off your thing
you're talking about the uh the jitters you get when you go up there
she just goes
what's her name samantha
she she goes up to samantha
and she's like
no he's i'll take him
like what
and then when we sat down she she started telling me some stuff
she seemed ok
and then i started asking questions asking questions
and she
and then give me an answer
and then
can i keep going
and then i'd ask another question
she'd give me an answer
it's really weird
she would also use that face to dodge me
so she kind of like her face gets stone cold when she's trying to dodge people
don't make it too public
but just do something when i'm getting agressive
because i know that when i question people maybe the first fifteen minutes is good but i i i do feel like i'm hunting them down when i get the answer i want
i mean just look at this guy
you know that's actually something i like about spanish
um it really combines a lot of words
it's not um of the
it's just del
that's right
just de el
slam them together del
some of the time because when you take accents and stuff into play those acentos can be pretty
because english does allow you to be a little ambiguous which means you can have so many more double meanings at times
and makes it interesting
little things like that really lengthen an article
you don't know how many times i'm like like the professor of france french professor
i i see it having like a like a
and you being a man of efficiency will obviously not tell her if there's no point
hey you never told me what happened with that
get over there
i'm gonna start numbering them now
but don't you love this picture
don't you love this picture
what do you see
and what's interesting i i will ask what did you see
and i i took these two pictures very quickly
i i took these quickly enough so that i could ask him to describe what he sees through that window
so he's like
i see a light
there might be a car
there's another car
could you tell me the colour of the car
could you tell me which way the car is going
could you tell me if it's the front or the back of the car
tell me all these descriptions
and i'll be like
well this is what it actually looked like
and these are the things you did not include
so if you say that you saw us throwing something that's that's funny
there coulda been a man standing right out there
you couldn't see him so
that's anyway
yeah we should start numbering them
um if you don't mind helping me
i brought a pen
let me figure out
so i we can just tell from the photo where each one is
so
put the map upside down
i'm just gonna
i'm just gonna put these close to each other kind of like if i'm putting a map on paper
um this one's closer
that's what we're gonna do
sorry what did you say
so unlike you
vacilar
la estoy vacilando
i mean
that's one thing
so there isn't that um that authoritative
that sticks
what brought this up at
that's that's the best euphemism i've ever heard
yeah the verb
i wonder if there's some
i mean you would know this better than i would if there's something in history something that happened that somehow brought those two words together if it was fun to inspect
what was when was it fun to check out
why
it makes you see things differently
make you see your shapes differently
if you take the right professor um this guy ted mackenzie
not that you would ever take his class
but if you audit it or
she brought the
actually i said the same thing
you brought it up the same way
you're like
you met her
um well let's see
help me out here
this is uh thing
this is three right
i'm looking at it upside down
the three
this is close enough to be three
this would have to be four
this would have to be this would have to be four as well
this is kind of the general area
um
ok this is definitely a three
ok
hold on
trying to think
trying to remember like my dad shouting at my mom when i was like six years old
me estoy volviendo calvo
coño
laughs
no hairline
about hairline
um
yeah
didn't we talk about this at dunkin donuts
and i was like
i don't know
but i know about the entrances
and you were like
yeah yeah las entradas
um yeah
i have no idea how to say hairline
is there a spanish dictionary over here
look it up
i wonder where the word calvo comes from
there's gotta be some base term
so this is three
and we'll say this is
this is kind of the same area as three
this would have to be four
and then i'm gonna be like
so where were you standing in these two
do you remember what it looked like
because this is what it looked like from that direction
i was standing in three but a little bit more to the right
ok well here you go
what did chuck nerris say
it goes right back on my piano when you're done
sat down at the piano yesterday
i'm gonna play
hey where the is my poetry book
i don't know if you've noticed this
it doesn't have creases
because if i find i'm on a certain page and i find them in a certain condition i leave it as it is so
why
i'm pretty sure we can have uh two pictures for every area so he can't say you know
it was a little bit north of that
you know
we can't
this is seven
um this is going to be seven as well
nope
so the goat escaped through a a bigger hole in my in my fence right
and mind you my grandfather used to walk that goat every morning around the neighborhood like like if it was like if it was a a dog
so our next door neighbor had a dog right
and whenever the the neighbor would let the dog out
and he was like putting his work stuff away
and then so in when the dog
he closed the door
and he left for work
he didn't see the goat go in
so my grandfather wakes up like at ten
and he is looking for the goat frantic
and he's screaming around the neighborhood
tete tete where are you
like that like frantic
so somehow some way he looks inside of the neighbor's house
and there's the goat with the dog running around eating all the furniture pooping everywhere
we had to call our neighbors
we had to help them clean everything
we had to help them do all the furniture
it was just oh god
tete where are you
ay
so do you have a funny story
oh yeah yeah
my family's just crazy
oh my mom has a patch on her eye
i told you
she used to have contacts
mind you the contacts are
the contacts are purely for show
like for color
she had colored contacts on
i mean she doesn't have perfect vision
but they they have no prescription on it
and so she she scratched her cornea really bad to the point that they had to do surgery
this was like ten years ago
so whatever she had like stitches and all that stuff
and apparently my mom's my mom my mom has really bad allergies
and she loves to like scratch her eye
you understand what i mean
so she um she actually ended up scratching opening up stitches that she had from super long time ago that i guess never healed right
so now you have to look at her
she looks like a pirate
she has a patch
on one eye
you know what i mean
and like she's walking around
and she wants you to like feel bad for her
because she's like
i don't feel good
but i was like tell her
um like yesterday
that's what i was about to tell you
almí'seng a almí'seng a snitch
yesterday he he wanted to use my computer
but like i get really moody
like when i get home and like i'm tired
and like i just all i wanna do is be on my computer
like whether i'm playing snood or on facebook or like googling random stuff
so
so he comes in
and he's like
they love to like use my computer
mind you we have another computer in the house
but my computer is the only one that's hooked up to a printer
so he's like
oh i gotta print something out
he doesn't have to print out anything
he wants to go check sports net like
you know what i mean
like it's a fantasy football
and so whatever i locked the door so that he can't come in my room
because he loves to come in there
and then he he's like snitching on me
he's like
mom she won't let me use the computer
and i have to do something for school
so there comes my mom with her patch on her eye
feel bad for them oh oh pobrecito
who my mom
no my mom kind of forgets they exist
they're always at my grandma's house
yeah they don't live with us so
yeah they're always at abuela's house
yeah
like they don't really like my house
no
me my mom larry which is my step dad larry'seng brother who came from cuba with his girlfriend who
his mistress who she's had for thirteen years
yeah
no this is a true story
this isn't even
this is like new people
this is like new people that i didn't even know existed
this is one of like larry'seng
remember i told you larry has like five brothers
this is one of his five brothers
with his mistress
he left his wife and his two kids in cuba
and they're both living at my house
and then on top of everything larry'seng dad is living at my house
because he just got separated from his girlfriend
here in cuba like here here in miami who who when he came from cuba he started hanging out with this lady
then her son came from cuba
and then he's the one who's forming problems between larry'seng and the girlfriend
so larry'seng dad got fed up and moved out
but now he's not even home half the time
because he's still with her
but now they're in a dating stage
you know what i mean
they have they're they're in a dating
they're getting to know each other
and then that's how it is
it's ridiculous
oh my house is
i have three
which is my mom's that was split down the middle because it used to be two
mine
and then like the garage which is like a big room
but they like they remade everything
oh yeah no no no
my brothers don't sleep in the same room because they can't stand each other breathing
they both breathe too loud
that's what they say
they breathe too loud
so we have one brother who sleeps in there
oh and they don't even have furniture
because we since we redid that entire room we were gonna redo furniture
like give them furniture
so then but then now they decided to put back up the wall in my mom's room so one of them can have that one
and the other one can have the other one
and then i have another room that larry has like his work stuff in there
and then
like whatever
so we didn't never get them finished thinking that we were gonna put up a wall
but we never put up the wall
so now oliver sleeps on a mattress in the in the garage
sleeps on a mattress in my mom's room with my mom and larry
ana and lexi sleep on another mattress in in like where the t v room
and paco which is larry'seng dad sleeps on a
on a cot
on a cot outside like in the sala
not outside laughs
like outside in like the formal sala you know that like it's only for show laughs
like you're not allowed to sit in it laughs
you know what i'm talking about laughs
yeah
it's like furniture that like it's like fifty years old
nobody can sit on it
yes laughs
full of like oil
full of aceite
oh my god my mom loves
my mom fries stuff and then she puts it in the oven
like she doesn't let the
she doesn't even let the the the the oil like
cool
she just puts it in the oven
no and
no but not only that you also have pans in like the the pans like what you cook on in there
so you have to take out like twenty things
and then finally get the one you want
and then after you have to wait for everything to cool or if you're gonna be able to put everything back in again
i have that
and at my grandma's house too
it's very cuban
no that's like do you cook with mazola
people use like olive oil
no no no
we use mazola
oh yeah the it it's um chicken broth
yeah it's like a it's like a little cube
yeah little
it's a good flavor
like chicken flavor
my mom loves it
um she always tells me
los cubitos de pollo
but it's chicken broth
and how's everything with your mom
she's good
how's your mom
how's your brother
bratty
what school does he go to
oh
how come he didn't go to like columbus
he didn't like
you go to church
every sunday
ahah
um have you been back to lourdes
we went once
and we were running amuck
we even went to um walgreens
and got like masks
and it was right around hallowe'en so we were like running around like scaring the crap out of people
i was in a blues brothers mask
oh
the sumo wrestlers
did you see darla'seng pictures
it's like intense sumo wrestling
it's like it's like a full harness
like they even have the little hat with the bun
i don't know
like it was like no it's like a game
like you go somewhere
and you hit each other
i don't know
i don't know
look at it
look at her um
oh my god that girl's so funny
kind of bitter about it
no
um
i know i know you don't like talking about it
but you know who i always talk to now
sara
like obviously she's like number one
like like super excited
and she's coming this weekend
she um called me up
not called me up
she messaged me
she's like
hey whatever i wanna come down
i wanna see you
she wants to she wants me to go um to like amanda harding'seng house
mind you i don't even think amanda harding likes her
yeah i think she hates us
but no i think that she hates us by association
but i'm sure sara'seng told her like
oh no like whatever
yeah she's the one that was with
yeah
but you know who's really nice
ana
and her sister anita
who sara
oh yeah
she is
she is
wait but didn't she get a new job
i know she got a new job
she got reassigned somewhere
oh yeah
you do you talk to her still
oh yeah
did you hear about the eye story
yeah laughs
um but
here's the thing
i at the end of the day i think she has a she has some of a heart
ok because she's done a lot of messed up things like the whole thing with brenda paltro
that she
yeah that's what i'm saying
sara realized that she had messed up the next day
because she was belligerent
so she realized that she had messed up the next day
called her up
and said like
sorry look
you know what i mean
i was messed up
whatever i said things i didn't mean or whatever
and once you talk about it it's ok
like the whole thing with katrina
did you hear what she said about katrina
did she
wait
did you hear what she said to katrina
ok katrina poked her on facebook
which was immature
that's not her business
because she's stupid
just because you know to
yeah to mess around
it's childish
and um sara wrote her back this nasty message
this really
you know sara
ok when you mess with sara she goes after you your family anybody you've ever been with
and like anybody
so you know what she told her
she told her
she's like flat out
she's like
look
she's like
i don't care to be your friend
i don't know why you know what i mean you consider you know what i mean you try messing with me
and when i talked to her after she told me that a lot of it had to do with the reason why she was so angry is because when you guys were in a fight katrina got involved
did she ever get involved
something that katrina got involved with you with a like a situation between you guys
and then you know what she writes at the end of the message
she goes
i hope that your father is looking down on you
like because her dad's dead
and yeah
and then like whatever
like everybody was outraged that she had said such a thing
oh like a long time ago
when we were younger
no
i don't think so
i don't know katrina'seng life
and then um
and then she talked about that
so all this stuff
and then everybody was like
oh what is that
she has no heart
all this stuff
and like when i talked to sara about it
because i talk to sara about everything flat out like the vacuum cleaner story in the apartment the turning on and off of the chime the comment about lesbians
like all that stuff i talk to her about
and she she was telling me that the whole thing with katrina is she felt bad after having said something
but she knew that if she hadn't said something so powerful katrina would have probably written back to that comment
and then it woulda just started this whole thing
she's like
i wanted to say something to her that she knew i meant business
and that i want nothing to do with her
you understand what i mean
we're super we're super immature
yo bro
she is
oh you know how many times she's cheated on
oh no here's the thing
when i found out ok
ok to f s u
when i found out that she had left to tallahassee without telling her mom anything and all this stuff
and it had just happened that thing with my mom
so when i went to tallahassee i look at her
and i'm like
sara you can't do that
because at the end of the day that's your mom
and i guess like something clicked in her head
you know what i mean
that's the thing
that's the reason why me and sara
ana's always like
i don't understand how you're friends with her
all this stuff
the girl's shady
she's done a whole bunch of shady things
yeah but the one person that i can talk to
like obviously i have veronica
and i have vanessa and stuff
but like ana and them they judge me all the time
you know what i mean
maybe not to my face
but they do
and vanessa i think to an extent judge me too
because we're different
you know what i mean
but me and veronica are very similar
you know what i mean
yeah hers is just her dad
and mines is my mom
so what happens is that sara'seng that type of person that i can go to sara
and i can tell her anything
you know what i mean
and i know she's not gonna judge me
why
because she's done pretty messed up things in her life
and she's had a pretty messed up family too
so it's not
you know what i mean
it's not like
she yeah she she's no one to judge me
and on top of everything when i tell her
i can i can talk to veronia as much as i can
and try to tell her things about my mom
but at the end of the day she has a mom who's great
you know what i mean
who's there for her
and all that stuff
so
yeah
with veronica it's different
because at the end of the day i have the dad
and she doesn't have the dad
do you understand what i mean
but with sara it's um it's the it's the same issue
it's the moms
although her mom maybe more crazy than mine
you know what i mean
to a certain extent
because my mom's crazy
more crazy in a certain point
and her mom is more crazy
and another point
so that's why
you know what i mean
i talk to her
so when i talked to her about that whole thing i think it kinda clicked in her head
and her and her mom were good for a
you know what i mean
after the tallahassee her mom even took her up
and stayed there
i'm not i'm not sure how their relationship is right now
when i go see her i think i'm gonna do it
yeah
oh after that whole thing with robert
and that he got arrested because of um violence with
remember that day we called her
with the new wife
there was like a whole issue
yeah
there was a whole issue or whatever
and then i think i think that
what do what do what do you mean you get
like
oh
i know but
oh so you read it
all separate
oh so your your your
yeah so
it's just retarded
oh my god
yeah
yeah you shoulda been the one mad at her
yeah
wow
oh i heard of that
i heard that
oh i remember that
that was huge controversy
yeah
anywhere near your house
derek'seng house
that's like how i feel with
yeah
oh yeah
laugh about it
that's like how i feel about
yeah
yeah why'd you do it
she was a good friend at one point in time
yeah for like a few months
and you felt bad for her
you know what i mean
you thought whatever
who are you talking to
is there anybody there
oh
it's like my it's like my sister says
i forgive
but i never forget
so you can forgive sara
but you never forget everything that happened
look look at this ring
it turned my finger blue
like it's it looks like my tattoo
but i like it so much
wait
you know why we call
you know you know why we call bonnie guite right
it's making fun of you guys
yes because you guys talk like little muffin like
it's bonnie
and so then like we love to have you
yeah so so whatever
we always thought it was super funny how you guys called her guite
but her name has nothing to do with guite
so then bonnie who really is guite we just started calling her guite
and then like it stuck
i mean at the beginning it was like to make fun
but now just like i like it
like i like her
whenever she calls me i'm like
guite
no no no you smell like
you smell like that pot i put in my oven
ay used to live in the corner
en la esquina
like senior skit the other day
we were watching senior skit
what
do you put pots in the oven
yeah laughs
yeah
everything
yeah like cuidado con el aceite
susana
susana
no no no no no
ok sara had told me that she didn't know if she was gonna stay in tallahassee because her parents her grandparents were paying for it
but they couldn't pay for it
because sara doesn't have bright future
she doesn't have
she yeah first robert was paying for it
i think robert did it out of spite
for everything
i think robert did it out of spite
and then
she had to
she had told me that um
that her grandparents weren't gonna pay for it any more
and she was gonna have to figure out what to do
but from what i heard she's already planning to move in with all these people or whatever
why would she be planning a move if
you know what i mean
i don't know
maybe maybe finally she
maybe she's
or maybe maybe she's she's maybe her like cathy
cathy like breeds out of her butt
maybe what she told cathy was
oh i'll move in into your room
you know what i mean
and like we'll just share a room
but you pay for the rent or whatever
yeah either way she always stays with derek
i she she had originally said she was taking out loan
but i don't believe she ever took out loan
do you know what i mean
first of all if if if you're taking out loans in your undergraduate
if you're taking out loans in your undergraduate there's a problem
you know what i mean
because that that's
oh
no
now she says
now she says she wants to be in now she says she wants to be a cop
because we were talking when me and her we started talking about the whole and the whole controversy and the rooms and all that stuff
do her friends what
no no
no that's just
here's the thing
when that when that was issued when that was given to them like that nickname by lucy was given to them then they took it to a whole another level
here's the thing
if you get called something and you know it's not true and you think it's so funny that that person even thought about it
i don't drop it
i don't drop it
oh i don't know about that
according to her no
i don't know
i don't know
i mean whether lucy said it
lucy said it because
i mean there was something there
like that they kissed or whatever whatever
that's what i'm telling you
the pictures now attribute to the fact that lucy said what she said
they're just taking the joke to a whole another level
that's what happened with the whole dyke thing
and
that's what i kept telling sara
i'm like
just drop it already
she's like
yeah that's what i kept telling her
but whatever
oh well the whole cop thing
she was telling me that
and you know that sara'seng very
she was telling me that she feels like breaking face in
you know what i mean
but the reason why she doesn't do it is because she already has a a a violence on her record
that's one
and two
yeah that she already has violence on her record
and two she doesn't want that you know what i mean any more because the violence from before was from what we were sophomores
so that's like expunged the minute you you turn eighteen
you know what i mean
yeah it's expunged
so whatever
you know what i mean
and like now she says that she wants to go in to in to like the police force and whatever
and she wants to do it
i think i think you have to you have to
you have to you have to major in like i think maybe that maybe maybe like you should major in like law studies
or something like that
or like criminal justice
and then later on you become
t c c is two years
it's a community college
i mean you could be in a community college for four years
but it's your first sixty credits
you don't need college
yeah
she goes right now to t c c if she even goes to school
i don't really know sara's academic career
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i'm gonna i'll talk to her about it
see what she wants to do or whatever
oh she coulda been an an excellent runner
they coulda had a full
right
but
she just said it
ten points
i told her
you know how many times i told her about
and at this time her grandparents had custody of her
which means she woulda had to have put her grandparents' information
they're two retired people
ok
that get paid off of like medicare or whatever
you know what i mean
social security
so you know how much money she woulda gotten
her grandparents must make like what twenty thousand
she threw everything away
but i i told her
cathy got into f s u because of me
ok
because
yeah
listen
she got she got in for free because of me
the care program
ok
because we were sitting in art class
cathy cathy had no thought of even going to tallahassee
ok
and and i was talking to my who was great ok
who she knew since the minute my sister left that school that that's where i wanted to go
you know what i mean
miss thomas who was great
she would call esther everyday
you know what i mean
and then she told me
look there's a loophole
your grades aren't that well
which mind you i brought up my grades senior year like ridiculous
i graduated with a three point eight from lourdes
you know what i mean
why
because i was just lazy
if i put my mind to it i can do it
because i'm not stupid
i just i'm lazy
and so what happened was that she she had told me about the care system whatever and all this stuff
and it was if your parents made under a certain amount of money
um mine's happened because my mom was divorced
whatever it was all the money issue
and you know how like cathy isn't that well off
and like her parents have they have a business but like
but like yeah
but like it's like going down
and whatever all this stuff
like lucy was always talking to us about how her parents were helping out with cathy and all that stuff
and i told her about it
and she's like
oh ok i'm gonna go ask my counselor
because her counselor didn't care
you know what i mean
like if if she didn't get in
yeah
she and then so she went to her counselor
she got that thing
she wrote the great essay
all this stuff
she got in
yeah but cathy and lucy haven't been friends for a long time
the thing is is that if when you have a friendship so for such a long time lucy was always the dominant one
and cathy was always the one that just followed along whatever lucy said
and so what happened was that that lucy would kind of like not mistreat cathy but she would kinda like take cathy for granted
you know what i mean
and like tell her things
and then and what happened was then cathy became close to esther who is more or less like her
because esther is a very is a very is a person who follows
she she you know what i mean
you tell her what to do and she does it
so they became friends
and then when lucy saw that esther and cathy were getting close together she
oh she had her phase
i remember
oh yeah
i remember
when we went on retreat
when we went on retreat
first of all she treated mark like crap
ok because i remember distinctly a game a game
yeah
a game here
i'll tell you right now story
i remember a story distinctly a game here at at um f i u columbus versus something that she was screaming at mark like if mark was her kid
screaming at him
telling him all these things like
people thought she was crazy
like all the all
lucy i mean esther bonnie and tiffany were ready to drop that friendship
ok
so the point
oh
then we went then we went on encounter
ok
on encounter went i went on encounter junior year in hopes of becoming a
and senior year i could be um like i could be one of the talks
wait

she says
you know i'm here to do my orientation
i said
well i'm sorry but the office is closed

well clare said
so call her right now
i said
you know clare doesn't do orientations
but i can call my office right now
so i picked up the phone
and magdalena
i said
magdalena i have someone who she's finished closing
and they told her to cross the street and that you would do an orientation
magdalena says
no i'm closed
i can't do an orientation
i was told not to do any overtime
so i proceeded to hang up the phone
and i said
i'm so sorry
tut the office is closed
there's not much i can do
and she just got all wired up
and she's like
call clare call clare
and as she does this her boyfriend sees how or her friend i don't know if boyfriend or friend
no
what for
she was calling her on her cellphone
and you know i picked up the phone
i gave her the number
and she's verified the number that she had
and i said
yeah that's that's the number
so i hang up my phone and let her call her
she her boyfriend said
well let's just go across the street
so they went across the street
and got clare
clare was well clare was clare
walks all you know huffing and puffing
sí laugh
sí se parece un patito volando
pero bueno
sí sí
pero no
entonces ella
al principio cuando ella entró me dice
which one
oh o k
hey wait a second
let me finish my story
because i haven't told you what happened
o k so this whole story right
and then this morning she came
well yeah because we didn't do the orientation yesterday
and um she made a complaint against me
so karen calls me
and she says
um i have a resident who just made a complaint about you
and i said
well karen um that's why i came into the office this morning at ten thirty to tell you i needed to speak to you
she's like
oh is it on the report
i said
it sure is
it's on the report today and yesterday
she says
well we need to extend more courtesy
i said
hold on one second
did you see how excited she is
did you know how upset she was yesterday
because they kept her four hours just sitting there waiting for clare
she's like
oh you're right
o k well
she's like
o k you yeah i think you o k you did fine
and that was it
but yeah karen was at first you know just dumping it on me
and i was like um this woman
i wasn't gonna stay
i don't do orientation
i was like
yeah but no
it wasn't my place to call karen
it would already
no no i did
i gave i gave her the office card
and she didn't want it
she wanted clare
so she went and got clare
end of story
but then this morning she was complaining about me
and i was like
it's not my office
i don't do orientation
she's like
well i guess you because you didn't call clare
and i was like
why do i have to call clare
she had her on the cellphone
so anyways that was what happened today
so i was a little annoyed
but then i was like
ah i'll get over it
what's the worst thing that can happen to me
i'll just walk across the street
and ask the engineer there if they can give me a job
actually if they offer me twelve thirteen i will walk across the street
same shit
same shit different
that's true it's the same train
i can just hop on and hop off at the same time
on friday i have to go with you
at seven
at seven into work
why
because i'm covering for claudio
estaba de lo más emocionado
estaba feliz feliz
dice que eh le dieron ese internship
el internship
está como un intern
no le pagan
pero le dejan hacer le dejan estar ahí en el estudio
dice él que laugh que no you know él nunca ha hecho nada así
pero que tiene que entrar ver si todo está limpio que si algo falta que si esto aquello que llame que que él verifique
le ponen una secretaria
pero él está en el estudio que es donde él quiere estar
sí
yo no sabía que él estaba viviendo con su mamá
pues si el padrastro es la misma edad de él
cómo no va a estar fajado con ella
de quién del marido o del hijo
pero papi eso es
son dos son dos relaciones diferentes
claro
ah por eso se
es por que la luz
está bright
we can move over there if you want
you wanna move to the sofa
o k
oh well so the only reason i kind of figured it out was because she said
oh yeah claudio cooked
i'm like
how can claudio cook
claudio went home
and i'm thinking
oh claudio went home
home home
mommy's house
so anyways
ah jack i need you to call the people for the title
you need to tell them you paid ten dollars for them to do a title search
the lady says we'll call you don't call us
she could've just put those ten dollars in her pocket
o k ah i'm so glad she gave you a receipt
in that receipt's surely there is a telephone number
well could you find it please
i need to know what the hell is going on with that
did i show you how much i got paid
i didn't get paid as much as you
but i think this is not by much short four hours short
so last week you were four hours short
this week i'm four hours short
because remember that day of training
they only paid me for four hours
so that's gonna be eight
but it doesn't matter because that's what they pay
this is what this is what counts
this is what the number that we got to look at
seven eight nine
you think
alright
entonces le pongo aquí la cantidad entera
ninety five
and then here it is four four
and seven six
that would be nine
that's a two
so five and four
and four is nine carry the one
nine and four thirteen and that's four
oh my god
because i don't carry you carry
o k nine that's thirteen carry the one six seven eight nine
and that would be eight
and that would be
fourteen
o k so that's what we have right now
and upstairs i have about that much
and then there's another envelope with that
that would be nine
that's still eight
cinco seis siete ocho nueve
o k so that's what i have right now
what
i know but i'm always getting used to
just counting one two three four
i don't know
i'm slow with that
how do i know without actually counting that
makes no sense
o k so anyways
i'm i'm sure this can be rounded off but
in the i can round it off to two
just two period
o k forget that
i don't have to do that
o k listen
this is what i need right now
this is right
this is insurance
and this is car payment
that would be four and eleven right
don't laugh at me weirdo
now i still have no idea what the registration to your vehicle is
salud
you're so piggish
o k so
rent insurance car
so i still have
i know just give me a few minutes
como qué
sí
sí sí se puede
hoy con cash
si no es cash no
por qué
that's only because you want to eat at a restaurant
if i have to cook it's not so much
what do you wanna do
what would you like to eat
are you gonna find something en el carrito
that's because that's the first thing that comes to my mind every time somebody says something to eat i
o k
qué querías comer
ew
i'm not going with you
i don't like to eat hotdogs
oh no hasta my stomach was se puso así
de dónde
de dónde
el carrito tiene hotdogs

y cómo es que tú te comiste un hotdog si yo te traje almuerzo hoy
qué era una salchicha
wow
oye sabes qué tengo que decirle al valet que los hotdogs del carrito están más baratos y mejor seguro
que el hotdog del del seven eleven que ellos van y compran
uhhuh
hmm
y por eso también te cobran
sí
si te cobran por el hotdog
quiere decir que yo no tengo que comer pan cuando yo como hotdog
mira que bien
a mí no me gusta el pan cuando ew hotdog
me lo pones en un plato y ya
y yo me lo como
o k
hay carne en el salsita
like chilli
o k
esto pablito me estaba diciendo que a ella le gustaba
porque tenía te podías poner lo que
el plato de ella le costó dos dólares cincuenta centavos
eso es lo que ella dijo también
ella dice no
ay dios mío
entonces tengo esta cantidad
esa es la cantidad esa es mi cantidad para poner registración comida y lo demás
ya ves
que qué
cien pesos dónde
ese refrigerador no se llena con cien pesos
más
o k está bien
pero ahora ponte a pensar
no lo lleno
o k está bien
tú has visto el refrigerador ahora
nada
dos huevos creo que hay
pero es lo que te digo que
hemos estado apretando you know aquí apretando allá
te dije me me van a durar dos paychecks más dos dos pagos
van a estar aproximadamente aquí
este es el veintiocho tres veintiocho
la primera renta se paga este mes
éste es éste
y después aquí
esa es la primera renta
ahí es donde vamos a saber cómo estamos financially
ya
desde este momento al segundo que viene siendo veintiocho probablemente como el trece
déjame ver
alright
si me pagan el veintiocho entonces el próximo míralo aquí viene siendo el once
y me gustaría estar adelantada un poquito
entonces siete y siete son catorce verdad
entonces son mil cuatrocientos lo cual me quedan doscientos veinticinco como crédito
te acuerdas que ayer estábamos hablando de que si podemos
si puedo yo aunque sea quedarme sin pagar renta un mes por adelantarme así para que cuando los niños vengan yo puedo pagar para llevarlos a disneyworld un ratito
sí
no pero solamente por un día o dos días
no tengo tengo que quedarme una noche con ellos

say that i bring her the first week
it doesn't matter
if i bring her or him the first week hasta august
tengo junio julio y agosto si lo separo
esto es una semana
y una semana no importa en qué mes julio o agosto para el niño
creo que el niño se va a querer quedar más
she only comes for one week
that's what she told me
he's gonna want to stay longer
like three months
i don't know
he was talking about some stuff
um no they have the his dad is just
yeah
le escribió
una carta al niño rupert
suena muy frustrado de que si tú vives en mi casa gratis tú no estás haciendo estas cosas limpiar su cuarto hacer esto hacer aquello
entonces me dice
mami yo no estoy aquí gratis
yo voy trabajo
y el dinero que se agarra en esta casa
yo hago
ya el niño sabe
dice él
yo hago más
y traigo
y mira como él me dice a mí que cómo es que vivo aquí en esta casa gratis
después me dice
porque tú tienes teléfono
y entonces tú te lo pasas a en
y me dice
yo pago mi teléfono
el niño
entonces me dice
mami es que yo trato de ser positivo
y de no hacerle caso a mi papá
pero él dice cosas que es you know que me frustran
dice él
y yo no sé qué decir
y le digo
no le digas nada papá
tú tú eres menor de edad todavía
ahora
i know yo creo que él entiende esa parte
pero es de esos de que él él se siente como que lo está
he is letting him down his father
he is letting his father down
i think that's what frustrates him the most
so when i tell him
just just come and live with me
is like uh uh
he says
then my father is just gonna say i'm running away from my problem
which is true what he is gonna say
but
the moment is gonna come
but it's gonna be ugly
el niño no va a querer hablar con padre
él no va a querer saber del padre
no
no rupert never has wanted mucho así así tampoco
no creo
no sé
rupert rupert salió de la casa a las trece
trece años
paco viene trabajando para su padre por desde que tenía trece

le digo
no no no deja al niño en paz
me dice
no si yo trabajaba a los trece
mira el muchacho que tan grande está
ay papi pero es que yo no quiero que él sea

he could be besides failing because well he is failing in some of his classes
he
ok o k let's think about a normal family

y me lo dieron mal
y tengo que pedírselo a luisa que tiene ese servicio
porque pepe se brinda a llevarme
ya me ve se brindó a llevarme a ver a susana
pero es que te quedas a dormir te quedas
y me da vergüenza que más nunca la
una sola vez la he ido a ver
la mermelada de
billy me trajo una caja de mangos de que una amiga de ella se los dio para que yo hiciera la mermelada para ella
y la boté los otros días
pues tuvo más de un año en la nevera
pero hay que usar una de mango
los pongo en la batidora
los pelo
los hago pedazos
los pongo en el en el blender
con leche
pero hay que hacerlo en la batidora
y después colarlo
entonces después se le echa el azúcar
y cuando está espesito se pone en pomo
pero yo no pude ir a verla
y se me hicieron viejos en la nevera
los tuve que botar
mira como mira así eran de grandes
sí yo lo vi
pero óyeme la mata de mango esa que estaba muerta cuando yo la traje de tu casa
yo necesito sembrarla
tú no sabes sembrarla
y ya
y que hay que saber sembrar
la mata se siembra
según la raíz que tenga hay que abrir el hueco
entonces se le echa tierra buena
sí
no
calla
oh no
que te quede bien derechita
y se le echa más miracle grow por arriba
agua
primero cuanto en cuanto se hace el hueco primero es echar un poco de agua
después del miracle grow agua
y después le puedes echar cualquier tierra que no esté con vitaminas ni nada
pero no es
yo compré en nueva york catorce matas de strawberries por correo
esa rama va a
cae al piso
y enseguida es otra mata
strawberries
y le decía
mire váyase a trabajar
porque él solito solito en la imprenta
le decía
váyase a trabajar que cuando yo le tenga su
yo le ponía una bolsita
y se la daba a él
pero le encantaban
ave maría
y yo lo que me llevaba para arriba lo hacía almíbar para mamá
mamá le le gustaba
tú sabes
y le hacía como una
para hacer mermelada hay que echar un poquito de azúcar
y se las embarraba así
no mira así es como crecen pequeñas
ni dos pies no
pero cómo paren
pero fíjate aquí juan me desilusionó porque me dijo que aquí no
si uno no tiene la la tierra acondicionada así
si yo sé que tengo hormigas le echo cosas para las hormigas las compro
ustedes tienen hormigas allá
pero yo te digo las hormigas grandes las coloradas que tú
yo eso no lo puedo
veo una
y me me me erizo
hasta las sigo a ver dónde se meten
sí pero donde yo vivo
yo le digo
oye pero mátala
coge una escoba
y mátala
entonces no sabes lo que me dijo
que estaba en la cocina y que ella no podía usar la escoba
le digo
bueno pues usa cualquier cosa
cuando juan era un undercover cuando vivíamos en la ciento treinta y cuatro eh nos nos levantamos tu padre y yo
y vemos a juan durmiendo en un mattress en la sala en el piso de la sala
y le digo
juan
qué tú haces ahí muchacho
porque tú te haces
yo me asusté
me dice
no más porque mira yo no entro más a ese cuarto
yo no voy a entrar más en mi cuarto porque yo una cucaracha estaba caminando por mi cama
juan
tu hermano juan
o sea yo no me extrañé
sí ahora se ríe
aha pues mira sí
acuérdamelo
tú sabes que eh le digo yo me dice
mami
y no me entren en el mattress
no me entren tú y papá no
no me entren en el mattress por favor porque yo ya no voy a dormir más en ese cuarto hasta que tú no mates esa cucaracha
tito yo he buscado
yo he buscado
y no encuentro la cucaracha
imagínate
entonces le digo
tito yo no la encuentro
ya yo estoy aburrida de buscar
me dice
mira tú sabes lo que tú puedes hacer
te vas a ir vamos a ir a a la al rincón
donde le ellos ponían los las hojas secas y esas cosas
porque aquello era un cucarachero allá
ay sí verdad
yo cojo una
la mato
y la pongo para acá
y le dijo que la encontré
yo sabía que yo tenía que encontrar una encontrar la maldita cucaracha que él vio
no la vi
no no
eso fue de de
y bueno y enseguida que a él se le ocurrió eso fuimos
lo hicimos
y digo
ah bueno pues vámonos a traer el
imagínate tú en esa casa que se a cada rato entraba uno uno
no pues yo cogí
y le le pusimos el matress
le metí la cama de limpio y ya
mira fíjate mira él
ay él se puso de lo más contento laughs and claps hands
tú verás esta noche
oye porque y ahora él él tanto tanto que dice de ellen
ese día ella se me dio las quejas
me llamó para darme las quejas de él
sí porque ya estaba
pero yo le decía
oye coge una escoba
y mátala
entonces dice
sí pero es que no puedo coger la escoba porque está en la cocina
y yo no sé dónde se había metido la condenada
esas no son fáciles de matar no
qué barbaridad
no eh bueno pero billy es igual billy se pone en veta colorada
no pero allá eran las americanas las alemanas que le llamaban
y era por los vecinos de abajo
en cuanto se mudó aquella cojita se acabaron las cucarachas en mi casa y en todo el verde porque era el apartamento de la cojita y el apartamento de nosotros
se iban para abajo
ella fue la que tuvo la idea
me dice
luisita cuando usted lo
usted lo hace a las siete un día usted me avisa
y yo lo hago en mi casa
y así acabamos
y se acabaron
no habían ni en el hall se veía una así
pero tuvo que mudarse esa mujer para que yo no tuviera una
porque eran mal eran terribles para para terminarlas
horribles horribles
no yo ya gracias a dios hace diecisiete años que vivo ahí
y ya no se me van
ahora las grandes me pasan cuando llueve
allí
yo nunca las he visto por ahí
no de no de la cocina pero por el por el sink del baño
a dos personas les ha pasado eso
sí sí por el single baño
les le salió a un señor que le llamaban alberto
llamó a la oficina
y se la mataron
y total dicen que era de jardín
y por la bañadera le le le salió una
porque por eso fue que no me pudieron llevar en el helicóptero con pablo
porque yo tenía en trescientas quince mi presión
porque como perdí el el el conocimiento yo no supe nada
pero cuando yo vi todo el carro roto yo dije
ah no entonces fue un accidente
cuando vuelvo vengo para donde yo estaba sentado adelante con pablo veo que pablo no es no puede hablar ni ni ni podía abrir los ojos ni nada
pero por qué te empecé yo a decir esto
todo cuando yo me quejé y llorando le decía al al hombre del del rescue
usted dos de ustedes me dijeron que me iban a poner en el helicóptero con mi esposo
y yo no me quiero separar de mi esposo
me dicen
señora usted tiene la presión usted tiene tan alta la presión que no podíamos ponerla en eso
qué alta la tengo
porque yo no no no pensaba
pero ese día como estaba tan nerviosa yo no
y entonces me dice
usted tiene trescientas quince de presión señora
y ahí fue donde me di cuenta que ellos no me podían poner el
fue terrible
y el día primero de este mes cumplíamos nosotros dos años de casados
eso es una cosa muy ofensiva
tú no vas a comprar un ser humano
no
qué tú te crees
es un ser humano
ese hombre estaba delgadito mal atendido
toda la ropa lo mandaba al dry cleaner
por eso yo el día veinte de marzo que ella cumple años de ella hubiera cumplido años no
yo voy a ir al cementerio a llevarle flores como antes yo lo
eh siempre teníamos bien la tumba porque ella fue muy buena con él
ella le picaba hasta el bisté
pero ella le ella no ella le picaba el bisté
cuando tuvo el resultado me llamó
y me dijo lo que era
era cancer
y le el médico le dijo a pedro que era que es médico
ah que es el casado con la sobrina de de rosana
le dijo
si fuera mi abuela le daba dinero para que se fuera a viajar si le gusta viajar porque ella lo que le quedarán de de largo tres meses de vida
nunca les dan mucho más de tres meses
a ningún paciente de cancer
a ningún paciente de cancer
ay ese hombre que tú dices que tiene cancer ahora
el artista ese
ese no dura ni seis meses
eh el páncreas eh como que lo que los um
como que el cancer en el páncreas avanza más rápido
hace más daño que en otros órganos de la persona
y el hígado crece otra vez
no yo no creo que dure ni seis meses
él dice que le va bien el tratamiento pero
ojalá que viva muchos años más
eh la señora de de pablo no duró mucho
ella fue al médico
cuando llegó le dijo a él que lo que tenía ella le dijo a él que lo que tenía era cancer
y no duró ni cuatro ni cuatro meses duró
sí
y él se deshizo de todo porque tenía una compañía
ellos tenían dos de esos grandes para cortar hierba
y hicieron bastante dinero pero bueno
tú sabes que pablo tuvo siete casas propias
y el hijo se ha quedado con todo el dinero con la casa de
pero la de ya le había hecho un traspaso a la hija
unos criminales
valga que ni me han llamado por teléfono
a mí que no me molesten
porque no yo no quiero saber ya de esa gente
pero el dinero que tengo perdido en esa cuenta yo voy a ir a esa corte
aunque vaya sola
porque me dice juan que es un barrio muy malo que
que yo tenía que ir al civil court
y yo le dije
pero yo no sé dónde está el civil court
y me dijo
mire yo le voy a dar la dirección
y vino
entonces cuando juan me fue a llevar a casa fue a casa para llevarme a la corte esa me dice
mami yo he venido a llevarte
pero una cosa tú eres muy nerviosa
tú sabes como te dije hoy cuando nosotros estábamos buscando aquella noche un lugar para comer y yo vi tanta gente maleante
y tú me decías que eran hasta prostitutas
ahí yo me voy a pegar una cosa como esta no no
y cogí esa esa
no te dije nada cuando tú me dijiste que eran prostitutas algunas de ellas
yo dije
ahí no yo no
pero no te dije nada
pero se me hizo una cosa en el estómago que el hambre se me fue lejos
no
creo que lo que pedí fue un helado
horrible esa noche
ya ya se me quitó el hambre
entonces él me dice
tú eres una persona muy muy nerviosa mamá
y no te gustan las cosas
a mí un barrio un barrio no me gusta
no me gusta pasar por ahí
me parece como que
no es que me hagan algo
es que si se reúnen varias personas yo no puedo defenderme
con una sola no me importa
no no no no
y tenías un palo así para defenderte laughs
y tenía siempre bolsillos
y me lo metía así en el bolsillo
decía
si este desgraciado me viene a hacer algo va a saber quién soy yo
aha
es lo que me pueden hacer
porque si te llevan una prenda la prenda yo puedo comprar otra vez
pero no no si me no si me tiran al piso
y tú me puedes creer que la han cogido dos personas dos hombres esperando a una pobre mujer vieja ya
yo no me sé no sé la verdad qué tendría
pero no era ninguna joven
vive vive en xxx river
la esperaron que ella estaba para abrir el carro
ahí la atacaron
le cogieron la cartera
como ella no quiso dejar la cartera no quería dejar la cartera la tiraron al piso
y le partieron un brazo en dos partes
tú sabes cómo esa mujer sufrió
y eso es lo que yo trato de evitar que me hagan daño a mí
mami
no usar bar carteras caras
y era verdad porque rosana como costaban le le valían hasta doscientos y pico pesos y trescientos una cartera la carteriaron tres veces en el en el en el
en el subway
pues tenían que
allí
qué criminales
entonces
y a y al y a los tres meses ya está caminando como si nada
porque esos huesos están jovencitos están
pero los viejos no
mira los otros días
como ya veo que las cosas se están poniendo tan mal hasta hasta esperando una guagua una muere en estado que la cojan y la ultrajen
no eso de eso no tiene
entonces ah me fui a un lugar
y veo un como el que tú me regalaste el mismo pito que tú me regalaste en nueva york
me compré uno
que es de es de bronce
entonces lo voy a limpiar bien para ponérmelo en la cadena gruesa
y lo voy a guindar en la cadena gruesa que tengo ves
aquí lo voy a
mira laughs
aquí como tengo esa de cada día lo
entonces si algo pasa si ya yo como hacía con el mace en nueva york que enseguida me lo sacaba de la cartera y me lo ponía
lo voy a tener aquí en esta cadena
y empiezo a silbar como si
aha
no
por lo menos tratar de
la persona ves laughs
voy a la comandancia con unos perros claps hands
no
ayer mismo yo estoy planchando en la sala
y así tú verás la la la puerta está aquí y yo aquí parada planchando
siento una cosa como que se me hubieran tirado algo en la puerta claps hands
y yo pensé no pensé que era el gato que se había pirado
cuando fui a la ventana y miré no estaba el gato por ahí
lo que fue no sé
aha
pues yo enseguida fui
entonces no no había nadie
no había nadie
pero era diferente cuando yo tenía a mac
cuando yo tenía el perrito enseguida ladraba
y tú y tú sabías que estaba alguien alguien tocando
veremos a ver si algún día
no
oye pero tú te acuerdas aquella señora que tenía un perrito así y yo le pregunté si si lo vendía
eso eso después que salimos de allí tú me dices
oh wow
no este a mí me gustaría uno chiquito
la gente es descarada tú sabes
pasa por ahí
un día yo salí
y le digo
señora usted no está en su puerta
ni con leash pasaba ese perro por aquí
es por aquella cerca que usted está su puerta pasa
porque si ese perro hace sus necesidades aquí usted no tiene nada en sus manos para recogerlo
lo va a dejar ahí
no pues no no es tan supuesto
aha
eso no está bien
y es no respetar al a los demás personas
no
y no la he visto más
nunca pasó
que se vaya por otro building a hacer esa gracia
cuando yo me mudé ahí
que nos dijeron a mí y a tu padre que en paz descanse mire
usted tiene que cruzar
los perros se pasean se pasean por la por el por el fence más alto que hay
que ese es de ocho pies
pues por qué la gente no se lo dicen a todo el mundo y que todo el mundo obedezca eso
ah no pues que lo pasan por allí
ah
no pero eso eso es ahí chunguero
sí sí sí ya
pues mire yo le tengo miedo a esa estufa
yo no voy a que un día me coja la corriente o que haya un accidente aquí
no yo no voy a limpiar esa estufa por dentro
nada más por dentro limpio esta parte que usted ve limpia
lo demás no lo limpio porque ahí están los cables y
yo no voy a
no no no no no
se ha cogido candela dos veces
pero ahora cuando le llevo el de esto de home depot
me dice enseguida el que me había dicho que era de veintitrés no sé cuánto
eh me dice él
sí pero es que esta estufa es grande
ya me había dicho que macy no la tenía chiquita
que solamente eran grandes en en sears
bueno si eso es donde yo tengo crédito
entonces yo voy a home depot
mi hijo me la compra en home depot
y yo le podía pagando lo que sea
de veras
la televisión de la sala claps hands
la televisión de la sala
me da pena
me da lástima porque esa televisión en un especial costó cuatrocientos y pico pesos
y la compró tu
la compró tu padre como dos años dos meses antes de morir

pero como me dice que en un año más que esa televisión ya no hubiera servido para nada

oh she's

yeah but i'm saying where is she going after
she's not does she have grades f s u
well she coulda done so good here
the coach was like sara
they would have paid for everything
you don't get it
all she needed was ten more points
ten more points on her s a ts
you know what that is
it's like dot your i on your name
give me a break
it's like cross your fingers
you'll get it
you know
ten points dude
yeah but that but usually like they help you
if like your scores are low they still help you get in
but hers weren't like like she needed to improve them
like there wasn't anything the coach could do whatever
but he told her
he's like
improve them
i can give you dorm
i can give you
you know because if if she filed
that's crazy
bro she threw that all away
but you know what
when we stopped being friends that's when she left to t c c
for real
when we stopped being friends she was coming with me
i took her to all the all the coaches that that like every time the coach wanted to eat with her she didn't want him to know that she didn't have a car
would take her
you know
whatever
i took her to seriously like ten dinners
maybe like four
i took her to whatever
the coach was like super on her
he called her every day
all this stuff
the second we stopped being friends she was like
oh she thought everything was like this
but doesn't cathy go there for free
because you told her right about the thing
they have like flimsy jobs yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
well lucy had her phases
lucy had the craziest moments
do you remember when it was like
i remember when there was like a point that it was like people are like scared of lucy
like no one wanted to talk to her
she was that scary
because she was that
is she better now
oh she was insane
so you don't even look at a computer
like he just like he does it
but he just does as far as he gets you know what i mean
and like he'll have time to do like maybe
like we have to turn in a project for
like every couple three weeks you turn in a project
and then we have to do like one two or three tutorials
and when he does the tutorials like he'll get through like one in each class
but he won't like he won't go over all the material
the projects take like four hours to do so
so he doesn't go over all the material
and the only time that we like actually have in class time with the computer like the teacher like can help you
is on thursdays
and it's only
from twelve thirty to one forty five
yeah bro
flash drive
yeah bro
i've lost two already because i give them
i turn them in
and like the next week i forget to get them back
and then like the week after that he doesn't know where the hell they are
yeah
but
but he's like oh yeah
but because i don't know
he said there was something wrong with him
um
watch that girl that walks like a robot
yeah she lives in the everglades
but um
he doesn't
he says he's got a heart problem or something now
and so he doesn't check the work
like he actually has a person that helps him in another class check all the work for him
but when i asked him he's like
yeah yeah i have here that you did it
but i don't know like
i don't know what to tell you about your flash drive
so i brought through two other
i figured another one
because i did the same thing the last time we turned all our projects in
i don't know if it's him
it might be the other lady there
because we have a lady
but whatever bro
as long as he gets the the grades in in and stuff
dale
i don't care
um that's what i thought
take the nights bro
oh i thought you said the advanced class of that
yeah
i'm sure he does
i'm gonna ask him
he had to have taken it right
computer but mine was computer application for business
and then i have advanced computer application
international business and marketing
double major
yeah bro
now i told you how i found a lot of everything about that car bro
that it's two grand over the cost of of that car to get it fixed
for for like for like a two thousand one honda civic like with leather
and like i mean it's got a lot of extras and stuff
it's like seventy one hundred
and it the the estimate came back at ninety two hundred bro
like fifty
yeah
yeah
two thousand one
huh
because she bro it was her car from like when she was in high school
she bought that car when she was a sophomore
and then like she went to college or whatever
and and like didn't drive
she she went to u s f
so at that campus it's not like miami like you know what i mean
you go over there you just hang out there fraternity houses sorority houses or whatever
like go to city every once in a while
and she didn't come home
she came home like bro twice a semester
so she never really drove
and then she graduated from when she graduated from college and got that job working in new jersey
my parents but she got like seventy eight grand a year like right outta college banking
so my parents bought her a they bought her a new car
and and she just kept that car you know what i mean
uh princeton new jersey
yeah
yeah bro she likes it a lot
and i i think the only reason she likes it that much though is because she started dating this kid like three or four years ago bro
i don't even remember how long ago
i think it was like three years ago
but he lives he's from pittsburgh
and he goes to school in arizona
and like right about the time that she like she got the job she graduated in uh fall
in in spring of last year so o seven
and then got the job like right after that
and for fall of o of o seven her boyfriend came back to pittsburgh to do internship with u s view
and so they were right next to each other
i think something something with business
like marketing or um management business management something like that
he's a smart kid bro
yeah it was
and and now and now he's back in arizona so
but whatever man i've been working out for three years bro
yes but that's how everything up north is like
bro when i up to new york with adam this summer um bro it just got uglier and uglier the higher
like the farther farther north you go it just gets uglier
like florida is chill and nice sunny like palm trees you know nice and green
and then you get to like atlanta
and it's kind of the same
unless you're like in the city
whatever
and then in georgia and in north carolina
bro i drove from orlando i drove from tampa well from four miles all the way to buffalo new york over the summer
like couple like couple or three weeks before i started here at f i u at for for the fall
but um it just gets uglier bro
it's all sunny because of the smog
because it's all like down here it's all like farming
it's not like up up there
it's all like textiles and like factories and stuff
so it says like on the highways and stuff it says like
oh smog alert today from five to seven p m or whatever
and so it's always always just looks cloudy but it's not even clouds it's just smoke and fog and
yeah
but where she lives in princeton is like a nice area like a nice city in in new jersey so
it's a nice area
yeah
this is how it is up there
have you ever been in new york or anything man
bro that's how it is always up there it just it just looks dark
the winter is disgusting up there bro
i hate it
like we went up there like two years ago yeah two christmases ago
to meet this kid freddy my sister's boyfriend like we went to meet all their family
and um we went up there
we were there for a week and a half right
and seen the sun like twice maybe
like it you could see it like
bro you like it's bright out bro
it's like just as bright
but you can't even see the sun
like all you see is clouds
i don't like it
especially when you're used to florida
especially when you're used to florida bro
oh my god
yeah
i don't know
i don't think so
is it oh yeah i'm sure it does
but it's a different kind of hot than down here
i was there for christmas so
yeah like i've been in new york and stuff for the summer and stuff but we went to
no we went to we didn't go to the beach in new york we went to the beach in um damn bro what's it called
like a really rich expensive place
we went there with my grandmother
she used to have a house there
bro it's in new york or new jersey ah the hamptons
yeah we went there because she she had like a little house and we went there bro and it's mad nice mad nice because it's farther away from the city so there's not so much um smog in the air
cold cold it's always cold
and it was like ninety degrees out
like it was a nice day
and the water was like seventy like sixty seventy no matter what
really dark
the sand is ugly bro
the sand is like south beach sand
yeah it's like but it's real it's real sand
but it feels like the fake sand here
yeah
bro i wanna go to alaska and go fishing out there
go on a fishing and hunting trip
no brother there's some good fishing out there
whatever yeah i'm like big tuna and stuff
hunting go hunting for like elk do you go hunting a lot
yeah i i didn't we went hunting a lot just because our are hunters
man in it's like it's big over there bro
but hunting like elk or something big like that bro that'd be awesome
a bear
i think the nicest beach i've ever been to is in roatan bro
the island off the coast of honduras bro that place is beautiful man
and it's like
bro the water's like green like like that blue like light green because the sand is white
it's like sand white soft sand
yeah
so um the the water's like really really green bro
it's clear
it's awesome
our house over there is sick bro
it's like a hour drive from the city
like there's like three islands that that make up roatan
and uh roatan is one of the islands
and i can't remember what the other two are called
but we have a house in roatan which is the biggest island
and like on this side on like the left side of the island is all like hotels marinas
like because it's huge on diving because like here come like here's honduras
and the islands are right here
and like all of this like off the coast of mexico and um and like um guatemala and stuff
all of that is is like the second largest uh coral reef formation in the world
all of that
i can't remember
but it it like stretches all the way to roatan like it ends over there
oh my god yeah bro and like diving is
that's where i went scuba diving for the first time
my dad learned how to how to scuba dive from jean michel cousteau
jean cousteau's son yeah
he did his first night dive with him and everything
they jumped out of a helicopter one time
into the water at night yeah
when you when you you jump like that
and the the helicopter the helicopter is like twenty feet above the the water
and you just jump
with with full gear yeah
yeah
from like from like twice twice as high as as this
the the um
the helicopter comes down with a yeah
they they you put a a buoy
there's a buoy in certain spots
and you have to come back to the buoy
and he said you have you have uh under water like ten or fifteen feet under water
there's a blinker that goes off on the buoy that you can see for like miles under water
so you just have to like
because bro have you ever been night diving
i've never been
but my dad told me like it's the sickest craziest feeling ever
because you can be be going down bro and you think you're going up
because you don't you don't realize it
so there's like he says there's like a blinking ball just like a big light bulb
and it just blinks and blinks and blinks like every two seconds
so and you see it
so um and it's like two it's like ten ten fifteen feet under water
so you just go back to that whenever your your tank's almost out
and the helicopter will come back
yeah my grandmother bro the craziest story i've ever heard
my dad told me that when he was out there building the house because my dad was in notre dame he took it took him six years to graduate
like the the the school of architecture at notre dame takes like four and a half to five years
like it's a four year program
but if um like if you don't like do summer and all that stuff like it can take it usually takes people more than four years or whatever
but it took my dad six years because he took a year off and moved to roatan and built our house out there
so he said that when he was out there um bro he was it was like three or four o'clock one afternoon
like they just got done working
he just like grabbed a beer and went down to like grabbed a case of beer and went down to the to the dock and our dock
um remember i told you my uncle had that shrimping company
my grandfather whatever
wow that's like a mile down
like we own all that land all that side of the island
my grandparents owned like the entirety of it
like they've they've sold a lot of it now
but we own like all of it so the the thing's like a mile down
and the water is really it's not like here the beach
like it stays steady
like it's a a steady drop
because it's like in a bay
like the island's right here
and there's a little island like a little island right here that used to be an air strip
and then the coral reef is back here
so the water goes deep really quick
so the the dock goes out like fifty feet because bro my grandfather used to have a fifty two foot yacht out there
and the water is like a hundred feet deep at the end of the yacht at the end of the dock
it's like a fifty foot dock
so he said they were in there building the the dock
and they were done with like the first um like twenty feet of the dock
and he said that he saw um a manta ray just like swimming bro
he just saw it go under the the dock like farther out and then come back
and then he just said that he heard like a big bang
and then he saw the dock like a piece of the dock fall into the water
and he said that there was like a twelve foot uh hammerhead shark that was chasing the manta ray
and he he went underneath the the docks
and he broke the pilings there bro
it was probably like thirty feet deep forty feet deep where he hit it
and the pilings are big bro
and he just said that he broke right through them
and then they just kept going
yeah bro
bro we're planning a trip to honduras next summer
we're definitely going out there for like a week
no way how was that
dark water uh
it's cold yeah
bro there's nasty stuff in lakes bro
because there's something that falls in there
a hundred years later it's still there
no way how weird
that's creepy bro
like grass right
nasty
like mud
nasty
purple
no way
who'd you go with
oh yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah bro because your body stays that cold for a while
yeah one time
yeah for sure
but that's what most people don't like like a lot of people get that like hypothermia starts like early you know what i mean
you can be in the first stages of it and not realize it
one time we went to a to dela which is like the north coast beach in honduras
and we went to a um punta sal which is just like a little key that's off the coast or whatever
and bro my eyes are really really sensitive
like i can't like on bright days from here bro like i have to walk to class like this
my eyes just water and stuff i don't know why but um we went and bro i got insolado like so bad really really bad like my eyes got so swollen
like my eyes were swollen shut like all i can i can see like if you walk in front of me i can see you walking i can see there's somebody walking in front of me but i couldn't like see anything i couldn't like tell who you were or nothing
i got the worst headache of my life like i don't think it was a migraine but it was the worst headache i've ever had in my life and i had to stay in bed um and your whole body just feels hot bro you just feel hot the whole entire time for like a whole day bro
oh yeah
oh yeah
how
burning
the worst pain i ever got was i haven't told you the story
me and my cousin were messing around at at uh um at my grandmother's house
and it was her birthday
and she was having like a huge event
like the newspaper was coming and stuff
like huge huge thing
so like um before right before even starting like in the morning me and my cousin went there it's like
in honduras like my grandmother's house like my aunt's house is inside the gates because she is the youngest one
so my grandfather made her a house because she is the only one there
like she came to school herebut she moved back as soon as she graduated
everybody else in my dad's family like when they came to school here they stayed here for at least a couple years
so they made her a house over there
and it's like my cousin's house my grandmother's house's stables and then my house
so i was always at my grandmother's house with my cousin
like after school you just get dropped off there
and like just chill there all day
so we spent the night there
and like ten in the morning bro we were messing out in the backyard
and um i was like nine or ten and he was like twelve or thirteen
and bro he starts pissing
and like we were both pissing

por qué
quién te ha dicho que él se ha muerto
él llegó a ser doctor
no
cuándo
oiga eso es noticia para mí
y quién te dijo eso
o sea super chévere la rumba
pero como que no es lo mismo porque yo acostumbrada a toda mi vida aquí siempre
quiero comprarme un desodorante papi
necesito un desodorante
necesito un tampon papi
y yo con veinte años diciéndole a mi papá que necesito necesito que me dé cinco mil pesos para ir a comprarme una caja de de de tampons pues
y lógicamente como al principio cuando yo me iba a volver era sola
y toda mi familia se quedaba allá
porque tenía que vivir en la casa de un tío
y fue cuando entré a trabajar a al consultorio odontológico
siempre estaba muy involucrada en la odontología
pero era trabajo de doce horas diarias
era todo el día
y entonces en diciembre mis papás vinieron con toda mi familia
y estuvimos esquiando en new hampshire porque
y y no el nos fuimos a esquiar
super rico estar una semana quince días estuvimos esquiando
ése es su país y él creció en colombia realmente
entonces él realmente creció en colombia él
y que tiene lo que tiene por estados unidos
pero que colombia es colombia
él no deja de ser colombiano por nada en el mundo
que by the way se vino ilegal
y mamá también cuando se vinieron ellos se vinieron
que él decía
i've i've never heard of you know colombians in l a
es porque realmente no
mis papás se vinieron por el hueco por o sea méjico
y mi mamá estaba embarazada ya conmigo pues de mí
o sea yo de mi cinco
no importa porque ellos no tienen por qué cogerlos y y y digamos um
eso no lo pueden hacer eso es ilegal
eso no se puede hacer
tú no puedes coger y y mientras deja una persona
eso tiene que hacer bajo investigaciones
y bueno realmente mis papás mi papá tenía creo que si no estoy mal veintiséis veintisiete años
y mi mamá tenía tenía diecinueve años cuando nací yo
es que lo que te digo yo
soy super apegada a
o sea soy muy independiente
pero soy una persona muy familiar
me aterra estar eh sola por ajá lejos
pero realmente tu familia es la única que siempre
same thing happened to me
he's an architect
if anything
but every semester you saw the same people
you actually make friends like real friends
same ideas
in my case when when i go to dental school
and you know i i guess the classes are gonna be mandatory for everyone at
the classes number one are not gonna be small guaranteed
and you know it's funny because i was talking to him last night about that and he was all
time flies
everyone has you know bills to pay
you know that that you're still in school and your career
if you wanna eat somewhere
if you wanna buy this
and plus you know that's why everything's more you know personalised
whereas here the schedules might be different for everyone
pero te lo digo llegaba el viernes y yo lo único que quería era dormir
todo el domingo era una cosa
y yo decía dios mío no puede ser
pero at a different level
because she deals with more like paperwork
entonces no es solamente el paperwork
porque también tenemos que hacer el papeleo
sarcasm um
because people give you attitudes and everything
and you have to learn to deal with that
entonces es difícil es difícil
tratar con la gente no es fácil
y bueno yo te conté que mi papá tiene el negocio éste del subway
en
yo soy la que abro y y
it is you know
it's nothing
hay gente es que te hacen la vida imposible
pienso que hay una barrera un límite para todo
because it's ridiculous that it because of the customer always being right
so so i you know i took care of him whatever
i did his sandwiches
and he was with i guess his parents
i took care of them i
you know i made them sandwiches
and then we used to give out our courtesy cups for water
if they approve it
they were actually taking soda from the fountain machine
so what we did was we you know we weren't we weren't um gonna give out courtesy cups any more
when i go to charge him he asks me for three courtesy cups
and i tell him i'm because he was used to going whatever and getting the cups
and i tell him sorry sir but we're no longer giving you know courtesy cups
because we've had several issues with several clients
and then so he responded to me he said
let me just remember like the exact words
he goes to me he goes
so what am i supposed to do drink water out of my hands
like with that you know with sarcasm
i told him
well if you wanna drink water out of your hands like an animal go ahead be my guest that's not my problem
now if you wanna drink like a normal human being you know like an educated person
i told him yeah
it might be ridiculous to you but you know what the word courtesy means
that's up to us if we wanna give it for free or not
because the word says it all courtesy cups
it's either you learn to respect and accept you know the things that are going on
i was actually pretty nice you know to you when i tried to tell you that we had no cups any more
and you respond to me you know aggressively and with sarcasm
if you like that you can stay
you can buy a cup
and you know you're more than welcome to be our client
but if not there's a million subways out there
el tipo se queda así como que
porque ellos o sea lo que te digo la gente
menos que uno
hasta que no te toca estar en el el lugar
bien
si no goodbye
pero para una persona
yo llego a presenciar eso con uno des mis empleados
y lo mismo que te dije de mí se lo digo de de mi empleado
es increíble uno uno
no sé si has escuchado de él en el momento
él salía el le dicen el el doctor de las celebridades especialmente lo
y bueno él ha hecho makeovers a actrices y actores mejicanos colombianos y ahí va
y realmente la mayoría de nuestros pacientes son pacientes tú sabes
pero el noventa por ciento de los pacientes es puro cash income every day
y y las cosas no no tienen por que ser así
exactamente pero hay gente que llega allí y y realmente
también hay pacientes con mucha plata
tenemos pacientes franceses
no no se preocupe que aquí no ganamos por comisión
y puedes querer explotar
o colgar y decir que se te cayó la llamada cualquiera estupidez
y uno no creería que en un consultorio médico
es el hombre no le dice nada a absolutamente a nadie
o sea le puedes decir por ejemplo mira no comparto tu opinión o no sé
de que por ajá atrás porque
y pero de todas maneras tú sabes a cualquiera a cualquiera le saca de quicio
y lo que pasa es que él también hay veces hacer las cosas mal
llega a tal hora ven a tal no sé qué
y le dijo a un paciente que llegara por un limpieza
el caso es que a esa hora
le dice a la higienista que necesita que lo vea
y la paciente acababa de colgar que ya venía en camino que llegaba en cinco minutos
la citaba a las nueve y eran las ocho y cincuenta y cinco algo así
y le dijo ah listo no perfecto
y y inclusive alma que es la higienista fue la que contestó el teléfono
llega ese señor
nada personal pero sí hay unos muy groseros
mira yo necesito que me vea ya
mira eh yo no puedo atendérte en este momento
me acaba de confirmar
si quieres eh
y yo termino con ella en cuarenta minutos más o menos
te hago la limpieza
ha hecho un escándalo en ese consultorio
tienes que saber quién es
y hace un programa en la radio en
creo que es en romance o en amor
ay no sé el
ese hombre ha hecho un escándalo en ese consultorio
i'm sorry i can't see you
no pero yo necesito que me veas ya
es que roberto
ni siquiera dice el doctor
es que roberto me dijo que viniera que viniera a tal hora y es más
tú me vas a decir que no me vas a atender que no sé qué
entonces ella le dijo que lo sentía que le si lo quería le esperara
eso fue en el front desk en el reception
en otro teníamos otro paciente en un cuarto
la pobre señora una señora vieja
parece unos cincuenta y pico años
imagínate tener que escuchar todo ese escándalo
y yo me quedé haciendo papel de la recepcionista
porque él llegaba más tarde
y empieza este hombre
no sé qué pendeja
ella ha ido que está haciendo mira contestando llamadas porque la señora llamaba de emergencia al celular y la estaba ignorando por teléfono
y no me quiere atender
y entonces vaya hablar con esa otra señora que es otra paciente
a mí no me interesa quien sea
yo soy juan garcía
yo me quedé así
y entonces yo no decía nada porque yo no me quería meter
porque entonces el problema habría sido más grande
yo digo
pero por dentro estoy diciendo hijo puta o sea
dónde está
él supuestamente famoso
se paró así
así adentro ya al consultorio la tiró
ah no se qué
tú no me vas a tocar en mi boca ya
no quiero que me abre la boca
no quiero que me toque en la boca
que yo
y olvídate que sea como sea su nombre y
te digo en serio
si tú no quieres entonces tú esperas y le dices

and
yes with yourself
well she was telling me about this thing with oprah
that she's a new age thing
and she's a book
and she has a video blog
and she's promoting her book after her show
it's weird
i'm gonna go online to see what it's all about
yeah like that your own you're your own god
and stuff like that
i guess
yeah
oh
no
i don't know
i think it's getting to her head that she's like
very influential or something
i've never watched oprah
and the drama continues
he's good he's good
i'm leaving on friday
the chair
yeah
i rather yeah email it to me
ah my lord
but yeah you do see her
ay how funny
yeah just plain just sin nada
yeah yeah i know i know
just email it to me
yo se lo mando a fernando
yeah
no but he's good
he's moving
to to um
he no with his mom
he's moving with his they're moving from from the house there right
and right now
porque it's a lot cheaper
it's like almost fifty dollars cheaper
in rent
they sold their house
but the thing is
that es su tío that has lived with him like i don't know how like ya several years
he doesn't pay anything
él no paga nada en la casa
like he doesn't like even water
and he he lives there with his
he lives there with his wife and his daughter
and i understand see you know if you don't have enough money at least algo you know
but nothing
so his mom's like
i can't i can't mantener su familia any more you know
i
yeah you know
and she's retired the
her gran she she's responsible for the you know her mom
and her her older daughter
pero ella es ella es enfermita
so fernando's like fed up with it
well the thing is that they started looking for a new house to move in
uhhuh and his nieces
if she wants to go with them
because she was taking
yeah she lives somewhere else
but the grandmother was taking you know her son's side
but the thing is that yeah
i don't know yeah
it's a little machista
yeah
yeah i don't know if it's like this hispanic thing
that the men are
no matter what the
my grandma was the same way with my brother
that's low
it's not it's it's it's in general
i think it's like all
yeah but
wow well the thing is that they found this place right
but the house comes with a little efficiency
outside
within the the
you know within the area
and so fernando's like
well just tell my uncle that he wants to go live with us that the he can rent the apartment out
don't don't yeah don't let him know that the that it comes with the house
so they're they're like
well if you wanna move in next to us it's cheap it's fifty dollars
and you're not gonna get cheaper than that anywhere
so he's gonna pay for the fifty dollars his water his light
he thinks that he he's that he's just helping out
it's kind of it's you know but that was the only way
to make him you know
because apparently he he can't afford living on his own
uh i know the situation's difficult y todo and but
a lot of um yeah
yes
and somehow fernando's
one little girl
not even
and fernando's mom retired
and fernando are sustaining all of them

so it the he it probably is included in the price
he had to put it in this thing right
you wanna rewire or
how the hell can you move it from one receiver to the other
not impossible that's doable
so it's it's gonna be two hundred bucks
i thought they were going to keep windows
didn't jared say he could do that too
yeah
ok
ok just delete it
whatever no i have a mine is better
go to hell bitch
no laugh
you're the corniest person in the entire fricking
welsh
no english
ok baby
ok darling
is this another family guy reference
oh my god
ok
i went to all the websites today
i had so much i wanted to show you
i know
as usual
ah
ya
córtala
oh my god
you're so annoying sometimes
oh yeah
oh if we go over five thirty
oh oh she emailed me back
the lady from flamingo gardens
she said that we can have more than a hundred guests
but we're gonna have to pay for their chairs
like bring in the chairs from an outside rental
yeah because they only had a hundred chairs
uh you what
i'm just gonna leave the hundred chairs
and the kids can sit on their parents laps
or you know do whatever the hell
oh and um they don't close down the the park if you have a wedding
they it's uh still open to the public
i don't like that either
and if you're in the wedding party you can't go you can't go roam around the park and look at things
unless you pay the twelve bucks
well i'm paying like two thousand bucks
no
unless everyone pays
she said that she said that you can get the fifteen or more group discount
and it'll cost you less money
hey that's why she said twelve i think instead of
because with the group discount you get like like twelve dollars for adults
versus seventeen it's a huge difference
no no no i mean if they wanna walk around they can go on their own
i'm not gonna yeah
i think by now it should be fixed
look how pretty the gazebo looks
did you see it
oh my god
they're gonna be like
what the hell are you talking about
it's from the teacher reference
ignore him
ok so flamingo gardens
because i don't want them to think you're crazy or something

there you go ok look
under weddings
oh my god
who knows how many things you downloaded into your computer
look how beautiful the gazebo is for the ceremony
oh my god stop saying
uhhuh
that's it
that's the three of us and then
uhhuh
in front
no it has a little it has a little entrance
right
and then you have the seats would be in front of it
mira
where's the pen
we're not gonna be all the way back there
that's that's that's contorted babe
ok
oh my god
ok so this is the gazebo
no they meant ok
they had this like neighbour who went out of town
and she left their her her parrot
in yeah in her in her cage in the back yard
under like under their care
and mom said that she was outside the not this like this past week the the week before
and the dog kept on jumping up on the cage jumping up on the cage and after the parrot
my mom got was trying my mom was getting annoyed right
i mean first of all she hates the dog
everyone hates the dog
except for roger
because
have you stepped outside
with that dog there
he jumps up to your fricking face
and he he attacks
he he he's too he's too
yeah he he's having fun when he kills little animals and shit
he's not a nice dog
roger has him trained for hunting
yeah well they haven't socialised him
because the girls are scared of him
he doesn't get wrong he doesn't get along with other dogs
he's just a little menace
oh my god ok
it's it's based on a cartoon strip in a cartoon show
it's better as a cartoon strip on a cartoon show
ok well
my mom went outside
and she sees the dog jumping on the thing
and trying to kill the trying to get to the parrot right
and mom says she grabbed him by the neck choked him and started like you know trying to
yeah
yes
no it's a little um
that wasn't funny
ok so she was choking the fricking dog
no it's not bo
it's the the little white one
i don't know what the hell it is
a little terrier or
ok god
ya laugh
o k
my mom was choking
my mom says that dog is a freak of nature
because she was choking and choking and choking it nothing
the thing is that he would just keep on going like it's all good
she got the manguera
started hitting him
no he was trying to
he she was trying
he my mom got the manguera
started hitting him with the manguera
nothing
he just kept on going at the at the cage like it was all good nothing
he doesn't feel a thing
and then
because it was gonna it was trying to eat the parrot
and it turns out that he ate the parrot
my mom my mom was saying that she wishes that the dog would just die
because it's
um
the the my mom said that they had to take him to the vet
and like they put like the the they give him i guess an enema
and pumped his stomach
because of the bones of the parrot inside of him
i guess
no a she he's gonna have to tell her
my killer dog ate your parrot
no but that that cage was huge
and it was a strong cage
the dog knocked the cage over
and the dog ate the parrot
no no no no because the thing is it's
ok it's like the two part ones where you have the base
and then you have i guess a a cage on top which is um in i guess in the shape of a canopy
so if you knock it off uhhuh
so the the dog knocked it over
those parrots have their wings clipped most of the time
yeah they can't fly
they flew they would've they would've gone
yeah sigh
my mom says that jock is probably next
my mom says that she no she said that she wishes that he would eat jock
because if he eats jock they'll get rid of the dog
because they're they all attached to jock
he should go
he's not gonna get rid of it laugh
he loves the dog
so what do you think of the the gazebo
i don't even remember it
oh my god stop calling it that
ok
so yeah and then they have the rates yeah
if they can do the gazebo
and then the garden area
it says
for use during ceremonies
that's what i wanted to use for the actual reception
i don't wanna use the barbecue pavilion
that's like retarded
hmm
hopefully if you want to
if not no
no i was planning on being done by then
costs too much money
wait from five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty it'll be like three hundred bucks
the sunset goes on around eight
in
oh my god yeah
it'll be like i wanna do it like february or march
that's true
and these people don't have anything about you can't use you know candles or you can't use you know uh the little sparklers
so you can do the sparkler thing
no you can't
yes it's a sanctuary yeah
the only thing that they they they have that they specifically say no to is the is the alcohol
no luke
so what do you think of flamingo garden
which is why
i think we should go with our families
it counts for my class
it counts
i would like my parents to go
because they have never been to that park
and it's really lovely
yeah but we can kill two birds with one stone
and spend some time with the family
and go look
shut the fuck up laugh
ay jesu cristo
yeah half a page of shut the fuck up
we don't need wedding counselling right or marriage counselling
we're perfectly fine
that's one of the suggestions on one of those websites get to get counselling before you're married
yeah
like if necessary
i'm like what the fuck if you're getting married you shouldn't be needing counselling
we're not getting a pre nup
that's absurd
uh oh yeah ninety per cent of zero
what is that
oh really
make it big in what
in history
stop no don't do that
put it away
it scares me
we could save so much money if we only had twenty guests
the ceremony for up to twenty guests two hundred and fifty dollars that's it
i i have i have to email them about the reception if we can meet them in the garden area in front
ray home verandah
wait wait if this the ray home verandah says canopy of live oak surrounding the historic home
so would that imply that the that the thing would be outside the reception
ok that that sounds good
no no no because i wanted outdoor
remember the whole tea thing i wanted to be outdoors
not indoors
i don't think we'll need it
you're not wearing a tuxedo
i don't want you to
i want it to be really casual
so like i was thinking a um a nice
i dunno a tan suit or something like the tan
with a nice a the pink shirt or something really relaxed
now i'm making all these and these concessions right
uh
take it seriously
no because of the whole religion thing
yeah but we're still doing we're still having my uncle who's a pastor
who is gonna marry us
they don't he doesn't the the christian church doesn't do the whole you know use the blood of christ and all that crap he's
i do want some
and
well
well you know what i i i need a little bit of of if he if he asks for a little bit of liberty in that for you to respect it
i don't know
uh well considering
the the the invitations so far as i have imagined them are in english
but then i was thinking everyone in the fucking family speaks spanish
what the fuck are we gonna do
are we gonna are we gonna send everyone who speaks spanish an english invitation
luke
no pero doing it in spanish
who
who got my fifteenth invitation in spanish and knew how to get there
no
amore@sita
you know i i don't wanna do i didn't wanna do it in spanish
but it it makes more sense
being it's more it's more sensitive to our family situation
because i wanted to do that introduction on the top
well obviously it's not for us
it doesn't have the same connotation you know
this is the gazebo thing
look the layout
no no no no but it ok i'm not gonna
the vows are something personal
no one else it doesn't matter if the whole fucking ceremony is in english
sorry i'm i'm i'm gone somewhere
oh you little laugh
mira
ok sweetheart
thank you
ok
ese en el this is the layout of the gazebo
it's not
and this will be like el camino
and then you have a little
we would set up the chairs
there's also one called nova
ok
so this would be like the walkway
and then you have the different rows of
the different rows of the chairs
i found this website that does the the fans right
the but like ok
there there are rectangular
no uh the the fans are the paper fans
ok
they're rectangular
ok traditionally what you do is that you give out um a program at the ceremony
that basically says our names the maid of honour the best man
and a a small little
ok but when i'm doing that
no
ok
this is what i'm trying to tell you
they have them on on a couple websites where it's a a rectangular thick card stock paper fan
and then it has a cute little design on there
little flowers and stuff
and you has it has the program on it
so it's a it's like a little
those cost more money
this i can get like
yeah and it'll also be about a dollar each
yeah and a whatever
the little stick
these are about a dollar each
or whatever
the the the fans that open up
the they have these silk ones
they have paper ones
they have the little wooden ones all of them
the cheapest one is a dollar fifty each
which is why i wanted you to take me to that chinese store
no
it doesn't none of them allow you to put the program on it
you would have to print it out separately and glue it on or something
or we can do programs printed out and rolled up into little thingies
and then have the fans on top of it
because you have uh
i think it would be really mean of us to have an outdoor wedding and not be not offer fans
for the people
oh because i wanna have a spring wedding
i don't wanna have a winter wedding
i don't wanna have a summer wedding
i like spring
sixty five too cold
i'm not getting a huge poofy dress luke
there's some there'll be a lot of old people
old people still can't handle it
the heat
the temperature it's not good for old people
you wait wait till you're old you know
i'm worried we can't anticipate whether or not it's gonna be seventy degrees or eighty degrees or ninety degrees
no my parents don't even know about this idea
and no they're not that old thank you
oh my god
yeah and my my parents are older than yours
and yet my mom can do more than your mom can do
because your mom is in pain twenty four seven
when my mom was your age was your mom's age my mom could do anything
because your mom's a vieja
no meat on her bones
are you ignoring like two hundred pounds of meat or what
my mom
fuck you
mira
vas a buscar problema
that's all that's the house by the way
and they have in the back supposedly
i haven't seen it
i remember
we saw it in person
but it was after the hurricane
so it looked like shit
they have tours
we can go take a tour of the house
i really wanna go back
i really wanted to go back with my parents and the girls
that'd be nice
have a little day out
and enjoy the park
then the uh uh
i i just don't even want to look at it
the spanish monastery any more
i i i was disappointed when i went there
and the place is so small and gloomy
it looks gloomy
it doesn't even look like a happy place
no babe
and there was the other place what was it
i'm gonna go to my email
let me find it
it was that house in little havana
she is actually putting of her own money
like she
and so now what's happening is basically what they're saying is that in order for barack to win like the entire election in order for him to become president he has to basically get her support
so he can get so he can get the rest of the democrats that she has because she has a couple
they want him to get the rest of the democrats
and if he gets the rest of the democrats that's it
he becomes the next president
yup
a black president
no
ok ok
when when two people like running like that
i'm not
no no no it's not that they already know who's gonna win
what's happened is basically that um they're running against each other for the same within the same party
like they're both on the same team if you will
and basically like you know there's there comes a certain point when you you already know
like they keep like you know like
yeah
so now they already know that he's the one that he's gonna be running for that team
so there's no reason for her to still be there
but she doesn't want to give up
but whatever
don't feel bad for her
yeah i want barack obama to win
yeah of course because you want you know you want her to you know change
so what's going on with your hair
it looks very nice today
you look nice though
you're welcome
thank you i wear it all the time
well thank you
i was gonna i was gonna tell you that
so why why do you think that i was like mad at you
i don't understand
actually no the reason why is because like like i kind of felt bad like about what happened
and i don't really want like for me to be the issue like between you and my mom
you know like i don't want that i don't want myself to come up in like anyway or form possible like
and it's and like kind of i was just kind of like
well you know like like i don't know what to do
because the thing is like the thing is i you know
yeah
you know i don't have to say it
but it's just like i think sometimes like it when i try to like talk to you and stuff like that like it can be taken as like ammunition you know to like
like the fights can get worse just because you know like something might happen between us or whatever
and i'm just like
i just kind of felt bad because like the last thing that i want is for you and my mom to fight like over something stupid that happened between us you know
and i'm just like whatever
kind of like the same
yeah
go ahead
no go ahead
kind of like the reason you gave for not like doing that thing a long time ago when i asked you
i'm trying to be like
yeah
it's kind of like the same reason that you gave her
like you don't want like your relationship to go bad because of what happens between us basically
you
but i wasn't mad at you
like it doesn't make any sense
think about it
i mean you called me in order to talk to my mom
and i picked up the phone
oh ok alright
you thought i was
you see you don't really know me like
i mean i told you i was mad for like one day
and then i was like forget it
i didn't i didn't
yeah
what do you mean what did i do today
uh i tried to get some more people
like i made some phone calls
uh for the bilingual research study
and like i i've been doing a lot of reading
yeah
you didn't go to school today
and you and you stayed in bed
how much longer do you have to go
i mean you're half way through the summer right
really
and how do you feel now
the morning sickness
you're not pregnant are you
that's morning sickness
you get up in the morning
you can't get up
you're sick
you're laughs
yeah there you go laughs
yeah that that that would be pretty funny
but whatever um
yeah
what like jesus like uh mary mary jesus funny
yeah i i don't think so
so you like the radio station
yeah it's really funny
i listen it i listen to it now all the time
i don't know it's it makes me laugh
and there's like so much stuff like good stuff
like they talk about stuff like you heard like the stuff about and stuff like that
they talk about politics
good talks about politics
not like that crap where it's like oh you know it's all over your head
you know good politics
and uh no they have like they're always giving away money
yeah yeah yeah
always giving away money
they're the people that were giving away the tickets for the the concert
yeah
i never called
but i should have called
i probably woulda won some
and i coulda gone by myself
i'm just joking laughs
i can't believe you
you that's the one thing that i really
that's the thing that makes me angry that i don't
because the thing is like the the thing is like ok look
let's be honest with each other
like i would have gone like if i really wanted to go to the concert i would have gone regardless
like i would have just bought the tickets
like i would have just said
forget elizabeth i'm going
ok but but like at the same time you know you know it's not just like you know going together
that's not the point
the point is going together and having a good time
and i know you wanted to go to the concert
so it was important you know that you had a good time
so when you tell me like
oh i didn't even have a good time
i was like
i was like
great
so like
yeah
yeah
yes yes let's not let's not
there will be more
oh so now you're saying there will be more concerts
for that
yeah ok
no comment laughs
um
yeah i kinda helped my parents out a little bit
um i was kinda i kinda figured that i would just be doing this
so i was like ah you know whatever
i've been studying for the for the g r e too
you know like
but like there's a lot of vocabulary in that thing
i have like four hundred like index cards that i did
additional index cards of like words and stuff like that so
and like wow that's a lot of stuff
like i've just been writing like this whole time like just putting all the words on index cards
it's taking me forever
i don't know
i really don't know
i mean i thought i would be done by you know by mid june
and i'm still like taking down like words you know so
i took a practice test though
i got
i did really i did better on the math than i did on the
yeah
yes
yea
there's a and a math portion
i did ok like
i had not really studied
i had just looked over everything really briefly
but whatever
like it's weird
like the test basically like adapts itself to you
like it asks you questions
and then like if you get them wrong it asks it asks your an easier question
and it goes like that
it asks you hard questions and easier questions
really
yeah
you know i really wish you had come to that party
yeah
i really do
it would have been it would have been a lot better
i think you know to be honest with you i think that given enough time like like you would have become like really like really really good friends i think
because we get along
for the most part
who said anything about being mean
hey don't get a big head on me all right
aw
you're a philanthropist
that's so messed up
oh of course of course
what about me
what you think i wasn't popular in high school
what what are you saying laughs
you said no laughs
that was a reaction laughs
i was actually really popular in middle school
and then like because of how popular i was in middle school i decided that i didn't want to be popular any more
no seriously i was like really popular yeah
no it's true
it happened
it was something about my hair
it made me cool
yeah
because i used to have like a a
i told you this
i used to have a lot of hair
and it was like really curly
and i used to put a lot of gel in it
so all the girls would be like
oh let me touch your hair
and i'd be like
hey
you like mohawks
yeah
like bees wax
yeah
yeah
so yeah like it used to get hard like after like after a certain time
then in the afternoon it was like hard like all
and it was like curled and stuff like that
rock hard laughs
i don't think it's not like like as you get older you realize that it's not necessary necessarily necessary
you know
it's just something that you know it's cool like when you're growing up
you're like
oh
you wanna do something with your hair
so you start slicking it back
and everybody's like
oh watch out
yeah yeah yeah
am i ready for the wedding
you know i'm still trying to decide ah on how many days i'm gonna spend up there
yeah
my father's coming uh a little bit after my mom with my brother
so he's only gonna be there for like three days
so they're so like the weekend basically
and i don't know whether i wanna like go in for like the entire week or just spend the weekend
like i'm still i still haven't decided
yeah
i'm trying to figure that out
the thing is like the thing is like once the thing is when you get up there you're gonna see like they're really like in wedding mode you know like
wedding mode
you know so it's all about the wedding
and like you really you feel out of place
it's like you go
and like you're a girl so you're gonna be fine
and you're gonna
you know they're gonna be like
oh yeah you know help me put on this dress whatever
let's go shopping for the shoes
we still need this
and they're gonna take you with them
they're gonna drag you up and down all over the place
with guys it's different
like you can't
like that you don't really get included you know like that
you know you hang out with the other guys and
like i guess i guess the only reason to go would be to just get to know um isabella a little bit better
you know my cynthia'seng son
yeah
and probably fernando because honestly like i don't know either of them like any of them like luis you know junior luis like
and fernando like i've met him
and like talked to him like maybe like twice and stuff like that
but i really haven't
i don't even know him that well you know
my mom's spent like uh like two weeks up there
like he took her out and whatever
they got to know each other so
what about
how do you feel about it
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
you've never been to a wedding before
that's shocking
that is shocking
it's really nice
it's really nice
like you have a party
it's it's nice
no i mean i mean for the most part like my mom tends to hang out with um uh cynthia
cynthia
so whatever you'll get to know her
and cynthia you already know
and cynthia is just her sister you know so
that's it
and then like on my father's side of the family i don't know what they're gonna do with that
i don't know if they're gonna introduce you to my father's side of the family
that remains to be seen
like my mom doesn't
like they get along
but it's just like they're
they've had a lot of problems you know like
a lot of stuff has happened
tough stuff with them
my brother loves though you know
oh yeah
you know you can't get enough of them because they're they're more like
i guess they're more er um
how can i say this
urban centric
you know more like he is
because he doesn't he doesn't take after like the whole christian side you know
and like cynthia you know
and cynthia and their cities are more like christian and stuff like that
i mean they're cool and stuff like that but
you know they're christians so you can't you know certain things there are certain limits to what you can do you know
but whatever we'll see we'll see how it goes
but yeah
the school is really big
yeah it kinda is
it gets bigger all the time
you just go in and study and come back
yeah
yeah
why would you be in a hurry to get home
yeah
you don't think you're ever home
you know that's
it happens though
it's not it's not just you
a lot of people live like that
the to be honest with you like that's one of the things that i'm very grateful for right now that i have so much free time in the summer
because i've come to realize that especially during the these last two semesters at school like i've been spending just so much time like just doing crazy stuff like trying to get stuff done
and always like hurrying
and always being like you know
trying to be like one step ahead of everything
and i'm like
like i don't know like about maybe like a week ago is when i finally just like let go of all that
you know just like just relax
and finally just let it go
like you don't really have to do anything tomorrow you know just
and like i i rested
and i was like
i realize like man you know like man so much time like gets wasted on like you know watching television you know like looking stuff up on the internet
something you don't even need to look up just like garbage
you know and it's like
when i finally just let it go i was just like ah
like i finally like just read i finally i read an entire magazine like between yesterday and today
and i was like
oh this is great
you know i read the entire magazine
i mean it's not it's not enough
i mean just having a bachelors is not
it's it's all about you
you know it really is about you
you know like i i like the degree
i'm not gonna lie to you
i think it's nice and everything
but i don't think the degree defines who i am you know
it's the degree is just a reflection of like my commitment you know of what i decided to do you know in my life you know
like i already i had i already knew like that summer like when i came back to school that you know i was gonna finish
one way or another i was gonna finish
and the only thing that i kept telling me uh telling myself is like colin you have four years left
you know you just have to hang in there for four years
just keep going
that's the only way i made it through
there were times when like like i was like really messed up where it's like you know i had to stay up for like three a m in the morning four a m in the morning like writing a paper and stuff like that
and it's hard
yeah
right
hmm
it just depends
i mean there's a point in your life when you realize that
i like that's interesting that you say that
because i don't really know what exactly it is about high school that you wanna go back like what it is about high school that you like so much
that's the thing
what is it
yeah
right
right
right right
right
when i was that actually my my my college g p a went down to a two point one so
yeah
no what am i
wait
two point one
no what am i talking about
one point a one point two
well
it's it's
i don't think it's really about
i don't know
i've been to people's houses that like you know that you know have education have an education
and they have several degrees
and stuff like that
and to be honest with you it's not
you know i look at their lives
and and i don't really want that life
you know like that's not what i want
you know i don't look at their lives and say like wow you know i envy that
you know and that's what i want
um the only to me like the only motivation for me to like do well is is first for myself and also for you know for whatever future i might have with somebody else basically
you know i think of it in that in that sense you know
i i always wanna be i always have a backup plan you know
i always wanna be prepared in case anything might happen
and it's just having a better life for you know for not just yourself but for other people too
you know
you bring something to the table like you know whenever like you meet anybody
so yeah but trust me
just because you have an education doesn't mean squat like
like that girl that i told you about that i like i went out for like a for like a month she was like she's working on her masters now and it's like like you just feel bad for her
like honestly that's the only thing i can tell you
like i felt bad for her
because like there's nothing you can do like
you know it's like she's thirty and she still hasn't figured out that you know if she doesn't like put on the batteries like she's just gonna be alone for like the rest of her life like
my god she's like thirty
and like she she just turned thirty
and she's like still like going out like partying and drinking and stuff like that
and it's just like
i'm like
and like she's having such a hard time like letting go of like that part of her life
like she's kinda like has like half and half right now
so whatever i'm like whatever
but that's you know that's that's her choice
you know like that's her choice
what ends up what happens with most people though is that um they don't realize that they don't really know what they want you know
i actually asked this to my mom the other day
like i was like
tell me the truth
when you were like young you know did you know what you want with your life
and she was like
no
and i was like
ah ha you see i knew it
and i just walked away
that's what happens though
that's what happens
just the thing is
you know what you know why because what ends up happening is that eventually the problems that you might not have paid attention to like you eventually say to yourself
you know i gotta resolve them
it happened to me too
there are problems that you have to take care of
you just have to learn to be happy regardless of what you're doing
regardless of what you're doing
you just have to learn how to do that
like me it doesn't where you put me
my mom laughs
she's like
it's fine
you know you can come like a week before the wedding
it doesn't matter
we'll just put you in the living room with a book
and you'll be fine
so that's something that you have to learn
like but whatever
no it's you know it's interesting
i dunno like
i think that sometimes that i think we try to get away from from feeling you know and and thinking about things about things that should matter
you know
i think so
i think that that's the point of having so many distractions
for example i think that sometimes people get scared of being like absolutely alone like with nothing going on
yeah
like people get like you put them in like for example have you
what's the longest you've spent like by yourself with like nothing going on
you see
you see
but why
why do you hate it
yeah you go do something else right
i i'm actually quite like the opposite
like the thing is this like it's hard like it's hard to get to a place where you're just like you're alone like and you can actually think you know and just think about whatever comes into your head you know like
you know why are things the way they are you know
have all these like weird thoughts
and it's like
i feel like most of your life you go through you go through it
you know you just
people like yelling in your ear all the time
that's what it feels like to me
like it feels like people are always yelling at me
you know like not literally
you know what i mean like
but that's what i feel like it's like it's happening
like there's always like something going on
and then it's never like we never get a chance to just like think
you know just like concentrate on like
it's funny because it's like
i've been sitting around and thinking about the test you know and studying for it
and i'm thinking to myself
man you know it's taking so long
i wanted to get it done in a month
you know i was like
yeah you know i'm gonna study for a month and that's it
it's gonna be over and that's it
i don't have to think about it any more
and you know what i've realized
that the things that surround you make you want to like do things faster by not paying as much attention to them
you know or not put as much value to them
you know and i think that's just i think it shouldn't be that way
i think that sometimes you really have to slow down and think about what it is that you have you know and appreciate it
well i don't think that a lot of people can even even think about that stuff
i mean period so
you know what i what i found in the back of a magazine about three three days ago
guess what i found
guess what i found three days ago
um popeye
a d v d collection for popeye
yeah
i know
i know
i know
i was like i looked at it
and i was like
hmm
what
yeah
power rangers was when it first came out was really popular
a popular show
and it's like it's on is gone on like forever
power rangers is still on on the air
it's just in like weird like cable channels
oh
it has to do it has to do with the same thing that i told you about before
because you don't put as much value to it as you used to
that's it
it's been thirty minutes
then get outta here
we're having a conversation
um i think it's for the same reason
yeah
i think if you slow down i think it would be still as important
because it's not it's to be honest with you it is it's not about the presents
it's really more about the feelings that you get and you know like what you want
yeah exactly
you know like that anxiety of like getting up at like twelve a m in the morning to open up your gift
just because you want to see what your parents got you
i used to do that all the time
i remember one time i got some like transformers
and i was like
transformers
and i played with them like over and over
oh the movie
oh really
i didn't know that
your hair looks really nice
so there
and uh you know what
i was gonna tell you
um we went to the worst theatre laughs this weekend
the one in homestead
the absolute worst theatre you can imagine
it's called flagship cinemas
oh my god
oh it's terrible
like we
because the thing is like we wanted to see the forbidden kingdom
and like you know it's basically getting out it's coming out of the theatres now you know
like it's it's leaving theatres
so it was only being shown at uh
what's it called
flagship you know flagship and some theatre in kendall
and so flagship was closer
it was only like seven miles away from my house
so like we decided to go there
so we get there
and like the time that we had seen on the on the on the internet right like the show times and stuff like that was like off by like uh twenty five minutes
so it was like at nine
and the movie started at nine twenty
we were there like at nine forty five
and they're like
oh
you know
the movie's already started
i'm like
what the
the internet yes the show times
and they're like
ah well you know like you can see something else
ok well what show you know like
oh well what happens in vegas you know
so we went to see what happens in vegas
it's like the movie was good
but the theatre was terrible
yeah it was
oh yeah
yeah those people are making so much money
and like the people in comics and stuff like that
and like it's ridiculous
like it's like movie after movie after movie after movie comic book movie after comic book movie after comic book movie like back to back like the hulk ironman uh batman um the dark knight uh
let me see
what are the other ones
and then like some other movies like i can't think of right now
but
handcock is another one
yeah we did
we did
it was ok
it was ok
it wasn't amazing
mal
i know it because his used to his long hair and stuff
normal no
i don't know
let's see hmm
pero cómo así o sea
oh my goodness pero es que son tantas cosas
no
but are you remembering all this stuff
it is like a lot of characters and data
but it's a lot
i hate maths too so
i wouldn't be good at chinese
i'd be better at hebrew
it is like
estaba preguntando o sea
para qué carrizo le sirve a uno ser
ah i'm president
for what
mm
pero yo creo los estudiantes hacen como que
ah i don't care
yeah because i think most of those people are because they don't live here so is like
i've just come here to study that's it
i don't i don't mind
yeah
but in my case probably if i would live here i would care because they can deal with issues and stuff
but i don't know but i don't know if those * people are like doing campaign and getting people to know their their ideas
they are
some times also
exactly
you don't really know why you're voting for
who's that people i just saw
people don't like to read
people don't like to read
ellos prefieren estar así como ver
y que allá está el man parado entonces
yeah
like oh this is a good looking guy oh
oh that one is some nerd
i don't want to vote for him
something like that
like that oh my goodness
but i don't know
i would have to live in here
i want to live in here
yo quiero vivir aquí sí porque es chévere
es super cool
mira vea tengo de todo
tengo my un sitio para cortarme el pelo aquí
tengo el sitio para lavar la ropa aquí
tengo
cafeteria exactly dry cleaning
pero para lavar you get a
no pero para cosas cosas así grandes
pero
para por ejemplo ropa normal así por aquí debe haber un laundry
somewhere
o incluso en los apartamentos
en los dorms they have a laundry room
i think so
i don't know
that'd be cool
you never know
exactly
porque sí por ejemplo si si pues dios te manda para allá
tiene que ser así o sea
es como como hay un yo estaba viendo una una película
de un tipo que él vivía en u k
and he didn't know to speak spanish
y dios le dice lo despierta una noche
y le dice que él tiene que ir a a california
a california
pero que ahí va a haber una familia que habla es una familia mexicana
y entonces dice
uh but i don't know spanish
and he start taking spanish

of what
what is that

all right that's
they pay for your food
oh my god i want something like that but in here
like oh i'm gonna send you to to
i would do that
you know why would i do that
just if i when i just graduate

macedonia

but i'm not in here

no
no we don't need help
probably they think that the president says
oh it's o k
yeah exactly
thirty seven percent it's a lot of people
the caribbean is like not much and here and in latin america are the top ones
but i would go oh my god guatemala
i would go there just for the thing
just for going to to machu picchu and all stuff
machu picchu is in guatemala right
i don't know either
ajá
oh my goodness
macedonia
sí
en su propio momento sí
sí
wow
es que yo el único país que yo conozco de south américa es el mío
eh well a little bit of colombia
colombia yeah because is next to
ah just to cúcuta
and that's it
i like going bogotá
what people tell me
tell me it's cool
i can go there like in five years
and i become a citizen
yeah
you know where i'm gonna go
i wanna go here here here here here
yeah
i know all of that because in my history class we're estamos viendo todo eso
oh my goodness pero es demasiado
como eh eh cuando vimos rome
the roman empire
yo dije quiero ir a roma ya
estábamos viendo también las egipto todos esos
también quiero ir
ahorita estamos viendo es esto mismo
a mexico south america
and stuff
y entonces estamos viendo las ruinas machu picchu tenochtitlán y todo eso de los de los mayan aztecs
sí
o sea yo las veo y yo
wow i wanna go there
i wanna know
i wanna watch
i want experience
quiero experimentar todo eso
pero quiero
all around the world
just para captar por mi vista todo
sí
porque es cool
what
kazakhstan
eso no es de donde era borat
but it is so big that country
here fifty four
no
look
it's huge
it's bigger than colombia
talk like that
morocco
ay morocco is cool
it's just here
next to
you can go to spain
or those countries also
you couldn't travel because if you're helping people there you're can just doing that
because if for example i mean in in the case you're going to morocco si estás ahí tú no puedes decir
no me voy a pasar para españa
sí pero sí sí sí
i mean
si te si estás en marruecos nada más
es para que sirvas en marruecos
porque para eso estás
en españa no está aquí so
you wouldn't need to go to spain
pues no es un
country ah
a españa
i don't think you could because you're volunteer in there
i think you are twenty four seven
yeah but just going for one day
what happens if you're working here
and spain is over there
it's like being in in boston
and you want just go to mexico
and you have only one day off
that's
not possible
mozambique
mozambique
this is madagascar
i know where's madagascar
no philippines
japan is this one
yes it's
it's an island that it's just next to china
and what is this
philippines
rome i wanna go rome o k
experience
well you gotta know the language of the other
wow but this program is long
twenty seven months
that's more than two years
no
i won't do that
yeah
it's only volunteer
well they pay for everything
but
for example if you your career is doing that it's good
but my case wouldn't be
because this this helps you to develop a curriculum
it's not about developing curriculum either
but pero es para ayudar a la gente y todo eso
oh my goodness
estás segura que es una vaca
are you sure it's a cow
it is a no it is a cow
no se la pueden comer
si las matan nada más tienen para el huesito
a ver
let me see
oh my god
ah
what was that
ah
él podía venir
sí
whatever
ya el te dijo
if you've to answer the phone
you can answer it
don't worry
it's just talking
oh look
a butterfly
oh my god
it's huge
hay balones ahí arriba
no sé
yo creo
viste techo que es super cool
ah
um sí y no
o sea it's like
experimentándolo
lo ves
es que de eso se trata architecture
de experimentar todo y verlo
o sea yo yo yo he yo he de verdad que cuando uno estudia eso uno cambia el concepto en como ve todo
uno empieza te empiezas a desarrollar como a develop esas cosas de de ver todo diferente de forma diferente
like the approach you have for everything
tú sabes yo lo veo y como que me inspiro para hacer algo
lo estoy viendo no estoy pendiente del espacio sino que estoy pendiente de la estructura
estoy pendiente de de cómo circula la gente
de la luz
de que es muy oscuro
sí porque de repente ellos querían hacer
hacer algo bastante macizo pero querían mantener el la conexión entre esta parte de college y la otra parte
porque si no hubiese estado este hueco acá las personas hubiesen tenido que dar toda la vuelta alrededor
and that would be like bothersome because
nada this was the only options
pero como la librería is so huge you gotta make a whole to make a a room over there
but it's good also
because
ah i don't know
the building would have to be thinner
but what's good about this it's because is this deep it allows the air go beneath the the building so
so that's why this is so fresh
they did it in that way because this is always like that
aunque haya aunque haya brisa fuera o no haya brisa fuera el aire siempre va a entrar por aquí como
imagínate
it's like pressure
todo el aire está fuera pero se mete por un huequito así
siempre va a fluir
después eso esta parte siempre va a estar refrescada así
pero por ejemplo ellos pudieron haberlo hecho más clara poniendo un piso más claro
en vez de hacer concrete esto con un piso de marble se vería super cool
o en vez de usar pintura gris usar pintura clara
slippery
esa es la cuestión
ah
pero sería el mismo tamaño el edificio pero estás quitándole todo ese hueco para ese corredor
entonces
estás gastando espacio
eso se llama efficiency
that would mean more
esa es pero es que esa es la cuestión
como ayer por ejemplo en la casa en el bookstore al frente a mí me gusta me gustó ese hueco
el huequito donde están los todos los paintings en la en la pared
y es un poco de sillas
se siente así todo como comfortable that
ahí ahí todo
te puedes tirar y eso
pero lo que pasa es que tienes que cuando ya estás en estas cosas en arquitectura y eso tienes que ver que hay mucha mucha cosa más que tienes
claro porque budget
tú diseñas pero tú no eres el que está pagando por el diseño
somebody else
you design it for somebody else
entonces ellos te
ellos más o menos te dicen podemos gastar tanto y
pero tú tienes que limitarte a eso
qué ver un pan con el
yo tengo hambre ahora quiero
quiero comer
me comí unas papitas de jane
jane
jane
pues ahí en el en su casa
ay sí
que le digo
jane ya por favor
cállate
ay pero ay ay
me decía
ay ay connor
pero de gabrielle
oh no
yo papi papi
yo no me esperaba eso
discúlpame y perdona
pero yo dónde quedó dónde quedó
ah ah no no
ella decía
dónde quedó la la cristiandad y y
no papi no
eso no se hace
no no no no no
pues yo le decía
oh my goodness
it's like
why
ella lo que me dijo fue que como tú tenías a un montonón de gente y ya ahí
le estabas tomando fotos entonces que llegó otra persona
esa era una sola persona entonces
no es que venía
morcilla
el de la morcilla fue un poco de negros
dijo
digan morcilla
porque eran cuarenta negros
standard
ah
i know
sí no porque jane jane se
la historia que ella me contó es un poquito diferente
ella le dijo cállese la boca
no yo no creo que jane le haya dicho cállate la boca
ella lo que me dijo ella que estaba hablando contigo
y que vino marta
jane no se qué no se qué
y ella de dijo
marta espérate que estoy hablando con gabrielle
sí pero la entiendo y tal
pero me dio un risa como que no it's too much
para todo lo que tiene que ver con psychology tú no puedes empezar sin masters
en todas las escuelas todos los counsellors
she has the bachelor
pero en todas las escuelas si tú quieres ir de school counsellor you have to have a masters in psychology en en behavioural education or one of these things like that
but it has to be a masters
yeah
but i'm gonna finish school
she's gonna start school
and then i think i'm gonna either go to law school
i have three options right now
and i'm so undecided
i don't know
i'm either gonna do law school my m b a
or i'm gonna do a doctorate in my field because i have the masters done in my field
i did a bachelors in computer sciences and in management information systems which was from the school of business
my master now it's in management is a master of science in management information systems
so es todo tecnología
that's what i did
so puedo seguir en ese camino con dos años más
y sacar el sacar el doctoral
but the problem is they require a residency that you go do research with them
that's the problem
i like it
and that's the thing
if you like something it's easy
no
everything is there
they painted
laid tile
put the baseboards
and put all the muebles
yeah the whole thing ya está puesto
no i closed march third or march fourth
and we had bought everything
so we had all the delivery set up
but i had to get the tile laid
so they finished tile last week
the and then her grandfather painted
her grandfather started painting right after that
and he's almost done
and then we started to installing the furniture friday
friday they started to deliver it
but friday we had a big day like six people did deliveries
so i was like one after the other
y todo el mundo entrando
y colocando
ya
yeah none of the the electronics are in
and we still have to do
we have this guy
i don't know if you've noticed
but there's in my mom's house there's this ceiling
that's all wood
and the guy who made that
he made it from scratch by hand the whole thing
is this brazilian guy that's a woodworker
he and and he's just gifted
that's what he does
se la pasa ahí con cortando cortando cortando
and he does all the stuff
so he's building the closet
and he built
they wanted to charge us like fifteen thousands dollars to do one of these closets that's very modular
and everything's super organized
olvídate like he's doing the closet for peanuts
and he's it's the same
when you gonna see oliver's
oliver's closet
it's awesome
no y es un contrator ya
he's a contractor that has done he did my grandmother stuff
he did my mom's stuff
we just use he use we use him on everything because the guy is super responsible you know like we are
and and he does his stuff
and and he knows his stuff
he got us the tile guy because the tile guy was expensive
pero
they came out perfect
they came out perfect
they came up beautiful they came up beautiful
pero the tile guy you know had to lay the tile like marble
so
they did it in a week
they did it in a week
they did the whole tile in a week
they brought like nine people con las máquinas con los las bolsas de cemento lo que con todo
and right there boom boom con otros tipos marcando otros tipos cortando
and they just went
and they finished it in a week
i couldn't believe it
they laid the tile perfect
perfect perfect perfect
that it's beautiful
but when when you go to the balcony you see that they really looked at it from end to end and they laid everything so in line
you know really really nice very very clean
you know what i mean
tenemos los dos lados
tenemos el mar
adelante
que es el el la vista principal donde están las puertas
entonces el cuarto de ella da al aeropuerto
al lado mirando al oeste
it's awesome
and it's on the twenty seventh floor
so you're like everything's right there
when what we see like if you drew a line straight out it would be the hard rock in bay side
that's like a line straight off from our balcony
because the building is at an angle
so if you say that this is we look like this
ok this is the building
we're on this side
so we look like towards
the other side of the building looks like up the
you know what i mean
like up towards north miami beach
it really is
it's very small
it's very small
very very small
it has two bedrooms
it has like a library like a den which is our office where we're putting the the sofa bed and we're putting the computers and that stuff
and then it has the living room the kitchen the the two bathrooms and the entry way and the balcony
that's it
yeah
it's not a lot of space
it's about thirty hundred and fifty square feets
so when you think about that that's a lot of space
no and we didn't know oliver was coming when we made the commitment
when we put the deposit we didn't know oliver was coming
so we're super happy you know
with her we're fine
just with one more fine
sí seguimos para el segundo
olvídate
estamos jodidos
menos mal que
no no no no no no no
lo que yo creo que como lo estamos preparando lo podemos alquilar por dos mil quinientos
y a lo mejor cargar los restos que serán un poquito más y
and and move or rent in a house or something i guess you know
you figure it out
you always figure it out
el mercado está duro eso sí
ya
la locura de antes
locos
no había razón
a todos
everybody's screwed
it's like musical chairs and who's gonna get stuck without the chair
you know then when the music stop
who's screwed
eso mismo es
eso mismo es qué de cosa
may i
malísimo está la cosa
foreclosure
get outta here
my grandmother sold at a perfect time
the perfect
the perfect time
if she would not have sold that the pressure everybody would be under right now the stress that everybody would be carrying
no thank god thank god he has a great job now
thank god she found her place
and she's all set up
everybody is squared away
because if they woulda stayed with the house holy shit
la gente no entienden con los foreclosures
se va tremendo cantidad de property taxes
que no se lo van a pagar
y todos los servicios van a quedar short cortos de todo
but the city the municipalities are all gonna come up short on their budgets
they're not gonna be able to make it because who's how are they're gonna do it
that's never gonna happen
in the history of man people don't go down not if they can help it
no and in miami two hundred thousand dollars
to know go buy a house
five hundred thousand dollars
you gotta make tremendous money
and oye a house now is five hundred thousand dollars
three hundred thousand dollars now actually you can get a decent house for
pero decent houses or starter house
yeah
they told me
the you know what though
the danger is how much it comes down to
but the fact is if he even comes close to that what you guys have if you guys can get a comp now at that price this neighbourhood is gonna stay great
that's a heck of a selling price
that was a home run
that was a grand slam
oye ganaste ganaste el juego
ese ese es el
that one at bat
olvídate
and that's how it is
that's how it is
look at that
that's
no no no that's a great feeling
that's a great feeling
no way no
men
she's interesting
yeah
she has her days
she has
she's all over the place
you see everything
you see everything
it's like the rainbow
you see everything
she's so amazing though
she's so amazing
if i can do anything in the world right now i would take care of her all the time
that's what i would do
if i had if i had a million dollars
yo
ten more years in my business and i'll be able to step back a lot more
but
yeah
we're at five years
we're at five years
and it's a we did almost two millions dollars in sales last year
and that's of selling labor
of our hours
like we charge a hundred and seventy five an hour more less
and this year we'll probably sell like two and a half millions
yeah it's amazing
we are like at the highest level
of partnership with microsoft
we're microsoft gold manage partners
and they give us a lot of the customers now
and they give us money to do marketing
and they give us money to do events and host things and all sort of stuff
so that's really it
we do a lot of microsoft cisco and two other companies that also are really high in technology
and we do all sorts of customers
we have like thirty car dealerships
we had a lot of real estate customers that have all died
all the developers are almost out of business
we we had seventeen i think we have like two left
yeah
it's incredible
that whole market that whole vertical has just gone
no and and it's not cheap
and and there's not people buying houses and flipping houses and building houses
so even though that it's a great opportunity to make money there it's not there
you're right
it's invisible
sufriendo
ahí es donde cortan
ahí corta
sabes todas las cositas así ahora
y tú vas ahora al periódico y ya esas cosas
y tú ves que hablan de how you cut cost how you're gonna reduce your monthly expenditures where can you save three hundred dollars a month
you know
and they show you how to penny pinch
cositas aquí aquí
yeah you you take you stretch out the cleaning
instead of this and all the stuff
and before you know it you you save three or four hundred dollars a month that if you put into something you are saving money
and saving money is the hardest thing to do
that's the hardest thing to do because there's no extra there is never extra
coño coño trescientos trescientos
yo no salgo de ahí sin gastar trescientos
el periódico el periódico hoy tenía tremendo artículo
the sunday herald today had a big section on how the price of food is going up exponentially
here and around the world because oats and wheat have through the roof
they're
and the other thing that's gone really high is corn because people are now using it to make the gas the ethanol
right
so a lot of people are buying corn so it's creating competition and demand and all these areas that are driving
oye the the people that are general mills that do the oat and the wheats they make all the cereals
like every time their cost goes up like like by a dollar on the on the market the cost of our cereal goes up by a penny
and that'll jump twenty dollars and boom
they have to raise it twenty cents on the cost
the milk
no no no and now everybody is buying organic
so that's like six dollars
they they get you
te clavan
pero tenemos la oportunidad
si lo quieres está ahí
oh bastante más casi el doble por más que el doble con todo los impuestos que hay que poner
pero en europa están haciendo cosas tan interesantes que aquí por toda la complicación de políticos del sistema de mierda que tenemos que es mejor que exista pero mierda
si tú miras a alemania
alemania tiene un programa que le pagan a la gente que pueden producir energía
y y entregar la energía al sistema energético del de la ciudad o de la de la del del condado lo que sea
so la gente ahora están comprando
y poniendo en todas partes en su casa
y el día entero tú vas produciendo
y entregándolo al sistema
ah the grid you're contributing power into the grid
all day
and your and your meter is basically rolling backward and you're getting charged credited
and then at night it uses electricity
right
pero your people in germany know that they passed the law that's good for twenty years that every like kilowatt that you put back is twenty cents or twenty five cents or something fixed
so now farmers are building fields
como tú te das cuenta donde viven los abuelos
y y tenía uno por la finca
tú te acuerdas
los los fields of paint
they look just like that but they're fields of solar panel
and they collect energy all day
right
and they sell that energy back to this grid because the government is the one that has is paying a subsidy
right
for any body
the that wants to do it
and that is saving so much energy energy production that that's less coal less oil less you know natural gas less whatever
y el sol no se acaba
hoy sol hay más que bastante
y más que pasa el tiempo mejor se va a poner la tecnología
y más energía tú vas a poder colectar
so vamos a decir hoy en una pulgada cuadrado tú puedes recoger tal energía cada hora
eso va a seguir subiendo
y en el mismo espacio
tú vas a poder colectar doble diez veces cien veces
no this is crazy
it's crazy yeah
and now you have china and all these other countries that are exploding with growth
and they're where we were fifty years ago
so they're gonna start expending and burning and using so much
that we have to switch
because if not we're gonna get pulled back for them to move forward
there's interesting things that i've i've read about you know how everything
it's a there's a book called it's a flat world that talks about how the whole world is now because of the way technology and everything is we're all in a little village
and what one person does affects the other one
and everybody's gotta realize we have such direct impact
we're not often little islands any more
it's not like that
even if you're you know ninety miles it's nothing
a hundred miles you know a hundred thousands miles you know
it's a
de todo de todo trae de todo
lo que casi te piensan hacen la pensamiento para uno para no tener que hacer nada
mira en mi teléfono yo tengo mi calendario entero que la gente en mi oficina tienen acceso
y todo el mundo maneja poner las cosas en mi calendario cuando hay cita a meeting o lo que sea
yo tengo sincronizado el teléfono con la computadora en la oficina con los servidores que yo pueda accesar de cualquier computadora por el web todos mis contactos todos mis contactos
so i have everybody's information in there
then i have all my email
in my email when you call my cellular phone and you leave a voice mail right it records a computer file that puts that into my email
right and then i listen to all my voice mail on my email
so i sit down once a week or whatever
just grab all my email that are voice mail
and i listen to them
or my faxes
the faxes all come in when you send it you hear the number
it's sounds like a regular fax machine
pero it captures it in the computer
and puts it in my email
and it's a p d f
and then i can look in the faxes
so everything's right there
everything's in my phone
i can look at the p d f on my phone
i can look at the fax on my phone any time
i can listen to the voice mail because the email's on the phone
the email's on the phone
you know how
you use microsoft outlook at work
you know how you have the tasks
like the to do's
those synchronize on my phone
and on my phone i have the tasks synchronized with the computer of the office
so wherever i am it's the tasks
all that stuff as you tie it together it
you know i remember when everybody used to remember all the telephone numbers
right
or you had a little black book o la cosita donde tú le movías para la letra y
salía todo
te acuerdas
todo
but that stuff now is in that little device
but now you look at mary's
the i phone
it has a camera that is full of megapixels
when we went to the island i bought a camera for like a thousand dollars that was great
a sony camera several years ago
tú te acuerdas
the camera in her phone now is better than that one
the camera in her phone it's a higher megapixel and better quality camera than that one was
and it's this big
it's microscopic
it's a speakerphone
it has the the i pod it's in the phone
so she has eight gigabytes of music which is at least a few hundred songs maybe a few thousands songs
no no no i haven't i haven't even started
it has a g p s with a map software
so when you drive it'll tell you where to go
it'll actually talk to you
and tell you
make a left here
make a right here
lo hace todo el teléfono
you can go buy stock
they sell stock on the phone
through the same thing that is a mary trader or any of these places where you do it from your computer
the internet on the telephone is so incredible
tú te imaginas que tú miras un teléfono telefonito así
y tú no ves nada
es tan pequeño
so they develop the technology that ah
i'll have to show you this on the phone
then when you look at the web page tú coges tus dedos
y si tú lo observaras así it zooms you in
and if you do this it zooms you out
and you can move around the page
so you zoom in
and if you touch like the link like on the internet if you touch the hyperlink te entra
pero todo es con tu dedo
it's incredible
it's so natural
to use it's so easy
like it's intuitive
and that's what makes apple different
all of the apple products are very natural
they're very intuitive
they
i'm a microsoft company
i know what microsoft does
it's great for business
but for just being easy to use and enjoyable man the apple stuff
tú coges el teléfono de allá cuando tú estabas oyendo la música
tú lo pones al lado
y te cambia
sabe que tú lo pusiste al lado
ahí te abre todos los albums
y todos los covers de todos los albums
y tú le das así
y te va cambiando las páginas al mirar todos los albums
tú tocas el cover del álbum que tú quieres
y lo haces al revés
y tú ves la lista de todas las canciones
tocas la canción
y te lo toca y te lo te lo
te lo tengo que enseñar
it's amazing it's amazing
pero that's where everything is going like
it's amazing
tú sabes ahora
tú usas google
te vas a google tú
type una palabra
y te lo lleva
ahora hay algo que está en lo que es beta
beta es como un testing
que ha salido al público
es que creo que quedan como novecientos oportunidades para beta testers
se llama searchme dot com
que es igualito al google
pero hace algo muy diferente
cuando tú pones los las palabras
y tú haces search
en vez de entregártelo en una lista de palabras
te do la te lo te lo da en previews of the website
so you actually see the website
and then you hit to the the arrow on the keyboard
y te lo lleva al próximo website
the next arrow boom al próximo website
the next arrow boom al próximo website
so you can see everything like if you were flipping through a catalogue you're seeing already the front of the web page
so when you're looking for something if you can see the visuals
oh that's exactly what i'm looking for boom and you're there
so instead of presenting it to you in a word list of all of the blue links with all the words and all that stuff it's giving you the website
but on the bottom if you still wanna see the words you press button
y te abren todas las palabras at the bottom
and you can scroll through the box on the bottom
it's searchme dot com and it's really really good
yeah they're testing they're testing
and it's an interesting engine
that's the question
is will the engine of what they bring back when you type a word in be as advanced in the algorithm as google is
if it is then you have something really unique
because that's what it's a visual component with a very powerful search engine
google is a very powerful search engine
it gives you good returns like when you put something in it gets close to what you're looking for
it is a good process
and think about it
their software google
it's a software
that it's a giant company right
hundreds of billions of dollars
but their software scans the entire internet
everyday
no they're trying to buy yahoo
who's google'seng biggest competitor
but the yahoo owners the board of directors that runs the company says it's too little money
they offered forty two billion
they said it's too little
they said no for forty two billion
yeah laugh
you're talking about a company that didn't exist ten years ago
and then forty two billion's too little
yeah i know know and
microsoft'seng good
microsoft knows how to win
and specially when microsoft'seng coming in second place they know how to jump and beat the guy in first place
they're not very good at being in the first place from the beginning
apple is very good at being in first place at the beginning
apple is really really interesting
yeah yeah yeah
no no no y
el costo de la capacidad para procesar sigue bajando
so hoy en día tú compras una computadora
que tú te acuerdas la computadora que nosotros teníamos en el cuartico en la casa vieja
tú estás hablando hoy de una computadora que tiene mil veces la potencia
that those computers used to be able to process like twelve million instructions per second right
these are gigahertz computers
these can do like four billion instructions per second
and when anything can calculate that fast
you know
i can't think what it can calculate
you know
para qué
para mi papá
oh my god
i know i know
es que
tú crees que es mejor comprarle un laptop
pero yo tengo
yo tengo tremendo tremendo conexión para arreglar eso
so yo se lo pedí
yo yo lo llevé el mío a arreglar al mismo lugar la semana pasada
y me lo arreglaron ahí mismo
cuando fuimos al camping mary estaba moviendo la maleta atrás en el carro para sacar el coche
y el laptop se se cayó de la maleta en el piso
tremendo it was banged up
so i took it over there
and they fixed it right away
and they are people that i'm doing business with too
and they're they're a toshiba repair shop
and they fix like
they're one of the only laptop repair shops in all of miami
and they have i b m like
yeah
we'll take it over there
and get that fixed because the problem with my dad is that buying a new computer for him is is crazy because he's not gonna use
he does very very simple things
and yeah my dad is doing very simple things
some picture thing
you know stuff like that
it's not a
no hay necesidad para para él meterle con

what else
what else what else what else
no it's more than what he needs
it's more than what he needs absolutely
eso es típico
eso es típico
yeah the power port on the on the motherboard's coming loose more than anything because that particular port takes a lot of abuse takes a lot of abuse
so
no
she's out
she's out
and then i think on thursday she goes to arizona
so
she's travelling
she travels a lot
last time she came back so sick
ah just with tremendous flu that she got down there
and just really really sick
and that's the thing
when you're out there there's no medicine
it's not like being here
you know
it's not like being here
it's different
you got to get back here
oye laughing it's the best there is
nobody has to pretend laughing
this is the best there is
it's it's it's a disaster
but it's still still pretty amazing
oh my god
we're gonna have a black president
and not only that we're gonna have a a total change in everything
taxes are gonna go up like crazy
oh my god taxes are gonna go up so much
it's gonna get insane
yeah
you have to pay for everything
they wanna give everybody your money laughing
recogerte vaya
ok if you're disabled
if you're cripple
you know
that's insane
no y barack barack es tremendo demócrata
escondida
y él escondido
él es un político como cualquier
él es igualito laughing
eso del del momento que empezó ha ha estado ahí la la lucecita roja
no no no no
no no no no no olvídate
que ponga a hillary de vicepresidente
entonces nadie porque nadie quiere a ella laughing
ella es peor todavía
nadie lo mata porque peor quedarse con ella laughing
no no no no she's a shark
she's a shark
oh my gosh
she's the one that knows what she's doing
he was just there for the ride
and he's just a great talker
man he's charismatic
he's very charismatic
and he's a natural speaker
and he's got a gift to connect with people
but he's a tremendous party animal
and a bullshitter
and he's someone that
he's a politician when whenever he had to make a decision he'd look around and then he'd say
no if you do that they're gonna kick your ass if you do that
so he just did whatever the easy thing was
but sometimes you gotta do some fucked up shit
mira
nosotros cagamos somalia cuando era presidente
entramos ahí
después de eso en kenya creo que es los tutsis y los hulis mataron ocho mil ocho cientos mil personas en como cuarenta días
algo así
era como veinte mil personas al día
que estaban matando
y el otro no hizo nada
y todo el mundo sabía qué estaba pasando
y le dejaron
mira estaba pasando
y ellos estaban diciendo
mira si hacemos algo los republicanos nos van a crucificar
estaba ocupado
el otro está
you know what he does know what he's doing
and he's a smart politician
he knows how to work everybody
and that's it
you want somebody that can work the whole field the left the right the middle everybody
he's a true politician you know
and he understands if he just says everything right there out there you know his bus is called the straight talk express
because that's what he says
when i talk to you it's straight talk
i'm talking to you straight
there's nothing hidden over here
there's none of that
i'm telling you what i think
you might like it
you might not
you might hit me
but that's what i think
the other ones are like you know i'll think this if you want me to think that
i'll think this if you want me to think that
con todo el mundo
of course not
como ellos
estaban en ohio
donde mucha gente han perdido sus trabajos razón de nafta
porque that just happened to me manufacturing state
so they all go ohio and the say
we're gonna get rid of nafta
and then they go up to canada
and they say
hey don't worry we're not gonna mess with nafta
we love nafta
but in this day you know whatever
and then the canadian government leaked leaked to the media that that was happening
ah bueno pero fin de semana so you can take your time
that's good
sí porque tú eres bien organizado
yeah you are
ah no sé todavía de lo que espera que contraten a más personas en el to go
well i have to train them
so
yeah
so
hasta ahora no se han contratado a nadie
pero cuando los um contraten me toca entrenarlos
and we have to see if they get good at it
they're actually trying to like succeed in the job
y ya después me imagino que un mes o algo
ya me puedo mover el server
pero por ahora estoy en el to go
so yeah
huh
well i don't know
they haven't hired anybody yet
so i'm just waiting
no you have to be eighteen to work in chili'seng
yeah
no it doesn't
because if you do it with kids you have to work around their school hours
and
maybe
well yeah maybe we get people in the summer
but for now we don't have anybody
and they don't hire under sixteen
and if they were to hire
uh under eighteen
but if they hired someone like sixteen they can only work certain amount of hours
and they can't work before six
they can't work after eleven
so i don't know if they're gonna hire younger kids in the summer
but i think they're not supposed to
i think the law says that we're not supposed to
well because
i know but the only job they give you is to bag groceries which is not hard
so i think
yeah but that's not hard
no it's not
y um el jueves i have um a trainer meeting
a meeting where trainers go
and we talk about progress
and
no it doesn't
because no te acuerdas
the first time we went to we went to like dave and busters i think
and then the second time
we went to maggianos
we did
and then they gave us food
and now we're going to dave and busters again
yeah on thursday
a lot
like twenty
o es que hay como there's like about four or five cooks that are trainers
there's
there's like in to goseng there's only two
but i think that i'm the only one that's going
and servers there's like ten servers
ten about ten servers that are
trainers
train
show other people how the job works
very funny
because they see that i'm the one that has that knows how to do it
that knows the job better than others
that can explain it to others
yeah
so that's an advantage
pero
it's good to be a trainer
because you help you're helping your workplace by showing new people
get it
that's the whole point
so yeah i have a meeting that day
uh bien
on monday i have a midterm of art appreciation that class
i have i only have for that class
i don't have a midterm for english
yeah i have finals
i have to take an exit exam in in english class
like in order to pass it i have to pass the class and i have to pass that that exam to go on to english um eleven o one yeah
no
yeah so that
and uh in math not doing to well yeah
got third
it's not seventh grade
well i'm not doing bad
it's just i struggle with some parts of the math
but it's not really hard
no
that's the easy part
it's like the problems
you know like the ones where it says if this this object has a height of this and it has a uh width of this so what is the area or something like that
well it confuses me
so i had kinda struggled on the problem ones
english part of the math
ok
yeah so uh i think i have like a b or a c in that class right now
but hopefully i can get my grades up
yeah because apparently everybody says that in architecture there's a lot of math
yeah so i don't think i'll have problems
that's just people over exaggerate
i think
we'll see
i don't think i have that much math
but i don't know
it depends when i transfer
no huh
probably hopefully next year
if i
well i don't think so
but like maybe end of next year i'll finish in b c c
and then i'll start the winter in f i u if possible
but we'll see
yeah
so cómo estás con las novias
qué laughs
uh yeah
ok you don't have to
you don't have to tell me if you like anybody
you just have to tell me que como te va
bien te va bien laughs
funny
oh
yeah so is there any movie you wanna see that's coming up
no
no
it wasn't in theatres when i went the other day
i didn't see it
yeah
i wanna see one that's called stop loss
it's a movie about these um guys that are in the that are in the army
and so they were in iraq for i dunno i guess couple years or months or something
and then they come back to texas
because that's where they're from i guess
and so they're ready to get out of the army
and because they did their duty and everything
and then the army says that they're going back
because they don't
yeah
they don't have enough people to fight the war over there
so they're sending them back
so that's what i think stop loss means
and so like it's a battle deciding if they're going to do it or not
and it looks pretty cool
plus it has cute guys in it
so yeah
that's a plus
so we'll see if hmm yeah
we'll see if i go see that movie
if we go see that movie because it looks cool
ok maybe not with you
but maybe i'll go see it or something
ah nada más
nothing new here
i applied for a credit card
i applied for a credit card
no credit cards
debit card is like they pay it out of your they take the money out of your bank account
and credit is that ah you have to pay for everything
you get a bill of the things you paid with your credit card
and then you have to pay them off
so
well
well it really depends
like i think it depends on what you're paying
because if it's a large sum and they take it out of your bank account and then you have other stuff to pay then you're gonna be short in money
so if you do credit card they give you a certain time for you to pay them off
so you don't have to you know pay them on the spot
so yeah
y qué pasó con adrian
te siguen hablando o no
but he doesn't hang out with you guys
so you guys aren't friends any more
what about david
who's gonna be who's gonna be your best friend when sam leaves
so tu colegio it's just a middle school or is it middle school and high school like in the same building
so
oh it's over there by the library
so tu colegio hasta qué grado va
no pero the building like to what grade does it go to
eighth grade y después te vas a pasar allá a sheridan
hmm
which is where you are
so um what classes do you think you're gonna take next year
so what are you gonna do
don't say p e
you don't even like it
you say it tires you too much
what other elective is there
what other elective is there
so you wouldn't take art class just because you don't like the teacher
do you even know the teacher
it's the same one for every elective
well i think you should take that class
i think art is better
because
no
because you said you didn't even like it
so does everybody have to take p e or
well how come um marissa took p e
does she like it
so why'd she take it
pretended then
pretended
how can you feint five times
four seventeen
i go to work at five thirty today
i'm gonna do q a
didn't i already explain it to you
q a means quality and assertion i think or accuracy
yeah
i have to
i have to um
hold on
give me my phone thank you
um i have to like put them the the food like on trays
and like uh check them to see if they're accurate how the people ordered it
and then send it to the tables
but have to do it like every ticket has to be under fifteen
and has to be cooked properly the way they want it with dressings they ask for it
if the people didn't like how it was cooked or how it was made or if it was missing something they just send it back
and we'll fix it for them
and meanwhile manager goes and talks to them
and tells them
oh we'll fix it for you
and like apologizes
and makes sure that the customer is satisfied
so yeah
that it it's way fun that to gos
to go i don't wanna do to go any more
so i get i would get tips as server
i would get triple
what to get on a friday night
well i get paid more in q a
so
yeah
i get paid eight for to go
and i get paid ten for q a
like thirty five maybe
if it's a good night
if it's a good night around thirty five dollars
but not always
it's not consistent
huh
maybe
but i don't always do q a
i asked yesterday
i went in at four
but i had to work at six
so i didn't know
i thought it was at four o'clock
so i was two hours early
so i was like
well i didn't know
i didn't know it was uh until six
so yesterday i um did a starbucks run
i went to go get coffee for everybody
and then when i came back i started helping out one of the managers
and i was doing prep work which is like you know making the sauces and cooking the meat and cutting it up into pieces and stuff like that
yeah
but managers do that too
so i started helping him
and then i started to ask him questions about how much they get paid and stuff
and he says they get paid like like a thousand like eleven hundred around there um every two weeks
so i mean for my age that's not bad
if i can get a manager position
they could start training me
and then eventually just tell corporate that they're training me
well no
i mean if they really train me as manager i'm probably not gonna stay at that store
because they're always moving the managers to other to other restaurants
i mean to other stores of chili's
they call them stores instead of restaurants
because they're all restaurants
but they're different place
they're they're located different places
so they could move me which is not what i really want
but if they're paying
ok well if if they're paying i mean for that amount it doesn't sound bad to me
so i mine as well take the opportunity if they offer
i don't know
it's not up to me or them
it's up to the corporate um place
so
it's like where they decide things about chili's like the stuff on the menu like uh
i don't know
stuff they wanna change in each store
stuff like that
i don't know
yeah so i don't know
we'll see
but or or i might actually quit chili's
i was talking to your mom the other day
i might like look for a job at um
ah what's it called
yeah b c c
like there's this department called
there's this department called something department of visual arts and something else
and uh i might see if they have anything over there
so we'll see
i don't know
but you know
we'll see
yeah i met get a job there or i was thinking maybe in the summer to work less or
because um
no
i wanna work less because i wanna get into dance
i wanna do i wanna get into dance classes
i don't care what you think
it's not up to you
it's up to me
no like modern
like modern
like hip hopish popish
i don't know
something will come up
but i have to see
i think i get the other day i saw like there's a place in silver lakes
but i don't know
it looked like for young kids
so i don't know
i have to look for a place where where to go
but maybe we'll see
no it wouldn't
but but then i'm gonna take two classes in the summer
i'm gonna take reading and english
so
i wanna focus on class and dancing not so much on work
because i'm working forty hours right now
i don't i don't need to work that much
i mean i don't hardly pay anything
so i want my summer like to relax
and to do something knew
get it
y tú no te vas a meter en nada
you wanna do deporte
why don't you play baseball
you don't like it
no you don't
no you don't
who told you that lie
no you don't
no you don't
you can catch up
yes you can
you can play anything you want if you put your mind to it
seriously
but uh let's see
you you already played soccer
apparently you sucked at it
baseball you're not even considering it
football they'd kill you in the field
basketball i don't know
i don't even
yeah i don't even think you're you're the type of kid that's like for sports
no offence
but yeah i think you're more artistic person
i think you should pursue something like music
or art
something like that
because i don't see you i don't really see you playing sports
sorry
yeah
it's up to you though
i mean you could play golf
but uh i don't think so either
what else
ah
pingpong's a sport
you could play that
well ok if you get into sport it involves you actually training and practicing
and you're not really that type of person
because based on experience i've seen that you want to do something
but you don't want to like practice
you don't like to
practice and see if you're in
you're not you don't really try to get better
like you expect
you expect to learn something
and that's that
like piano lessons when you took that
yeah but i mean you could go back to it now
and it'd be the same for you
you don't want you don't practice
you don't anything
and like
i don't know
it's just you're not
it's not boring
just it's not probably not your thing
but it's up to you
so whatever you want

i'm excited because i haven't been on vacation since like i went to go see my dad which that was like two thousand one two thousand two i think
so i'm excited about going to the airport and stuff because i love the airport
and i've never been to a wedding before
never been to a wedding
so i'm excited to see what it's like you know
yeah
so i'm excited about that
but i'm nervous because like oh my god
i don't know twenty people and stuff so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah the school's really big
yes
my school i i kinda get lost sometimes in the school to be honest
because i don't really do too much
go to class
and sometimes i stay like you know like just relax and look around
when i when i'm when i'm not in a hurry to get home
that's exactly it
i'm i'm not in a hurry
i'm never in a hurry to get home
i thought i don't think i'm ever home
that's the thing
i think i only to go like sleep
yeah
i know
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
god
that's something really like oh my god like
so already have like your bachelors
like i i wish i could already be there like
i feel like school is like i like
yeah
yeah
it was funny
last night i was talking to maria for awhile
and like
she like she was we were just talking about it like man
i was telling her the same thing i'm telling you like that i feel like i just started college
and like oh my god like three more years
and like not even because i haven't finished my first year yet
and then she's like
well you know think about like this like
she said that like
and it's the same it's the same thing i was thinking
like in high school like when you were a freshman you were thinking the same thing
you were just
oh my god four years of high school
it's gonna take forever
and like now it's like you think about it
and like man it's already been a year that i'm out of high school
you know and it's like now you wish you could go back
you know
so it's like
i mean even though high school's very different from college
but either way you know
what it is about high school that i
that's a very easy question ok
you don't have
in high school like everything was easy for everybody mostly everybody ok you
you didn't have you had responsibilities
but not as big as the ones we have
and ok i'm i'm gonna be honest with you
in high school i barely remember it
^ like i think the most times that i ever like opened a book was like three times
to study
you know
and then in college i've had to learn like your your grade is based on tests
you know if you don't open that book and read you're gonna fail
you know
so it's like so then like i guess like in college now i'm kind of trying to like redeem myself for high school
because i didn't do good in high school like
i was an average student
i i had like a what
i graduated with like a two point like
six or something a two point seven like
yeah
but
yeah
but i guess in a way like in college i'm trying to do my best that i can
you know and then i realize i'm like
because i never thought like i would look at those like like smart kids and stuff
and it's like nah
and like i wish i could go back
and like get like bright futures and all that crazy stuff and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's true
oh my god you see that's something i don't want
i don't wanna be alone
yeah
my god
that's why i try to think about that sometimes
like man i hope i'm choosing like the right career
and like
i'm trying to learn like one thing i'm trying to change about myself now is like
because like you're though like these last couple of months man like it's been hitting me hard like
like like now i'm trying to like realize like man like
i used to be so happy all the time you know
and then like there like they used to be like like this these last couple of months i'm like oh my god
and you know like i was thinking that this isn't me you know like
i didn't i used to care but like not where i made it like
the centre of my life you know like
yeah
yeah
but i don't know
like i'm i'm i'm good now
i'm not
yeah i know
yeah
it's true
what
you think
yeah
really
i don't even think like five minutes like i
i hate it
like oh my god
like
i dunno
that's one thing about me like that's like really like oh my god
i hate being alone
like i hate being alone
i don't like being alone
if i'm in my house and i'm like oh my god like there's nothing to do nobody here like i'm leaving
you know like i would run
i'm just gonna go for a drive or something and like laughs blast my music
i dunno it's like you know
no like people literally yell at me all the time
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's true
but i don't think i don't think that a lot of people have that mentality
yeah
what
no way
really
ah
oh i haven't seen popeye in forever
that used to be one of my favorite shows
aw that's so cool
oh my god do you know what i used to watch a lot too
i used to watch the power rangers
and the ninja turtles laughs
yeah
aw i miss all those things
yeah but
yeah but i don't think it would be the same as
or i don't know if it's
like ok because you like the other day
not the other day
but like like i would start like
once like when i was in high school and i was like a freshman i was like man like
now like you know you see like christmas and all those things
yeah and like man the holidays the holidays any more
do you think it's because you view it differently because you're older now
like
oh yeah
really
yeah
so maybe it does have a little bit to do with people growing
christmas spirit
yeah
i used to love christmas
yeah
oh my god
you know um they started working on transformers two like
yeah like the first of june
yeah
yeah they started working on it
because i was watching the the

we tried to go there one time
but i never got to go inside inside
it is really
why did you end up going there
oh ok
uh huh
yeah
yeah
right
what's the matter
really
oh so yeah what i was telling you
i'm surprised i didn't forget
um the guy one of the guys that were from the transformers the first one
i don't know who he was
i don't know his name
um he went up there
and he was like
oh so much
and then he's like
oh we just started filming
he goes
actually tomorrow we're gonna start filming transformers two
i was like
oh my god there's gonna be a transformers two
that's so cool
did you did you guys end up seeing indiana jones
really was it good
la gente fuma
you were working with me laugh
i know pero laura laura
ahah
laura cuando pasa parece el el el estómago se le está cayendo
because her shirt never covers her stomach brother
is so annoying
yeah
yeah
yeah but i need more
is that your teacher
se va
bye
ay let's go there
because the reason that this is here is because of the grass
yeah
don't drop it
entonces is working now
because if we are around grass it's gonna be mosquitoes
she told me she ella lo dijo que si se si se vacía una mesa que podemos ir para allá
el lío es no sentarnos en la misma mesa
it's another
hmm
no
anyway
i think
turn let's just turn around
gives her back give her back
emilio
complicated
mira para esto
los mosquitos nos están siguiendo
yeah i know
but who cares
mosquitoes
ok
i know
not not him
ok
peter
annie
uh annie today was talking to peter
yeah
yeah
i don't know how selena always always governs laura
she wants yeah she went to selena
y she she tells me
dile a laura dile a selena que vaya a almorzar
yeah so i called her
selena was eating right
and then she got out of the lunch
and she was like
y ahora que que selena coma
dile que venga a comer
like como si fuera una madre
i don't know man
she i i don't like that lady
that lady like she is always like
she's always bossing
selena
que se puede hacer en cinco minutos
mientras que no sea ella la que resolvió el problema
iria told you
revisa esto
no resuelve esto no revisa revise
right
oh yeah no you can't talk to her if you don't have patience
selena
you're good already
ah
ay
of course
and not even that
i'm not gonna look
no le digas que estás conmigo que quiere venir para acá
yeah but every time
siempre me pasa lo mismo
if i give something if i
and everytime i give
clara something
she is always like
ah ok ok ya lo escribo aquí ya lo escribo aquí
thank you ella
ay estoy ahogada
a hablar
y te preocupa por sus problemas
tengo que hacer eso
él él no trabaja
for those patients
i get she likes things her way
and se hunde se hunde en un vaso de agua si if if it's not her way
she has to learn how to treat people because like everybody everybody after i hear selena scream they come out through through the
ah
oh yeah
yeah the law lady
so marta and maria have been at it
el gato and maria have been at it
martin and maria have been at it
everybody has been at it with maria because she just doesn't know how to handle situations
oh yeah maria and i had never been at it because from the beginning i knew that with that lady you have to have a little bit more than paciencia than everybody else
i think she just never learned people skills
yeah because when somebody cuando
exactly tú tienes que convivir con la misma gente so why would you get in a fight with them or whatever
and it's not that
remember when annie was her asistente
er
um
who cares
no mosquitoes
oh you you wanna go to
oh no because the teacher said that she had to see us to come in and see
and there's nobody in the class
let's go in the class then
um
tú te acuerdas when annie was maria'seng case manager assistant
that maria was screaming every five seconds
yeah pero now she doesn't scream as much because she's talking to jose
she knows que se tiene que aguantar la lengua because jose'seng a grown man
do you get me
but it's not even
it's beyond that
it's beyond the fact that like
look in this way
it's beyond the fact that like it's like
exactly like you have to learn it because
and it's not even that
regardless it's like if si yo fuera annie i would look at her and be like
tú crees que me puedas hablar a mí como si fuera persona please
honestly
i know like we're getting bitten
oh ok
thank you
yeah
no that when annie was her her assistant her case manager que maria every five minutes
ay marie
she always screams
and it's just like you have to learn how to talk to people
and you have to learn how to defend yourself as well
because if i was in marie'seng shoes i would look at her
if i was in marie'seng shoes i would look at her and be like
maria tú crees que tú me puedas hablar a mí como una persona por favor
no tiene que gritarme
exactly
like the one time that maria has
you've never heard maria scream at me
and the one time that maria screamed at me was porque she was trying to to printear un order
y yo estaba faxeando
so she's like
so she was like ay
ay yo tengo que printear
and i was like
sí sí esperate un momentito
déjame mandar este fax
yeah and then she was like
no no no no no no
and i'm like
maria
i know
i looked at her
and i was like
maria
no no no no
i was like
maria tú sabes que yo te entiendo más cuando tú me estás hablando
cuando tú me gritas no sé qué me pasa en la mente que te bloqueo completamente
yeah
no that she was just like
bueno que cuando termine
i know
i'm allergic to mosquitoes
i'm gonna have grey manchas all over myself right now
and then that's it
and you've never ever ever heard maria screaming
este mosquito
quiere ser mi hermano
go for your shirt
i know i have one here now
i have one everywhere see
soy alérgica
in cuba it was really bad
when i used to live in cuba when i was a little girl
ronchas all over all over all over my legs
yeah
yeah i had a mosquitero in my bedroom
yeah
i wanted to walk around the mosquitero twenty four seven
yeah nights in cuba are hot
unless unless you open a window
and you let more mosquitoes come in
but you still get air
not really
not really
i don't i don't
no it doesn't
it doesn't because it has holes
the air goes through
i'm sure the ventilation is not as fast but
i wanna go to cuba
i have to tell you one thing
the people the conversation
and my whole family is there
la comida
ya pero nadie cocina como mis abuelas
nobody nobody nobody in this earth has been able to compare to my abuela
especially
my mom's mom she used to cook the best harina
no but you would have liked hers
but you would like
grits

oh my god a mosquito bit me on my scar
i can't scratch it
dónde va esto

ya lo maté
and that's it
you can have
you can put milk azúcar
and drink it
it's the same thing
but
yeah with a spoon with a spoon
yeah
i'm the same drink because i swap the milk
because i like to slurp the milk
she cooked
and you guys had
oh that's why
and the and the
no i haven't tried it
doesn't like my harina
yeah
it's just i've i grew up with that
and and you know
like that's what i ate
that's why i like it
i like it
i like it a lot
and in fact my mom hasn't made it in tres meses
that's why you like it because you can put sugar in it laughing
no but mine you can eat it
mine you can put sugar
you could spread sugar on the top or milk
oh
i hate cinnamon
there's a mosquito right by your head
game plan
oh
oh yeah
yeah the lisp
like he was talking about the like almost a lisp
i have to see that movie actually
it's in blockbusters
give it to me
and i'll return it
the one by porkys
oh no coral way
i'll tell them it's a return
why
no
no
don't call him
the only reason you wanna call him is because
the that he that
qué
what
oh that
entonces tú le vas a decir
yo oí que esto esto esto y esto
and now i'm mad at you
why are you gonna present that to him
why are you gonna present that to him
don't start a fight again
and don't let his last memories of you be fighting
too late
yeah but still like
leave it as a mature breakup that you are just like forget it forget it forget it
and that's it
nada de
because then that's all i'm gonna remember
oh my god my ex girlfriend
like that
really
qué quería saber laughing
huh how you doing
hey what's up
oh what a surprise
because he just had the same text message
and he just duplicates
and sends it to you
i can't sleep talk to me
so puede ser el televisor de patty
i know
me a lo patty estaba durmiendo
patty estaba durmiéndose
se se despertó
creo que cuando tú estabas dormida que él se despierta y llama a patty
ahora está haciendo al revés
mosquitos
fall fall fall
yeah because my next operation is in may so
june and july
do you know how
do you have enough recovery time
or something like that
healed
yeah that's what it is
yeah because may
june july
ok
august is when when fall term starts
so i have june and july
pretty much how january
i'm not gonna be willing because i have my operation in in january
and by late february i was walking fine
do you get me
so
no it's just kind of late august
yeah
i can't wait man
i wanna wear high heels
quiero bailar
neat boots fast cheap end of all
everyone's boots dot com
eso fue en miami dade también
how much does a term in f i u cost you
how many classes do you take
yeah
i don't have that fee yet
i don't have that fee
well for me it's a thousand flat
everything for five classes was a thousand flat
and that's five classes
that's what i paid last year
it's a thousand flat
nine hundred and ninety nine dollars and like seventy six cents or something like that
yeah
i paid that out of my pocket
i had a i had a savings account
i paid for my for my miami dade term half of my car
and that's it
and then my mom paid the other half of the car
and that's it
and my dad didn't help with squat laughing
that's how it is
i think so
well
but that's what i'm saying
por qué tú no fuiste al miami dade two years before coming here
i'm gonna do my i'm gonna
practically like saving money
oh that's true
that's true
i'm gonna have to come to this school
the school
the school parece a little bit more confusing than miami dade
i know i'll get the hang of it because when i first saw miami dade i was
oh my god this is so confusing
jail
no
this class is ugly compared to the classes i had in miami dade
only outside
bueno
so the reason i like miami dade es porque
ah i'm a mí no me importa eso
huh i don't look at it
and and miami dade has like
miami dade has like arts stuff too
pero what i like is on the side of the building has a really big four or three or two
it's one of those where where ever you need to go
exactly
well it's building four like lets say four two zero five
it's building four second floor fifth room
that's the way it's split up
so para mí que yo soy un poquito ah retrasada
em that's easy
porque if it's building four entonces eh parking here
building three and parking here
and in between each building parking there's a little parking in cases there's not space
and
i always find space close to my class
no no no for me is leaving in like lo que tenía que esperar era cinco minutos
and somebody left
somebody always left
and all i have to do
ah i know
this is a chemistry and physics building with an an english class inside of it
so listen so if you give
ok
ok look tus gastos doscientos cincuenta dollars down
right and then you just pay whatever you can every month because it's not until september the cruise
yeah
whatever you can give fifty dollars or so
whatever it's you have until the time of the cruise to pay
ok
the everything is refundable up to sixty days before the cruise
you have up to sixty days before the cruise to decide whether or not you want your money back
no you dumb ass
it's three beds
it's a bunk bed and one bed
yeah it's three beds
betty and john have a big king size bed
whatever laugh
did you see did you see the the itinerary
the schedule thing
yeah
cozumel
it's gonna be a lot of fun
no i've been there
i told you i've been there
it's cozumel
jamaica

i think so
you should
it's a lot of fun
i've been to all of them
didn't we already get our income tax

all you have to do is give two hundred and fifty dollars down

jack pero para tú sabes
para empezar
right
well
pero
por ahí se se aparece otro
bueno una cama de litera
sí mijo sí
siempre siempre aparece una opción que uno pueda hacer
no ahora ahora la situación no está ni para vender ni para comprar ni
porque lo que pasa es que si compras
pero después cuando vienen lo todo todo lo que se pega
es que aquí se volvieron locos jack
entonces los bancos los bancos entonces le daban préstamo a gente que no calificaban
porque no ganaban lo suficiente para poder pagar ese
tú sabes y entonces ahora un embarque que todo el mundo está
quién se queda afuera
a ver quién se queda afuera laugh

yo te voy a decir que esto la situación nada nada buena
por eso tú sabes uno tiene que tratar de gastar lo menos posible

quién lo va a pagar
los bancos están imagínate
que empiecen a a bajar los sueldos a a toda esa gente que ganan bastante dinero
ah bueno pues entonces
bueno pero tú sabes
toda esta gente que tienen ahí en lo los directores de esto de aquello todo gente del condado todos ganan doscientos mil pesos al año
tú sabes
entonces eso es un dinero que

sí señor
entonces ahora vienen las elecciones jack
sí porque los los demócratas dicen que son del pueblo

por qué aquí tiene que existir un welfare para mantener a la gente
un welfare es para ayudarte a encaminarte esto un año o dos años
dale
ponte a trabajar
por qué tengo yo que mantenerte a ti

entonces las mujeres éstas pariendo
tienen todos los años tienen un hijo
no tienen marido
yo no sé los hijos cómo los hacen
entonces
hay que mantenerle el muchacho
mientras más hijos tienen más dinero le dan
no trabajan

los demócratas son los responsables de eso
porque yo entiendo que a una persona hay que ayudarla
ese es un tremendo come mierda
y ese lo que trae es una agenda muy oscura muy escondida oíste

but lately they've been like out there pushing it hard
like a million people wanna give you a flyer and food
yeah
people usually hicieron que like when i was eating lunch
i was eating in subway and then
subway with the cup laugh
yeah laugh
um i was eating food and the girl in front of me was saying like
oh i was at the library those people were bothering me
and telling me but i don't care about that i really don't care about this place
so like she is kind of like shows the typical attitude of like
people not want it to go
yeah
i think most students would be more involved if they had more time
but they have a full schedule
they have they may have a job
and then they have to study
so they're like
i don't
that's wasting my time
they don't stop to like find out about who's president cause they're too busy
and i understand them cause that happens to me
yeah yeah
but only through flyers like they just show you their flyers and talk to
they're not doing like a whole campaign like an official campaign
yeah
but it's kind of funny
it's interesting
ajá
yeah
who is like looks the nicest like oh
yeah
or like this person gave me cupcakes
i'll vote for her
but look
but i think it's funny because it represents like how the nation is
like people don't sit down and
listen to our campaign
they just look at the flyers and like
oh i've i want to vote for a man
or i want to vote for a woman or a black man like green alec
oh a black man as a president would be awesome
but they're going by the image or like a woman as a president
but like it's a big issue anyway
eh

ah tus pero tú haces dry tu haces dry clean para toda la ropa

y todos los estudiantes estaban corriendo

y un había un círculo donde estaban alrededor de edificios
y adentro ahí estaba jugando soccer

i mean not english
they teach you the the country the language of the country you're going to for two years and the
yeah it's twenty seven months you have to volunteer
yeah
sí un it's a long time right
yeah
but it's like you don't have you don't get a saving
it's like
mira esa vaca flaca
hasta la vaca está
sí
or a horse
it's look like a cow
even the cow is starving dude
that's horrible
hueso
interesting
is a volunteer in mongolia
it's super cool
but it's an experience of a lifetime
even if you don't go with peace corps it's like if you go on mission work
that's so awesome
i love it
you get to meet so much so many people
but uh
sí después le digo lo que era
me da pena no lo quería rechazar
ah un amigo
pero después yo le digo
ah es que estamos haciendo un recording
pero de todas maneras no
sí
ay yo no lo sabía
ah bueno bueno
de todas maneras
qué es esto
dónde
de qué hablas
ay no
un butterfly
rosado y negro
te estás divirtiendo ahora
sí a ti te gusta ese diseño
a ti te gusta ese diseño
a mí no me gusta
se ensucia
de qué
entonces como ves este este scenario
verdad
es muy oscuro
y es como que muy
entonces qué hubieran podido hacer
yeah but how do they how will cómo lo puedes improve
yeah
brisa
sí pero
sí
pero después cuando llueve se pone muy slippery
pero y si también sabes lo que i picture
dos edificios el la librería separada entre dos edificios y después en el medio un corredor que la gente puede cruzar al otro lado del de la librería
y así hubiera espacio
sí
es es
estás gastando
ah
o bueno este hueco más alto
y el edificio más alto
o sea sigue siendo siete pies
pero todo más alto para que ese hueco sea más largo
pero más pero para la gente
o sea es como se
would it be people friendly
like
i like furniture and buildings and i like people friendly not
cuál hueco
ah sí
sí
intereses del dinero
sí
pero si totalmente tendrías que
o sea
si
pero vamos a decir
no estoy hablando de actual realistic jobs
estoy hablando de tu creatividad
o sea tú diseñar algo porque te gusta por el aesthetically
like porque te gusta
ay yo me comí un así de grande
no porque te vi yawning
oh my goodness
y cómo está jane
yo estuve cuando yo la vi el primer día yo estuve bien con ella
no se si te contó
ay no
oh
dónde quedó qué
pero y ella se estaba enfocando
pues sí
ay yo no sé
anyway
pero qué tu hiciste eso de verdad
ella pero mira
no
le dije
toma la cámara
y me fui
porque estaba hirviendo la sangre me estaba hirviendo
no sabía qué hacer
porque mira
yo estaba llamado a gente verdad
y ese viene
y era un grupo grande
y era el domingo
estaba ahí por cuatro horas solamente
y ella se tiró enfrente del
o sea ni se tiró enfrente de mí
cogió mi cliente
lo llevó
le tomó fotos
al cliente le llegó tres cuatro familias
y le tomó fotos a todos ellos
y les vendió y ya
quedó en su número
entonces yo
ok jane yo juego contigo pero no se
no te pases
o sea
no
ella me lo cogió desde antes
no llegó gente
ella después comenzó a torcer la historia
no es que te es para ayudarte
no jane no fue para ayudarme
tú lo llamaste antes que yo lo pude hacer llegar a la cámara
entonces yo por eso me molesté porque ella asumió y tomó
sentí que estaba abusando de la amistad
o sea como se estaba riendo y todo
se cogió el cliente
y yo me fui
pero de todas maneras para mí fue una lección porque mira
cuando yo estaba hirviendo verdad
y yo sentía al señor diciéndome
cálmate cálmate cálmate
entonces dios me dijo
no te preocupes que yo te voy a mandar otra venta que va a ser aún más
pero yo no tuve paciencia para expresar para esperar en el señor
porque cuando vino ese otro cliente yo sentía algo que me dijo
este es el cliente
ese te va a comprar bastante
pero entonces vino jane y otra vez me iba a coger la cámara
y yo ahí es donde se me fue hasta el hasta la cabeza
yo le dije
toma la cámara
y me fui
porque ella jugando
ven yo te lo hago
así riéndose otra vez
y yo
oh toma la cámara
y me fui caminando
y después regresé
y le dije
mira
y ella me dijo
ay por qué te pusiste así tal cosa
no se qué
y entonces yo le dije
yo le dije
yo preferí no reaccionar así
obviamente no me hubiera gustado reaccionar así
pero ya me molestó porque sentí que te estabas like pasando
entonces ahí ya hablamos tal cosa
y resulta
el cliente ese que se quedó lo atendió marta
y les vendió setenta dólares que era más de lo que jane les había vendido
o sea dios tenía la razón
me estaba mandando el cliente
pero yo no tuve paciencia para esperar
y dejar que se me pasara la rabia
me entiendes
entonces ahí eh aprendí
pues ella se estaba poniendo mal
y yo dije
pero tú no tienes razón de ponerte mal
ella no tiene razón de estar rabiosa de nada si ella se metió
o sea
me entiendes
no
era una familia toda grande
pero yo llamé una persona
ella me quitó esa persona
entonces como ya me lo quitó atendí el hermano o el amigo de él
después llegaron más gente pero ella les tomó gente fotos a todo el grupo
incluso le dijo a todo el grupo que se pararan juntos
y les tomó fotos
no sé
sí fue un poco de negros juntos
sí dijeron morcilla
ajá ellos
entonces eso yo ya me estaba viendo
es como si me estaba hirviendo la sangre poquito a poquito
primero me llamó el cliente
y dijo
ah no importa
después llegó otro otro otro
y después llegó toda la familia
y les vendió a otro
y ni tuvo ni una vez me preguntó
gabrielle te ayudo
o son tuyos
o nada nada nada
entonces yo me puse like
y después todo eso y ya
atendiéndolos todos
eso me puso mal
mal mal mal
me molesté
marta me entendió
she was like pues cada persona tiene un vaso
y si tú lo vas llenando
y yo ella es ella le dijo a jane que se estaba exagerado porque yo solo me fui
ella dijo
preferiblemente que te hubieras ido que te hubieras explotado aquí
pero yo en mí misma yo siento que tengo
cómo se dice standard en en en español
un estándar
yo tengo un estándar más alto
yo nunca me hubiera explotado ahí
a lo por la o sea yo no lo planeaba
para mí lo que hice en irme eso fue una explosión
o sea para mi personalidad eso lo considero una explosión
aunque marta dijo
no estuvo bien lo que hiciste
tú te fuiste en vez de decir algo
o ponerte mal acá
eso está bien
pero yo sentí que no me hubiera ido
pero es que en ese momento tenía que haber aplicado la sangre de jesús porque no había manera de controlar lo que estaba pasando dentro de mí
entonces me puse súper mal
pero of course me duele
o sea me duele porque pues no quiero like dañar mi relación con ella
me entiendes
qué piensais
qué puedo hacer ahora que ya pasó
o sea preferiblemente no hubiera hecho eso
yo vi
guau señor si hubiera mantenido la paciencia tú me hubieras bendecido aún más y todo
y hubiera hablado con ella calladamente
pero en ese momento no tuve self control
you know what i mean
no importa no entienden español
ella y entonces ella le dice a marta
cállase la boca
y después marta dice
eso es lo que marta dijo a lo que ella le dijo
y entonces marta dijo
tú me dijiste eso
y entonces jane
no yo no dije eso
ahí entonces otra hora hablando con marta
arguing
discutiendo que si dijo o no dijo cállate la boca
y yo ay señor por favor
ajá pero a marta no le gusta eso porque ella es la manager

yeah
over the years i had noticed that at first you were like blanked out on the english
and i'm like

he said and you know he said he had a good childhood there
but he spent most of his years here in florida and atlanta and california and a lot of different places you know
you know and then my here comes my mom
she's from like a whole different country like columbia
that's where much most of my family comes from you know
and she was raised on a farm
and and she loved it there you know
and she had two sisters
my mom told me that they didn't have pools you know
so she'd just take a like a swim in the pond
yeah so the rest of my mom's background is now she's remarried to andrew as we talked about earlier
and she's here sitting right now live at this interview hearing us so this chat
she is a very interesting woman
ok let's move on to your parents' background
that's cool
cool
so um let's see
what else can we talk about
so um who is what is your favourite number
my birthday is on july two five twenty fifth
and my mom's birthday really weird is four days before on the twenty first of july
so she had me like like like like four days before
after her birthday you know
like awesome
yeah i was her birthday present like four days late birthday present
when uh and my dad i think he is born in
october twelfth
and um to say a little bit about him um you know
yeah he's bald
but you know he still has little hairs sticking up
yeah i know
i know like back
no no mono
no it wasn't blond

it was orange
yeah it was like down to his butt
i'm serious
so when ah were your parents born

yeah you know um you know he's like the best
and what do you have to say about anahí
yeah remember once when you you and me went with my mom para la para un parque
it was like so cool
and my mom you and me first went on this cool ride where you like sit down
and there's this little rope that you hold on to
and you go
kind of
but it's not like as high
and you go around like a circle like twice
and then i went on
then you went on it
and they said that only people thirteen and under could go on on it

um i just love it when we can just be together and bond just by ourselves
and you know i love bonding with my parents because we get a chance to chit chat and talk about what's going on with each other and about stuff that just we get comfortable around
i had a lot of self confidence
es en la en la primera vez que lo tocaron en mil ochocientos seis
se oyó y ninguno le gustó
y ah y lo tocaron entre otras piezas
como él tenía esa costumbre de tener tanta tanto material para tocar
y entonces después dice
el con el con siempre ha venido a largo tiempo
después de su primera creación empezó a estabilizarse cuando ya tenía trece años joseph joachim
era una persona que conocía beethoven
en memoria a
o lo tocó de memoria en londres por primera vez en mil ochocientos cuarenta y cuatro
y mendelssohn estaba ahí
la el la composición es increíblemente asociada a joachim porque la tocó ahí primero la primera vez
pero huberman adolf busch szigeti milstein hogan hermann y otros y no y no menos
pero de todas maneras es el concierto más difícil de tocar
y y nada de romántico tiene la cara esa de ese hombre
ellos dicen aquí que el el el caso de que abre con una como como un tímpano
a se haya ha creado muchas preguntas particularmente vistas en contraste con el liricismo
pero vamos a ver qué dice el
dónde está el otro
o k
la persona que escribe esas notas le pagan harto dinero
para decir palabras que que suenan bien
y no bueno tienen que ser ciertas por por lo por lo mayor
él empezó a trabajar en los primeros años towards the end
en bonn
no
aquí dice mil mil setecientos noventa y dos al noventa al noventa y dos
yo no sé
pero eso es lo que dice aquí
eh pero pero solamente escribió doscientos cincuenta y nueve barras del primero movimiento
el concierto en d ha sido compuesto como quince años
fue compuesto quince años más tarde que sería mil ochocientos
sí más o menos
sí
ok
en en el otoño de mil ochocientos seis franz clement quien era el jefe y conductor de la orquesta de teatro de wien en viena wein der viena
mil ochocientos dos hasta mil ochocientos once
concerto para eh clemencia para un clemente primo
violino@sita e editorio@sita al teatro de viena
escribió beethoven en sus llaman aquí macaronic
forma a la cabeza de la composición
pero no no dicen
el primer movimiento en particular es remarcable
la poca bravura yo yo no sé yo lo creo muy más eh que no le falta nada
y que thereby matching the style of clement'seng piano
y tengo que seguir en español
lo que pasa es que estoy traduciendo de un una página a la otra
para mí francamente cuando yo lo pongo lo primer las primeras cinco notas lo que yo recuerdo es bethoven es mozart
en un momento oscuro yo puedo o o o equivocarme si es mozart o o o es beethoven
conciertos y las sinfonías
yo he visto a este señor muchas veces pero
a itzhak perlman
pero
él él tuvo polio
y él él tiene él ha venido aquí muchas veces
pero nunca me ha y tiene familia aquí también en miami
pero él nació en
en israel
daniel barenboim también nació en israel
pero se las encontraron las ha encontrado bien aquí
daniel barenboim
oh
para que fuera al hospital
se llama
cómo es que se llama eso
tiene un nombre especial
esos niños de la familia brown donde todos cinco hijos están tocando
ellos ellos están ahí ahora
tener cinco personas que tocan tan
tan fantásticamente
cierta mezcla
aquí no debe estar
el chiquito no estaba tocando originalmente
cuando lo pusieron la primera vez en en en sesenta minutos
el chiquito no no no estaba solamente los los dos muchachos y las dos muchachas
bueno yo sé que el menor es un un niño
todos
sí
no el el menor se ve menor todavía
y y la madre empezó a enseñarles a los tres años
ah yo tengo que llamar a lisa porque le dije que el piano no es un juguete
no está qué
no está aprendiendo
no ha tomado no está tomando clases todavía
y y no es una cosa para que alguien diga
ay que lindo y que bueno que le mandan un piano
es una cosa para estudiar
y cuando yo le hablo a juan pablo se pone bien serio
dice que no
no entiendes
sí
pero él no tiene ninguno que le que le diga cómo es que suena cierta nota
y lisa quedó en buscarle al maestro
y después que la maestra en el edificio no quería porque ella toca en la en la sinfónica
y yo no sé qué
ella no tiene tiempo para eso
pero hay maestros en el colegio
él está yendo a un colegio adventista
costándole el la los ojos de la cara pero
yo no sé
no sé
la mamá del muchacho
la mamá es es lisa
no sé
no no sé
ella ella trabaja en otro colegio
pero el colegio que ella trabaja no es adventista
no él me dijo que le gusta el colegio
se está está fascinado con con el colegio porque nunca antes ha entrado en ese
yo creo que él fue él va a escuela sabática
no es lo mismo que la escuela
pero en colegio adventista no he estado anteriormente
no lo sé
escuela escuelita
y a y sale desde bien temprano
y llega bien tarde
cuándo tú hablaste con él
en su casa
ah
porque a él le fascina hablar por teléfono
cuando suena el teléfono él dice yo quiero hablar con mi tía
y lisa
ella nunca me dijo eso
y yo le dije
lisa eso debo ser lo último que él oye por la noche
no de esas basuras y esas novelas que tú estás oyendo
bueno le lo estoy controlando yo estoy controlando a ella desde aquí
ella lo tiene que controlar desde allá
eso le sí que le han sacado plata a esa a esa canción time to say goodbye
yo creo que la tienen en todo disco de toda clase para todo el mundo
ese ese paul potts y la persona de inglaterra
sí
y cantó en uno de sus programas cómo
es algo similar a america
es el mismo señor que lo
americas idol
sí
pero allá no le llaman ídolo americano
ellos lo llaman
yo no sé cómo es que lo llaman allá
pero es una cosa distinta
y me parece raro que que ese majadero del hombre ese no ha podido decirle vamos a buscar una canción para ti
para que sea la canción de él
así sea nueva
o sea vieja
pero que sea algo nuevo
potts
él está cantando nessun dorma en todas partes donde va
cantó para la reina de inglaterra la semana pasada
no la semana antepasada o en enero
y entonces estaba en a b c la semana pasada
y cantó la misma canción otra vez
nessun dorma es la canción con la cual se clasifica
ah pavorotti
no tenía que coger esa
yo no estoy diciendo que sí tal vez él canta esa más que cualquiera otra
pero una persona que canta tan bien así muy bien podrían prepararlo con una canción así ya sea
cómo es que se dice
it's been a day
esa eh que canta el quinteto el cuarteto ese de hombres
cualquiera de esa canción no tenía que ser clásica no nada
entonces la otra canción que tiene es time to say goodbye
esa ya tiene su dueño
él no no puede estar cantando esa tantas veces
yo voy a tener que escribirle una noticia a paul
entonces tiene creo que ave maría
no todo el mundo está diciendo eso que que que no tiene una canción de sí mismo
y va a tener que ir a un dentista también porque tiene esos dientes encaramados uno encima de los otros
o un
tal vez a un cirujano plástico y que le abra más los labios para que le quepan los dientes
ya yo lo estoy arreglando
sí
y y y y y y porque no lo pueden hacer entonces
está bien vestido ahora
eso sí
y el el pelo está bien cortado
pero hay que cambiar el las canciones
por porque
yo yo yo le voy a mandar una lista de los que yo quiero
él deber tener una una cosa en el
cómo es que se llama
en el internet uno puede mandarle mensajes
eh blog
por eso
sí ahí uno puede escribirlas ahí
sí pero ellos lo leen ellos lo leen ahí de todas maneras
ellos leen lo que él escribe
y lo que la gente corresponde
así que yo yo le voy a decir
tiene que arreglarse lo dientes
tiene que echarse un poquito de sol
y tiene que encontrar esa canción que solamente sea para él
y yo creo que esa
sí yo creo que lo
mientras no se haga sucio no no tengo restricciones
ah esa canción que que cantan it's been a it's been a day it's the end of the the
esa es la que yo creo que él debería cantar
hay hay una una que dice it's five o'clock somewhere
en alguna parte tiene que ser las cinco de la tarde
yo no yo no yo no creo eso porque
a a a toda hora no puede haber un lugar donde es las cinco de la tarde
sí eso sí es cierto
ajá
el el el sol nunca estaba puesto en todo su imperio
sí
tú sabes esos relojes relajo que tienen la hora
qué hora es en francia
qué hora es en egipto
que
o k
tú pones cada uno en las cinco la hora no son muchos los lugares
eh tú tendrás unos para israel tiene unas horas distintas creo
ah londres tiene una hora distinta
parís tiene otra hora
inglaterra tiene otra hora
japón tiene otra hora
alaska tiene otra hora
pero no creo que hay veinticuatro lugares que tenga
es que es una canción
así que yo no creo que es
es una canción de de este señor que anda cantando música regular
y dice que en alguna parte tiene que ser las cinco de la tarde
pero es lo que quiere decir
que en alguna parte en cualquiera parte tiene que ser hora de de tomar
eso es lo que quiere decir
no es el reloj que que dice que es las cinco de la tarde
este es lo lo que quiero que el sello tenga
ustedes lo pueden hacer en una manera bonita o
ay yo no puedo encontrar un artista así no más
entonces cada uno y entonces para sellar ponerle el sello a cosas distintas
y usted las tienen
pero la tinta entonces de qué color se
porque tal vez un día lo quiero brillante y otro día lo quiero rosado
será que en esto sí puede decir que tengo ganas de ir para el baño
por qué no
es una cosa natural
no
me vas a decir que que que que
oh
entonces van a tener que esperarse de que yo puedo hacer eso
eh el sam trató de conseguir al señor que le arreglara la computadora porque él dice que está muy muy lenta
el bendito hombre le dijo
y temí que que iba a hacer eso
y no creo que es por la distancia
le dijo que era muy lejos
que no valía la pena
lo que yo creo es que tal vez no quería
sam no le gusta la gente de iran
yeah
ninguno de esos ninguno de esos de esos países
no no dice eso a la gente latina
mentira no no no no no no no
no y y y y y y y y charlie
no no no no no charlie freddy
y él ama a freddy como el alma de de como su propia madre
no es cierto que no los quiere
ah eso sí
eso sí es cierto
él yo no más he escuchado una solo dos canciones de este señor
y de scarlatti no más hay dos que me gustan
y yo
sí
porque yo compré una específica
y no tenía lo que yo quería
padre y madre
padre e hijo
sí es padre e hijo
sí
pero eran es son como composiciones bien corticas
es es es este domenico
el padre se llamaba lorenzo
no era
alguien dijo el otro día
el pobre
a no estaba pensando en en bach
tenía once hijos
y todos estaban en el mismo cuarto
cómo se la arreglaba para hacer tantos hijos y hacer música también
él no
no dicen dicen que él está
ves
ahí está
con todo
bueno él enseñaba en la escuela de lepsis
pero por la noche se iba para su casa
handel también
digo haydn también
pero ellos muchas veces se robaban de aquí y de allí
ah ya
cómo se llama
en en brasil hay un hombre que que escribió bachianas brasileñas
y es es a base de de
cómo se llamaba él
no sé va
lobo
something lobo
ah
qué maluco que están esta gente
y eran supuestamente aristocráticos
no guitarra
paganini
oh yeah
él tiene él él él tiene unos de violín que que que y guitarra sí
hay una tal gabriela que toca las la la música de él
giuliani
yo no sé
yo creo que juan pablo debe concentrarse primero en piano
aunque piano uno puede aprenderlo cuando esté mayor también
pero puesto que ahora todo el que tiene piano va a tener que aprender piano primero
pero
no no no no violín no es fácil
lo siento mucho
lo que lo que pasa es que que el violín
suzuki pero no es porque el violín es más fácil
no es más fácil
uno de los los violinistas dice
tú puedes aprender violín piano cualquiera hora de tu vida
pero violín no
y el y y no
bueno si aprenden de pequeño bien con alguien que valga la pena
pero yo creo que ese maestro que que stephen tenía no
él él tocaba tal vez cuatro rancheras y un y un vals
y eso no no
bueno la cosa es que en el lugar donde él vive se coge un milagro para sacar algo bueno de ahí
un un un milagro y entonces después algo más
él se murió no
él se murió
sí porque esmeralda fue al entierro
yo no recuerdo
fue el año antepasado o pasado que alguien me dijo
sí estaba hinchado y los riñones y otra cosa
y él estaba casado con otra persona y
hillary
y entonces me dijo pero este estaba ahí con los niños con los hijos
el tema es de lo que de lo del manicure manicure y pedicure que los hombres se hacen
qué piensa usted de eso
a ti te gusta eso
no a mí no me gusta
yo estoy preguntándote
pero si tú dices que que que a ti te gusta y te parece nice yo yo respeto tu tu
yo respeto tu forma de pensar
yo no yo no me lo hago
yo no me lo hago y
oh no i'm not
no
yo creo que me lo hago simplemente para if i have a party or something like that
if i have a party you know i want to look nice that's it
pero no porque necesito you know hacérmelo siempre
ah
no
pero ahora mismo tú me estabas diciendo que te gustaba y te parecía nice
o sea que
so in some ways you you like to watch the the the of your friends and
and things like that
oh
why you bite your nails because you you you you are nervous
sí
oh my god
y ese ese tipo de nervios why is that
something about it related to your nails also
ah
oh parece que te preocupa mucho lo de las uñas

carece de algún gusto
so tú en cierta manera no apoyas eso lo de las uñas
uh
so si ahora mismo la señora que está ahí te viene y te dice
mire quiero hacerle las uñas a usted y el pedicure
usted se lo hace
uh
pero sí son uñas de todos modos

como que no that you love him more than you love me
sabes
no pero entonces yo llego
hmm
pero no pero es que maría es muy muy sensible y se guarda todo
so she doesn't talk to anyone
entonces
i didn't know that she was that bad
hasta que se se emborrachó
y ahí fue que que caí en cuenta y yo dije bueno o sea
ah
no
no pero fue la primera que yo estuve presente
sabes la primera que se desahogó conmigo
y maría está mal mal
que yo le dije
maría deberías ir a un psicólogo
ya cuando estaba allá le digo

y yo
maría porque sabes estás mal
y me dice

y yo y que
maría vamos juntas
y me dice
y de paso que yo no puedo ir a una persona ahí que está que no conozco

entonces
yo sé
entonces maría
él se fue un momento que tuvo que hacer una cosa
y maría me dice

we couldn't print out the boarding pass
justamente porque seguro era porque tú lo tenías que conocer a él
y yo y que

al día siguiente tampoco fui a nueva york
no me acuerdo por qué
pero no fui
fui con maría a nueva york
pero entonces ese día yo llego
y maría sabes estamos así todo el día
y me encontré con alberto con mi amigo
entonces dejamos a maría en la oficina de de la tipa
ellos se regresaron a la casa
y yo me quedé con él en time square paseando
ese día me llevé tacones
maría me hizo caminar cuarenta cuadras
esta el autobús nos dejó desde new jersey
nos dejó en la ciento setenta y ocho in broadway
mi hermanita bella
no ya te lo juro que estoy demasiado ubicada ya más que alberto
porque el vive en queens en manhattan
y soy o sea
entonces llega
y la niña me daba miedo
el el celular que me compré
le daba miedo montarse en el metro por en el subway porque ella no sabía
sabes no sabía cómo qué agarrar y tal
y yo le digo
valeria
sabes me hizo caminar desde la ciento setenta y ocho hasta la ciento treinta
en tacones
y yo y que
obviously
y yo y que o k
hasta que llegó un momento que yo dije
ya no no ya
maría we are getting on the subway whether you like it or not
bajamos que fue cuando el tipo nos dijo
just take that one sabe y
it's my first time in new york by myself
first time getting a subway in new york by myself
y yo y que
o k
scare paranoid obviamente
estaba demasiado paranóica así como que o k sabes
me dijeron que esto es un malandreo sabes que
ten cuidado
y de paso que cuando nos dejó en la ciento setenta y ocho
estamos caminando
y maría llama a la mamá de la amiga y le dice
mira estamos en la ciento setenta y ocho
sálganse de ahí
que eso es un barrio que no sé qué broma y tal
y yo y que
what
sí que eso es un barrio y tal
yo llamo a alberto
y no me contesta
y yo le dejo un mensaje
alberto llámame
rescátame que estamos en un barrio
ayúdame
no sé cómo llegar salirnos de aquí y tal
alberto me dice
no sabes no es un barrio
si no que ahí hay mucho mucha gente que todo el mundo te te va a echar los perros
sabes todo el mundo te va a decir cosas
pero no les pares sigues caminando y ya
y yo bueno o k entonces yo le digo a maría
maría camina rápido
y como si supieras a dónde vamos
o sea no tengas cara de perdida
y ella
bueno o k
entonces las dos caminando cuarenta cuadras hasta que por fin nos montamos en el subway
y bueno ya ahí sí llegamos a time square buenísima
y nada entonces ellos se fueron
y alberto
sabes y eso fue
fuimos a pace university
ese día solo fuimos a pace
pero caminamos todo time square
sabes ese día caminamos
no
es que fue un viaje de universidad
o sea no fui al empire state
no fui a
no fui a nada
a nada
pero es que uno
exacto
pero es que the thing is that i wasn't there
sabes no estaba ahí para para hacer eso
sino ir a las universidades y ya
en enero
ah
mi second option o sea no yo voy a aplicar a todas
en n y u no puedo aplicar ahorita
entonces en agosto aplico para empezar en enero
y ahorita sabes voy a aplicar en todas las que vi
vi como ocho universidades
sí
sí pero no
o sea sí por los momentos
pero si de aquí me decido por otra carrera me voy a cambiar
porque sabes que a mí me gusta es la moda y el diseño y la actuación y todo eso
entonces estamos en la oficina de la tipa que está en el sexto piso
y en la en el edificio de enfrente
sabes es pura vitrina entonces en el edificio de enfrente también estaban otras tipas en en la en otra en otra oficina
estaban todas apagadas menos en esa
y habían cinco mujeres
entonces una se quita la camisa
y se pone otra y no sé qué broma
y la gente sabes
como que era una broma de de diseño
que diseñaban camisas
i don't know
cómo se dice
no sé o sea que que they were hemming the shirt
sabes como que fitting it
y era sabes como como una compañía de diseño
entonces yo estoy viendo eso
y yo dije
perro te imagina qué fino sería estudiar diseño en nueva york
y estar en una oficina así diseñando ropa
y yo dije
sabes
me llama demasiado la atención
y entonces sabes me puse a pensar
y yo y que
perro y si me cambio de psicología y no sé qué broma en n y u
chama te lo juro estuve a punto
sabes yo dije
me voy a cambiar a estudiar business
solo porque mira en n u u tienen un programa
no sé cómo haces para entrar en el programa
cuando estudias business que hay un programa que tienes la opción de estudiar o sea los cuatro años de carrera
el primer año en nueva york el segundo en parís el cuarto en londres y el quinto en shanghai
o sea yo vi eso
y yo y que
no voy a estudiar psicología voy a estudiar business
sí
son cincuenta mil al año including the dorms
without dorms it's like thirty thirty five
pero los dorms están
tú te conoces más o menos manhattan
sabes time square está en la cuarenta y dos y
y o sea y la siete y la ocho está por ahí
los dorms nuevos de n y u para upper classman que es que sería yo quedan en la veintitrés y la tercera avenida
o sea queda yo fui a a college que queda en ahí
y caminamos hasta time square que sabes son veinte cuadras
que ya para mí las cuadras son veinte pasos
sí lo peor es que sí
entonces sabes entonces el tipo nos dice
the the new dorms have wood floors
counter top de granito
lavadora y secadora adentro del apartamento
sabes es una cosa que yo dije
en ese dorm sí me quedo
sabes o sea en los otros dorms los vi
y son horribles horribles
sí sí a todas
la única que no hice el tour de la universidad fue n y u
porque fui
o sea era una hora del del una hora y media del information session
y la otra era del del del colegio
pero sabes después del information session me gustó tanto que yo dije
la verdad no me importa
y de paso que ya maría estaba cansada
entonces sabes se quería regresar
entonces no hicimos el tour ese
pero hicimos
sabes el information session
te lo juro solo con eso los profesores son los mejores
todo es así demasiado fino
fue la que más me llamó la atención
entonces son cincuenta mil al año con los dorms
y treinta y cinco entre treinta y treinta y cinco
no me acuerdo sin los dorms o sea el tuition nada más
pero sabes estoy aplicando a lo del
para que me den broma
y voy a aplicar a becas
y toda broma sabes obviamente all the help i can get
ayuda
pero del resto sabes no
ay no sé estoy demasiado emocionada
me quiero ir ya sabes
ah
sí
pero ella fue
ella aplicó como transfer
por que
en las universidades que vi yo o sea los transfer students aceptan como sesenta y ocho créditos
no te los aceptan
sabes if i have ninety credits and i wanna transfer they only accept sixty eight
será
no no sé si se puede pero tienes que averiguarlo
pero eso sería para para cuándo
o sea para mudarte en agosto a orlando
what
qué en serio
mentira
oh my god it's so serious
pero el apartamento de tu mamá todavía o sea no lo va a vender
exacto
exacto
asco
ajá
si no no no
los gatos son traicioneros
exacto
ok
y tiene veinticinco años
la la mujer de la casa exacto
ajá
exacto
ah mentira ah no
exacto
ya va ya va antes de que me cuentes sabes que miguel se casa
qué opinas
sí
eres la primera que me dice que está de acuerdo
no
ok pero tú sabes la situación de ella
ella no tiene papeles
ese es el miedo de juana juan de todo el mundo
tu tío todavía no sabe
yo pienso que no se van a casar porque yo pienso que cuando él le diga a tu tío
tu tío le va a decir
estás loco eres un niño
o sea piensa bien las cosas
o sea es una tipa de veintisiete años con un chamito de veinte
y otra cosa o sea ella a mí me cae demasiado bien la adoro es lo máximo
hoy la llamé y llorando conmigo y yo y que
ay sabes tranquila sabes regresa pronto y tal
no no sí lo
por eso
el mi rollo no es lo de los papeles
sinceramente yo sí pienso ella es perro tiene veintisiete años
yo creo que ya está lista para casarse
sabes
mari es demasiado inmaduro pero es demasiado inmaduro
te voy a quitar uno
sí
no no no
yo lo único que digo que no me parece de la relación de ellos es que antonio es demasiado alegre demasiado tranquilo sabes o sea demasiado contento pues ahorita ahorita que finalmente ya todo le está saliendo bien
sabes y lo que le gusta es salir y joder y sabes y pasarla bien
y ella es full amotinada
o sea ella es everything her way y si no se amotina
por ejemplo el día que yo llegué el lunes
bueno llegué a las dos de la mañana
fuimos a casa de juan
estuvimos ahí
y después nos fuimos al express carmen miguel y yo
y carmen tenía demasiado sueño
entonces se quedó dormida en el carro
y miguel y yo estábamos comiendo
él se estaba comiendo una hamburguesa y yo dos empanadas
y estábamos comiendo así de lo más normal
y entra carmen
gritó
a abre la puerta
miguel me voy ya que no sé que broma que estés en la casa
y yo y que
ok
y yo le dijo
danos un minuto
sabes a a miguel le quedaba esto de la hamburguesa
le digo
espérate que se termine la hamburguesa
y vamos sabes tranquila
pero sabes son cosas así
y no es la primera vez pues
ella como que es muy amotinada
no
worst
entonces sabes como que eso no me parece porque
no sé o sea yo sé que él está contento con ella
pero él yo sé que no ha superado a petra
y petra tampoco lo ha superado a él
tampoco tampoco digo que esté con petra porque ya esa relación está dañada
ya no va a nunca va a ser lo mismo
eso es oto y alicia
exacto pero sabes como que ya no sé o sea
i don't think that she's the love of his life
everything it's too fast
and o sea llevan dos meses
ok te lo acepto
been living together
been with each other twenty four hours a day for three months
pero oye a la vez sabes no sé siento qué es muy rápido
no sé por qué
juan es el único que le dijo
no me parece
no estoy de acuerdo
no sé qué broma
y cuándo él me lo dijo a mí
yo juan sabía
entonces estábamos él y yo afuera solo
y entonces me dice
i've good news and bad news
y yo
bueno
what do you want first
y yo le dijo
ok the bad news
pensaba que tenía que ver con mariela the bad news
entonces me dice
i'm not gonna be single any more
y yo
ok you're not single any
y entonces me dice
but the good news is that i'm getting married
cuando me lo dijo así
entonces me dice
before you say anything no me regañes
te lo pido
just be happy for me
me mordí la lengua
y dije
ok i'm just gonna be happy for him
no le voy a dar mi opinión nada porque he doesn't want it
exacto exacto
me dice
no quiero que seas como juan que me regañó que
claro
no porque sí lo ayer cuando estábamos en el sabes ellos salieron un momento y nos quedamos la hermana de ella ella y yo
la chama me miró
y se le salieron las lágrimas
y yo y que
no
entonces se puso a llorar mal
y me dice
no voy a poder
me dice
no o sea no no voy a poder sin él tanto tiempo
me dice
sabes tengo tres meses viviendo con él
y lo amo demasiado
no voy a poder sin él
y regresa el diez el quince de junio
juan me dijo que le dan dos semanas
nosotros tenemos a un amigo adrian en el
que él él ha venido pero no no mucho
o sea todas las vacaciones que le dan obviamente viene para acá porque tiene la familia aquí

you know i've already had my body being dependent on on medicine
i don't want to take even more medicine if i could find something else that helps me

ajá
you're talking about instead of having inside

that is the most fucked up thing i've ever heard you say
because the baby's supposed to be inside the woman
eso es eso es como si fuera un producto
eso no es no es una persona
eso es eso es eso es eso es tan contra dios y contra la naturaleza que la i la iglesia está opuesta a todo eso
es tan es tan contra la vida
stem cell

sí eso mismo
esa mismo es
yo sé yo sé todo eso
esos esos tés son orgánicos
y son hechos como en la en la tradición hindú de ayurveda ayurveda ayurveda
ayurdeva * ayurveda
ayurdevic * ayurvedic ayurvedic
um
you told me it was eighteen
yes
eso es new age
yo sé
aha
oh it was so i
lo que a mí me gustaba de coconut grove es que ahí está el templo hare krishna
y ahí ellos antes se pasaban así
es misión
eso no eso no es cristiano
porque por lo menos los cristianos le daban los misioneros
porque por lo menos
lo que mi entendimiento de las misiones católicas
en eh le daban comida
no importaba y después si querían querían aprender del cristianismo pues le enseñaban
pero eso no era de
no no no un besito
o k un besito en la
así que regresastes
regresastes a la familia
por lo menos busca por lo menos este entendemos que o sea los católicos entendemos que esto es un proceso
porque y nos tenemos que ayudar los unos a los otros
eh al al a la meta que es la santidad
pues dios nos eh jesus nos dijo que este todos podíamos ser santos
a hacer un apostolado de los the ravers
ravers
bueno no importa que no te guste
pero como a mí me gusta
y como en verdad
sí
pero es que yo a mi me gustaba
yo probé éxtasis a los veintiuno
pero yo a mi me encantaba esa música ya de joven
a los dieciséis los diecisiete me yo yo oía esa música
what
bueno es que como yo tengo mis issues
pues no te lo recomiendo
yo traté algo que era similar era l s a
era unas era unas semillas
se llamaban hawaiian baby woodrose
y yo hice un té
se supone que eran con cinco semillas
en vez de d es l s a
no no no cállate
no
yo he leído todo esto
i i
yes
yes
bueno es que yo quiero que tú tú aprendas de mi experiencia
este lo que pasó fue que
dame fé dios
yo quiero creer en ti
yeah
yo te estoy cuidando porque yo no
pero lo lo
lo que pasó fue que la primera vez que lo hice hice los cinco nada más es cinco
tú haces un té con cinco cinco semillas
you grind them
you grind them
la de los colombianos dicen que los estuvieron siguiendo en caliente
que por eso no se dieron cuenta
y tuvieron que seguir pasar el límite de porque estaban en una persecución prácticamente en el momento en que pasaba
y no lo podían dejar escapar al tipo
los estaban siguiendo
supuestamente cruzaron
la versión colombiana es que estaban en colombia
y de colombia pasaron a ecuador
that's what they say
that's that's what colombia say
but cuando tú hablas con la gente de ecuador ecuador dice
no
por qué
porque cuando fueron a ver todo lo que pasó después del bombardeo cuando ya vieron a la gente que estaba prácticamente muerta o laying on on en en el piso supuestamente estaban en ropa de dormir
cómo tú puedes pensar que los estás siguiendo de un país a otro en ropa de dormir
la versión del ecuador es que ellos estaban camping en el territorio ecuatoriano
y que los colombianos cruzaron la frontera
y los bombardearon cuando ellos estaban durmiendo
los colombianos
hmm
cuál de todas
bueno la la cosa es que esa es la versión que dicen los colombianos
la versión de los ecuatorianos pues es esa de que ellos estaban durmiendo
entonces existe lo que es
gracias a dios después de todo el bombardeo que hubo pudieron calcular una computadora
que yo creo que para mí esa es la razón por la cual cuando vino la la reunión de río que estuvieron todos los presidentes uribe tenía todos los papeles y todos los ases debajo de la manga
por eso es que tu querido presidente correa tuvo que morderse la lengua
morderse la lengua y decir que está bien que se acababa el conflicto
lo mismo que chávez y lo mismo que nuestro gran amigo noriega
esa es la versión que supuestamente se baraja
las farc
exactamente
claro porque tú sabes cómo es correa
correa considera que es el dueño de la palabra
y la onu prácticamente lo dijo
colombia no tenía por qué traspasar ecuador
aun así que estaba siguiendo a un terrorista como reyes que era la primera o la segunda cabeza de farc
no why
no no here
no
ya
no but she's changing
why why you need it
that's is the letter that's is the sign you have
no no todavía le falta
no
no
no yo con los republicanos no voy
no voy ni a misa
ni a misa voy con los republicanos
bueno entonces eso fue lo que pasó
tú tú no viste lo que lo que correa le hizo a uribe
se levantó
prácticamente lo dejó con la boca abierta
y el señor uribe para mí un señor le dijo
no
si el señor si el presidente del ecuador no está enfrente mío no voy a decir absolutamente nada
y lo esperó
y lo esperó
y cuando correa se sentó uribe habló
y uribe fue un caballero porque cuando este señor este el de el de república dominicana le pidió que por favor pues trataran de llegar a un consenso uribe fue quien se levantó y le dio la mano a a tu presidente correa
no hermana yo considero que ese no es no es mi no es mi línea en el país
y tú sabes lo que hizo con el asunto de las herencias
tú tienes un problemita también ahí
está aplicando un un porcentaje un impuesto del treinta y cinco por ciento
de herencias
por ejemplo god forbid something happen to to your mom
y tú tienes por ejemplo digamos ciento cincuenta mil en bienes
allá porque tú tienes que heredarlos allá
antes de tú recibirlos tienes que pagarle al gobierno el treinta y cinco por ciento
se lo coge el gobierno
porque ese es un un impuesto que el señor correa le ha puesto a los pelucones
y te consideras pelucona porque tienes una herencia de más de ciento cincuenta mil dólares
ciento cincuenta ciento cincuenta mil a doscientos mil
si es menos
it's just menos de menos de eso no hay problemas
puedes recibir la herencia
pero si tienes un dólar más de eso te antes estaba aplicando el setenta por ciento
y todo el mundo prácticamente se puso en contra
y supuestamente bajó al treinta y cinco por ciento
pero todo es por la gente de dinero
eso me lo dijo maría
no ya está aprobado
señorita está aprobado así que ponga el póngase pilas
póngase pilas porque la cosa está seria
estaba hablando con mi hermano también
y también le estaba contando que le quería comentar eso a mi tía carla por los muchachos
el edificio hermana que yo creo que tiene un buen valor
y es treinta y cinco por ciento estamos hablando de un buen billete hermana
estamos hablando de cuánto en doscientos mil
estamos hablando de cuarenta
un poquito más sesenta
son quince y quince cuarenta cinco cincuenta como cincuenta mil
es mucho dinero
y tú sabes lo que a mí me dijo clara que me prácticamente me dio ese ese advice que se están haciendo como una especie de inmobiliaria todo lo que son los bienes
exactly
that's the best thing to do it to deal with that
ya
coño que me sacan bastante
me sacan bastante esos hijos de su madre
even though you have a w two and you're working for a like an employee
yeah ok
yeah but por ejemplo for example maría
she can do it
if she wants
because in this year when we made the taxes for her she have a
she have a nine thousands
cómo se dice la palabra en english
en contra
a a negative
nine thousands five hundred something
no that's good for for her para
ajá
three
three two
two forty
yeah i know
i know that
i know that
i'm
for her because she tried
but i i give it to her the advise to waiting one more year to see what happens
yeah but i don't i don't supposed to tell her that her husband
yeah
yeah but tú sabes qué
el problema de aquí que no me gustan son los taxes is too high
miramar is too high
is too high
i thinking maybe i don't know un poquito más arriba
yeah but when you try to find out the the how much you are supposed to pay for the homeowners insurance insurance
yeah i know
i know but de todas maneras
do you know how much they pay just for the *
they paying
* they even they no paying
november two thousand six
five thousand nine hundred
two ninety five two eighty eight every month
one thousand one hundred and fifty el abogado este
no se mató nadie
este el abogado estaba muy muy bonito para que estuvimos in plantation donde el lawyer
y para qué nos trataron muy bien
you cannot stop it
you cannot do it that
si para que la oficina y todo la gente al principio todos estaban como un poquito tú sabes pensando que ellos no querían pagar
pero nada que ver el el veterano se paró
josé bien parado el hombre
tiene su carácter
y mis respetos para él
me dijo
usted no me puede a mí decir ni culparme porque es un pago automático de un banco que yo ni siquiera puedo ver desde mi país
una cuenta que yo tengo ahí
y que supuestamente ustedes deben sacar el dinero automáticamente
no fue mi culpa
y no fue mi problema porque yo no vivo aquí
y yo vengo una vez por por año
y le dijo
yo no estoy
yo no estoy
me dice
negando la la responsabilidad de pagar
yo te quiero pagar
le dijo
y yo no me voy a ir de aquí si usted me dice que no porque esto va a seguir con va a seguir subiendo
yo quiero pagar
y quiero pagarle ahora
el abogado subió
el abogado subió entró otra vez
trajo un papel
se lo hizo firmar
y le condonaron los intereses
sí
le condonaron los intereses
lo que no pudimos condonar fue el fee del del abogado
eso sí fue imposible
no nadie
no but a hundred and fifty is nothing
one thousand and something
no
no pero supuestamente están haciendo algunos este van a hacer algunos correctivos
aparte de los que ya hicieron
están promoviendo una ley para ayudar a toda la gente porque es demasiado la gente que se va a poner en foreclosure
sí
no pero las estadísticas son peores para este año
la cantidad es estratosférica
es que estamos en época de elecciones
en época de elecciones para cualquier país tomar alguna decisión o tomar algún buen rumbo no es difícil
hasta que no se sepa quién va a ser la cabeza que se sienta en enero
hasta que más o menos no coja las las riendas estamos hablando de junio del dos mil nueve
definitivamente
y yo creo que si se ponen como están las cosas mcclain o no creo que barack obama gane
me parece imposible que que gane
email
músulman musulmán
ya se me olvidó vieja
pero lo que sí te digo es que dicen no sé lo leí que cuando él hizo un juramento o algo porque él no estaba aquí estaba afuera él hizo un juramento en el corán
no lo hizo en la biblia
y que el padre que era que era este no sé de qué parte de allá es lo dejó al año
y luego la mujer se casó con otro también
y él estuvo en en en universidades y estuvo en colegios de los extremistas
él no estuvo en ninguna ni ni católica ni ni de aquí tampoco
y que realmente él él tiene todo tiene todo ese tipo de religión
no sé pues la religión que se llama la de las que ellos usan los extremistas
no la recuerdo bien
pero él tiene muy poco
él es muy joven comparado a la experiencia de hillary que tiene treinta y cinco años
la experiencia de mcclain que tiene veinticinco
aunque es más viejo se piensa que debería tener más experiencia
hillary la tiene más que él
él lo que es político
y barack obama este y barack obama es muy joven apenas creo que no llega ni a diez ni a quince años a veinte años
y además lo que es lo que es su imagen lo que es su imagen internacional no tiene el el carisma que tiene la hillary clinton a nivel internacional
el problema es que se critica porque es mujer
y porque es mujer se considera que involucra las emociones
y para hacer para hacer un presidente no puedes involucrar las emociones
debes ser pragmático
y ese es el gran defecto de las mujeres
pero considero también que si tú le pones unas pocos de emociones a las decisiones de las personas que han llegado a este país que en la mayoría perdón al mundo que han sido hombres creo que obtendríamos un mejor mundo que el que tenemos ahora
y para mí yo sí creo que este país merece una mujer como presidente
yo sí creo
y esta señora tiene los las credenciales
tiene todo
lo malo de ella fue el llantito ese que hizo al principio de las elecciones que fue lo que prácticamente pues la la desdibujó un poco en el aplomo que que usó cuando pasó lo del marido con la la mónica
eso fue lo que la empezó como quien dice a desbaratar
y y aparte pues el a omaba también lo molestó en parte lo del lo de su inexperiencia en lo que más le han dado más fuerte
go ahead
ya
yeah
tell me
oh yeah yeah
in what category
which one
but how plane

we are good here
ok we're good for this one
yeah
ok
let me get up
now let's see what comes out here
you know like it gets me so sad
because it's like a waste
you see how it's still like

oh look it was just like here
they're good here
let's see
this is a thirty six exposure isn't it long

this is the one i got in quick as fuck
but at the end i didn't care that much
ok this right here is
ok let's do it like this ok
fuck the picture fuck the picture
look that's a whale picture right there
this is the horse
and i was playing some game there
and ah this is the my grandfather's birthday party

yeah and a bag
oh jorge'seng bed here
and that's at school
yeah i fucked up a lot of my whale pictures yeah
these are all the whale but on the other one i took some whales

oh i think
that's a different that's a different negative
why do you have that negative there

how how is that happening
becky'seng there cathy'seng there
that's cathy right there
look at a thirty six exposure because like all different
no i never had a thirty six
yup
yeah
the fan yeah
the
it looks pretty contrasting though
do you like contrasting
bring down the the filter
go go now so you can see
mami they don't find gaseo aquí
wait i'm gonna
put it here and then
i need to clean it first
which one
you can print from there if you want
that's someone else's work
i still have a headache
how about you
yeah
what that this is what they do at navarro
i think that they if they have a machine
because i don't think
what i guess little little marielitos will van a estar ahí developing
tienes que hacer esto manolo
es flow watch
se te olvidó hijo
too too much strong
i don't know
for me it's a natural way to regulate stuff
y te analiza el tipo de sangre um y otras características
it might help
but the good stuff is that it's never going to do anything like wrong to you like it's not going to affect you negatively
and you force them to look like spanish
and sometimes you can make it like
but dilute it's not how how do you say
it's good that you're doing this stuff
and and you have your things to take care of yourself
it's good
it's good
but still i what i was telling you is that we can check a couple of books and maybe ah like self help something
and i actually need to check some books for myself
ginger
it's like a little bitter
so ginger es jengibre
how long are your eh periods
three days five six
consider all the all the facts of ah just been a woman
no every
yeah
but if you get pregnant you need to give birth through there
yo no estoy de acuerdo con eso
i don't like like natural birth
for me natural birth it's just unnatural
it was another way for god to punish people
women once again
but the the person will be able to keep the same shape and the the muscle tone and everything
i am thinking that
i wouldn't say that it's enough
i don't know
i don't like that
ah you know that i i have blood phobia
did you know that
in spanish is hematofobia
but ah like ten years ago
that's the point about freaking where i always
it's about blood too
i do not like when i don't know people is bleeding
and i'm becoming stronger
but um how can i say this
once i was um giving blood
and the guy i i told him i told i told him
don't say that
i don't know
i told him i told him clearly clearly
ah i i'm i'm more than happy to give blood
i am going to try
but i i have blood phobia
so i need you to be close to me and talk to me and stuff like that for me not to think about what i am doing and feel and imagine what i'm doing because
it it could happen if i if if my mind is focused on that
es es lo que yo te estaba diciendo
y se fue
y yo me quedé ahí
entonces tratando de pensar otra cosa otra cosa otra cosa
y no fui capaz
entonces cuando me miré el brazo i i i just no sé empecé a pensar sangre estoy estoy sangre sangre
hot flushes
he was just negligent
and talk to me like
if i'm doing this for you because i do not like it and i know that i could faint
so i fainted
and it was so deep
and i felt like shit
have you fainted some once or
those are even more painful
dime sí o no nada más
you have no idea what it is to be actually in that position
so i had
it happened to me like five times or six
and it's
oh i hate it
no you you have no idea
when you actually faint when you lose your ah consciousness
it's even worse
because i have been in your
qué te dije
y abrir las orejitas
a veces tú no me has escuchado en absoluto lo que estoy diciendo
déjame terminar
ya te voy a acabar de decir
ah i have felt like you like you have like you have felt like ah i'm about to to lose my consciousness
it's not nice to be in that position
but actually losing the consciousness is worst
and it's terrible
it's like um a small death
pero lo que te estaba diciendo qué era
ah bueno yo veo sangre y me desmayo
and it's so barbaric
and it's not just about our myself and my pleasure but about the blood and and
it's it's it's terrible
tú tienes una hermana mayor
i don't know
i don't know
there there there should be like ah some sort of device to have children
like put them like in some sort of microwave or something like an laughs oven
the the the la esperma y el óvulo
like the how do you say that
in in spanish se dice el cigoto
eh la mórula blástula
i'm just joking
let's see our fetus
i don't know
it would be so unnatural to have a child like growing like a fetus outside the woman
qué es yo no sé muy bien qué es eso de las células madres que bush bush no apoya
i don't know something
i don't want more groans
no
boring stuff
do you ever hear me talk about that like um
read all of them
a p m s lollipop
it it's actually
stevia's good
the natural one
the leaves itself
recently discover i don't know but um the fact is that er might be ah the next big thing to replace sugar or
es carísima
son unas hojitas dulces
que tú las coges
y las secas
y te las metes en la boca y te endulzan
y sin una sola caloría
oh my god
and the spirit speaks about the medium like through the medium
so in that group i i happened to learn about the real espiritismo
like spiritism
tres diferentes
asonde se llamaba otro
pero pero fueron esos tres básicamente
how you call those
estuve estuve en el monte en las montañas buscando extraterrestres
but sometimes i had my my meat
y darle comida a los demás
it's like marketing
they they give away food
they prepare the food
and if there's a homeless guy or someone they have like meetings
and they they they give away people for food
and then you get the soup
just get the soup and then get the bhagavad gita and sing with us and dance with us and
it's a good way to i don't know give someone a a bowl of soup and some i don't know comfort for the soul
we give you food
and if you want to hear about er jesus christ that's fine
like hare krishna
hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare
pero es bonito
eso se supone que te relaja
ellos suelen meditar
y comer saludable
son personas sanas buenas
hmm
sí
estuve en otro grupo que llamaban madame blavatsky h p b
estuve en uno que se llamaba el subuth
que era un poco extraño
y estuve muy poco tiempo ahí porque yo visitaba mucho y no me gustaba y me iba
eh rosacrucismo
no sé
no me acuerdo cómo se dice
y qué otro estuve
el cuarto camino
estuve en el camino

estaba yo muy joven
el de este negrito que tiene el el lleno de pelo grande que hace magia

satia saibaba
saibaba es muy conocido en india
es que en india hay hay más de mil religiones reconocidas
and i became a rebel
and i just told
and i got nothing
i feel nothing
i i haven't got any more faith
so i'm just going to stop looking
if you want to see me just look for me
so i'm not going to laughs look for you
then i became a atheist and then agnostic and plenty of stuff
and then i came here to the u s seven years ago
and attend like christian meetings and christian churches and stuff
and at the end i just realised that i am just a catholic person that wants to be better
and er i don't know i'm just trying to be a good man
no no tengo ni idea qué es eso
marijuana just
but you know what
l s d is totally a chemical stuff
well l s d l s d is is is er is made in a lab
but you know what
still
i told you the other day
er sometimes life is like flat
like without i don't know intereses o intensidades o
could be nice to drink once in a while
like marlboro ones
and for me it was great
but er i never tried any anything else
yo sentí cosas que no sentí jamás de otra forma
um what it is to drink
different things
but what marijuana marijuana made me feel nothing else would have made me feel
and it's just marijuana for a couple of years
and i stopped doing it
but still i know that there are some ways to feel things in life that just flat main basic emotions are not going to make you feel
and i i wanted to have faith but er
but you know what
i am actually one of the
i don't know
i consider myself a useful person a nice person that has been doing nice stuff for people all his life
so i'm a good citizen
but um i have been better than other people that have faith and has done bad stuff
si yo tuviera más fé sería una persona más mejor tal vez más feliz pero bueno
pero un día de estos me gustaría probar algo una sola vez
and something that is going to make me feel something different and nice
exciting
something
i don't know er an experience out of myself
something
and i i have heard that l s d can make you feel like that
i i might never do it but

esa whispers
pobrecito
i felt bad for it that he said that
at least he recognizes that it's true
awful
yeah
the only thing i feel bad because it's the second person already that has put me in that position
i feel really bad because the other day antonio calls me
oye tú que estás en eso

que i have un pariente that came from cuba
and he was a doctor
and i go to antonio
and no i'm gonna tell antonio

he can take that diploma and shove it up his butt
here it's worth nothing
and antonio goes
oh my god are you serious
i go
yeah antonio
i go
listen
i'm licensed in the state of florida
i'm not licensed anywhere else
if i go to california
i either have to take the test or hope that my scores are valid enough for that
so i'm not even talking about the country
i'm talking about the frikking state
come on
like i was like and then antonio se quedaba así
he goes
oh my god because what do you think in in the field of medical assistant
i go
i'll tell you right now
look a medical assistant makes the minimum wage
they work like a dog
and everybody that came from cuba is a medical assistant
and they all think that they're doctors
and not to be mean or nothing but it's an over eh como se dice like um
it's yes it's an overpopulated field
it's really
i don't know like
and i feel really bad
because marta'seng asking me
and i'm like
er
bueno marta er yeah
or you know
i mean it's good that they have that that motivation
more power to him
but the
and i told him
i go
the biggest problem you're gonna have is your english
forget anything else
the knowledge is there obviously
that's good though
yeah no no no that's very good
you're not
right
yeah and he's asking he even asked me to like
cómo
right
no he was even asking marta like
cómo se dice
yeah
yeah
así que tiene interés
they have they have interest
yeah
oh yeah that's great
nobody
not even young people
yeah
yeah
yeah you know how to open your legs
good
that's her talent
america's most talented
lili i don't know if i can
embullado
oh my god lili we both can't walk over there to open the thing
ok i think we both have to walk over there
what do we do
we both have to part we both have to walk
and we should just leave it open i think
ok but
chaquita
she can't hear me
open the door for the dog please
chaquita
just crack it
because i'm not
oh there she goes
ya las ha
that's perfect
thank you
because now we're trapped
look
sí sí sí just to
oh because she wants to see what's going on
so ok so says
oh está muy embullado
he's a little bit friendlier
está de
why because was he's a little bit
but he was a little bit like serious before
i don't know what's going on
oh my god
well but to a certain degree i mean he has to kind of have that presence because of his position
i mean he can be
part of a group
what do you mean he's a writer
published
oh
but like books about what like
like like novel or
really
i didn't know that shit
i would like to
just to see
i think you told me that
what are they
very interesting
all the percussion percussion
yeah yeah
yeah he has
yeah
and
he's like donald'seng
and you are
oh my god
speaking of that you know the other day tommy and i well we didn't get into a fight or anything but he pretty much told me that i have to change my ways because i'm so harsh and that i don't
yeah but
and i i almost started crying and everything
because i was like
but i don't understand
how can you say that
i don't even realize that i'm doing that
but he says that i'm harsh
and i thought
but i don't realize that i'm doing it
and i even told him
give me an example so i can cut it out
i mean i don't know
but you don't even realize that you're doing it
and you don't realize the power of your eyes
and i look at him
and i go
the power
and i go to him
the power of my eyes
and he goes
you could sit there and say
hi how are you
but your eyes are saying i don't know what
and i'm like
but i don't i mean i know when i make faces
for making faces
right and you were smiling yeah
yeah
right
well that's
no i didn't say anything
well that's what
well you don't realize
so anyways go back to the you he tends to look at people like that
i don't think that's a
is that a bad thing
well i think and i've i mean i i do this because obviously i think tommy is much more quiet and observant
and i think people like that are
i don't wanna say that they're smarter or more
i think they're a better judge of character
it's a talent
it's um
we can't
we're too social
you know what it is
but it's not in our nature
but um do you want to
i like i like to be i like to be madam butterfly
remember that
remember laughs
i want to
well yeah even though the other day i told the patient something
and i was like
as soon as i said it boy i was like not didn't do good
but you know what
hey
i said it
what do you want me to tell you
well it wasn't anything bad
like now
with the los viejitos
i told you that right
so there's
you know we've been getting a lot of viejitos
whatever cool
pero hay una vieja que es
pobrecita you know she's alone
and you know how it is
so every time that she goes for therapy she'll ask you a thousand and one questions
that's her social hour
pero
you know if you had one patient
but you have ten fifteen patients going at a time
i don't have the time
and no matter how much i really want to sit there and answer her questions and not be rude i can't sit there and answer especially when they're just redundant questions
when they're just
oh my god is she really asking me this
so she starts
no porque cuando voy voy a ver el médico otra vez
we've already told you this mind you
i forgot her name
fulanita esa te dijo que in four weeks
pero yo no entiendo
y si yo me siento mal yo no lo puedo ver antes de las cuatro semanas
bueno of course
but do you feel bad
are you having an emergency
what's going on
right
no no no no no pero imagínate
porque yo no me siento mejor
you've come for three sessions
i don't know what to tell you
i told her that
yeah i told her
tú has venido a tres imagínate
eso no es magia
quisiera yo que fuera magia pero no es así
que yo lo que quiero es ver
whatever
she starts giving this whole thing
yeah yeah
no and then she tells me
and they did x rays
y los las placas ya están
you know how they normally give you like the sheet which the guy the doctor actually has to interpret and say
we found a fracture
we found this or whatever
i go
no eso se demora una semana
porque yo quiero ese papel
so look i go
for your
i mean she can get it
it's her personal records
and i go
ok for your records
no because i have a a friend whose a doctor in cuba
aquí no es nada
pero es un doctor en cuba
and he's gonna tell me what i have to do
because that just riles me up
like there is no
it bothers me
so of course i i did the whole
and i go
ok
y qué lo que ese médico te está diciendo
ese hombre que te está diciendo
no porque él piensa que me tengo que operar
i go
ok the doctor that saw you here is a board certified orthopedic in the state of florida not in cuba
here
here
and he didn't tell you that
i don't understand
is it that you want to be operated
i mean is that
yeah
i no i asked her
i go
es que lo que tú quieres es operarte
sí
yo de verdad que pienso que es la única forma
i go
bueno imagínate
yo creo que entonces está
no
and ah and so you know
and i told her
bueno imagínate
yo creo que está en un lugar equivocado
porque cualquier médico que sea bueno lo último aunque sea cirujano lo último que va a hacer es operarte
porque uno
even a surgeon
and you know this very well
they're gonna do all the conservative treatment
let's do pills
let's do this
the last thing they wanna do is cut you open
ok
it's probably
yeah and we're not talking a thirty year old woman
we're talking an eighty year old woman
yeah
so i told her that
i told her
fíjate bien
y y tú le vas a creer
and i told her
and i said
that's where i pass the line
i told her
tú le vas a creer bien mejor a una persona que no tiene licencia aquí o a una persona que estudió aquí y tiene licencia aquí
quién tiene más valor
no pero ese hombre es mi amigo
i go
no i understand that
i understand that
and i respect that
but you have to understand too
bueno para que fue eso
and i was like
oh shoot
i shouldn't have said that
because it's not my clinic
it's not my
but you know it's like
listen
that it that really riles me
that really riles me
and you know she's an older but she's an older lady
so what can you expect
bueno
so tell me about the old tell me about the old guy
viejo
you and the team
oh my god he wants to be buddies with the guys
he's a smart guy
you know why he's doing that
but you know why he's doing that
you know why he's doing that
no but not only that
not only that
but not only that
i can't beat them
i mean not that they have anything where
i'm gonna join it
i'm gonna let them know that i'm one of them
and they're gonna take care of her for me
because they like me
yeah he's very smart
i'm the daddy
that's funny
ok so you go to have breakfast
and the waitress takes it off
i mean
how do you know that
no
oh my
that excited
that excited
yeah
she probably thought you were kidding
she probably thought you were kidding
she probably thought you were kidding
make us a coffee
qué pena
they were embarrassed for her
oh my god
because he had been there before
and he had sensed it
yeah but him him
everybody goes there ok
so he had kinda sensed it
and he was like
oh my god
but she's like an older lady
his age
ok but she's cuban
and she looks not great
i'm like
ok but she doesn't look great
she looks like she looks like her age or probably even more
ok yeah
he must be loaded
he must be loaded
that's the sugar daddy
because you know i say that too
when i see like a young girl or a younger girl with a guy
no i know but
yeah that's the thing
you don't realize you think
no i'm thirtyfive
i'm fine with it whatever
you think that everybody because you know me and we all look the same
but when you meet
because i know it happens to you
today mismo
i did an evaluation on a man
pobrecito he's only been here seven months from cuba
and you know over there they just don't got the nutrients and stuff right
so they don't look good
so i'm evaluating this man
mind you i i just get his name and his diagnosis
i'm not looking at his age
fractured wrist
i start talking to him
the man starts
no porque llevo siete meses
still not looking at his age
i did everything i could to him
after
i'm thinking he's pushing fifty
after he leaves
i go to write his paperwork
born in nineteen seventy two
and i go like this
oh my god
and roger'seng behind me
and i go
oh my god
and roger goes
what happened
and i go
roger did you see that gentleman that just left
a new guy
and he goes
yeah
i go
guess what year he was born
roger was born in nineteen seventy
and he goes
i don't know
i go
seventy two
he goes
oh my god that man's like my that man's my dad's age
i go
i know right
i go
are we totally like our our perception is out there
because you know we think that we're cool we're young and hip
because everybody that you know that's your age more or less fits the bill i think
so when you see someone it's like short
does that happen to you with the shortness
like i i know that i'm short
but i don't realize it until
until either i'm standing next to someone very tall or i see someone very short
like the other day i was in publix
and i i just cracked myself up
i was there pushing my little cart
and from a distance there was a
she must have been philapino or something
the lady was like this tiny
she was like this tiny
and i'm as i'm pushing the cart
mind you she's far away
and i go
short whisper
and i'm doing the whole to myself
as soon as i walked by her she was still shorter than me
but couple of inches
and i thought
oh my god is that what i look like pushing the frikking publix cart
because i don't feel that that's what i look like
i feel that i'm walking around very tall and proud
right mm yeah
yeah
and then you go
and you're taller than
yeah
well because i think either they know you already
they don't associate
or your personality
he's five eight five nine
yeah
a little smaller
yeah he's not
he's average
yeah he's normal
yeah for
well not really
jeff was six something
that was extreme too
yeah it doesn't
no it's still good right
right
yeah
your presence
your presence
yeah
right
and i think it has to do with if you're used to seeing someone in cariño
it's like um
it's kind of like with andrew
i know andrew'seng huge
but i've known him for so long
it doesn't shock me any more
it doesn't surprise me any more
it's normal
it's
you know what i mean
it's almost kinda like it's normal
now if someone points it out to you
you go
oh yeah yeah
ah whatever
or maybe you see someone out in the street
and maybe they're not even as fat as him
and you go
oh my god that person's huge
es cariño
i think it's just you get used to it
right
because you see andrew
and you know he's a big guy
but you're used to it
yeah
he's a big guy
you just say he's a big guy
he's a big guy whispers
and then you see some really fat guy
and you go
wow that guy's fat
and then you sit there and go
well
so oh my god
so let's go back
i don't know if the story
but i'm gonna say it anyways
ok
i think i told you that tommy'seng friend that really tall guy
the awkwardly
well he's not gringo
he's
right
he saw jana
and he was all about
yes
ok
so we went to the heat game
and the whole thing right
ok very good
then a couple of days later
he
by no means
yeah yeah
yeah he's eating he's in the cable
he's in the
he's in the cable
it was ten dollars
i mean it normally runs like twenty or thirty
but he i guess he went to see all of it
it's still a cute little gift
i mean it was it was a very cute sign
it was very cute ok
so this is the thing
so about a week after the heat game whatever he calls up tommy
hey i'm gonna do a barbecue in my house so everyone can come over and hang out
and tommy
so tommy goes
ok yeah we'll be there
so tommy hangs up the phone and tells me
oh my god this guy's gonna do a barbecue at his house
and i go
ok so what's the problem
tommy has been to his house one or two times previously when the guy was still married mind you
that the house was super tiny
and it was really piggy
right it was really piggy whatever
so tommy tells me
oh my god this guy's gonna do a barbecue
imagínate tú
and me da pena
i'm not gonna tell him no
what am i gonna tell him
he's living alone but in the same house
because it was it's his dad's house
so the chick left
right
he has the kids
i don't know where she went
but whatever mumbles
so anyway
no she's hispanic
she's hispanic
so he isn't
he's cuban
he's cuban
he's cuban
he's just blond and blue eyed
or green eyes
so anyways
so tommy says
oh my god i'm not gonna tell him
qué pena
you know
i can't go to your house
because you're a pig or whatever
and i'd much less eat there
so
yeah yeah listen
you need a help
so anyways
so of course he calls jana
inviting her over
so she goes
this is where the whole i turned into
that's what marie tells me
she goes
oh my god but you've turned into
i called jana
and i go
hey are you gonna go
and she goes
yeah of course there's free food
yeah i'm going
i'm going
i go
ok great
i'll meet you there
we're gonna go like around three or four
not really
this was briefly after the whole heat game
ok
so
yeah
on the way
yeah that's really sad
you know what's gonna happen yeah
so ok so i tell jana
listen i'm gonna be there like between three or four
it's a barbecue whatever
ok what are you gonna wear
and i told her
i actually thought of wearing like one of my cute summer dresses
but at the end of the day it's this guy's house
whatever i think i'm just gonna wear little bermudas
and you know call it a day
oh i just bought this little i just got this little um like summer dress from old navy
because i went to go buy shorts
and i'm too fat
and
ok yeah
she calls me like at three thirty
we're in the publix nearby buying stuff to take to the frikking barbecue
she calls me
hey i'm here already
oh my god i can't believe i beat you
i go
bueno we're almost there
we're in the publix
right
enter yells
maybe chaquita did or somebody did on their way out
i don't think she knew she would know how
i think you can disconnect yourself for two seconds
what a great
but was it somebody knocking or was it them playing
oh yeah yeah now yeah yeah now there's knocking ok
i told you
he's having a blast
he's having a blast
no pero remember they're on break
yes
sí él está él está está bien
él está bien
ah sí mira
hablen con este muchacho que está de lo más interesante
he's smoking
and he's drinking
él es inglés
pero sabe español
pero why why do you insist on the plastic cups
i don't understand
oh my god bueno
so jana calls me
oh i'm already here
right
so i i go to her
well we're in publix down the street
we're buying things to take
did you buy anything to take
so yeah eso me puso
ya eso me puso a a you know whatever
so i had a
ah whatever we show up at
we'd sip beer
and i took turkey burgers whatever
she's there sitting there whatever
as soon as i walk in that we go to the house
ok this is what happened
it's not in
but it very well should be
it's a house
yeah it very well should be
it was a house
it was a normal house at one point in time
and it's owned by this guy's dad
so apparently he got slick to the game
he divided the house up
le hizo a car port or whatever
dos efficiency
so this guy lives on like this side of the house
and it's like this
and i don't know how many bedrooms it has maybe two
three pushing it
then next to on on the same little side is two efficiencies which happen to be rented out to family
parientes whatever
exactly
um
i wanna go
so um and they even divided up the fence and everything
no no no está
it's horrible
it should be in i'm telling you
bird road and like the turn pike
ay
deja si quiere la puerta
abre un pocatico
sí porque ya
allí
so
so bueno
so we get there whatever
she's sitting there
as soon as i walk into the backyard sure enough i see a dog
and the dog looks familiar
but i'm not sure
and jana goes
oh look this is my dog
i brought here
and i turned that's where i turned into apparently together
she only has one dog
she only has one dog
it's a mutt that's a mix between a boston terrier and a
i don't remember
exactly
so i do this
i do this
and i tell her
she doesn't know this guy

pobrecita the dog is a puppy
it's barely a year old
and it's a super hyper active dog
now it's imagínate it lives in an apartment
so now it's in this a backyard the size of i don't even know who
and she brought it little toys to play which ok is understandable
but now the dog wants to play
now the dog wants to play fetch and catch and the whole thing
i'm not gonna play with the dog fetch and catch
i came to a barbecue to have
yeah
so now the dog is
you know i can't blame the dog
the dog brings the little ball the little bone
it wants to do this
it wants to do that
and i'm like
listen
get away from me
sí porque no me recogiste la casa
yo me fui para allá para despertarme
varias veces
por la mañana
oh
y y went into the room looking for you
dónde está papi
yo yo no sé
está afuera
no i i did that one
and i'm starting to work on my my the sentences paper with the last one which i'm doing on cyber loafing
no for beckerman so i can be done with it
there's a post in six and then there's a the last paper
which is an ethical issue in your organization
oh for due is the the work
yes
there's a chat
april ninth
you found the liner
the ponds
right
what did you have there before
well i don't think it really matters
i've never noticed which colour it is
that's what's important
oh you didn't tell me
how did it go yesterday
at church
as usual
mhmm
so he likes her
you need to bring him by to win her over
yeah it was just lack of experience
for the stations of the cross
oh great
what about your mom has to be there for the easter vigil
ooooh
i'm gonna try to go and stay as long as i can
no
sleep there
yeah well ask her
it's very good
i only had uh
i bought french vanilla cream because that was the only one that they had at b j'seng
ok i'm gonna go to my school
i need to give the tickets to the other teachers for the stuff that i turned in
and i'll take paco
when the house is picked up
oh ok so then you can stay her finish picking up the house
why don't you take some tylenol
i put it next to your side of the bed
gordo is sick too
no
i don't remember him kicking me
so he must have been facing me the whole time
i slept pretty well
yeah i must have slept well
um yesterday the principle called me in
she goes
i wanna talk to you before i i speak to that teacher
yes
and um and i go um
i wanna
i wanna speak to you before i talk to her because i want the union to be ok with this
and uh and i go
ok
and so i go to her
yeah well you know let me know about about what's going on
and she goes
no i'm telling you what i'm planning to do because you know when when she comes in she's probably gonna be upset or whatever
she might come to you
ok
she came back to work
she came back to work
yeah you know i was mentioning that you know people talk about the catholic church and how um priests that molest children like get transfered
but but the school system is about just about the same category then
because her dad is an attorney and her brother is an attorney
so they're more scared of the lawsuit than they are of ethical things
yeah
because the the parents didn't do anything but the parents are more concerned and took them out took the kids out
imagine that's a free program
you know and so anyhow um she goes
she had come to me the principle had come to me a couple days ago and she goes um
the person that you sent me an email and the resume do you know them personally
and i go
truthfully no
i know her boyfriend
um i know her via email but you know because you know we've gone back and forth
then she is in a position where she wants to
la novia de
the manager of payway
but he but he
she's in belair
she's in belair
she's in fifth grade
e s e
well that's exactly what she needs over here
pero ella no quiere traer a alguien
tú sabes she goes
no no
because she's been working there less than three years
she has to get that approved
she you know it's the bureaucracy
it takes a while
so she goes um
i need the person that i have up there now
no da la talla
you know i mean i need to get rid of them
and um i need to bring in somebody else
but with that other person they're already in the system
so it's gonna take a long return
even though they're in the system they're somewhere else so it has to get approved by the district the the the change
even if
the principal
you you remember what i went through ok
and so she goes
because i had told her if she comes back what we need to do is don't put her in don't put her in that classroom put her in a higher grade you know where kids can talk and kids can talk and kids can tell you exactly what's going on
and so she goes
yeah but i think she's only certified for pre k
entonces estamos you know stuck with her
entonces she um she goes to me
no but i need i looked up her her stuff
and she is k through six pre k and k through six elementary
well perfect
and she is emotionally
no no we don't have six grade
fifth grade
they will eat her alive
of course eso es lo que tú quieres
um le dije
la unión me va a botar porque yo no estoy
she goes
i go no
eso pero es que
yo le dije
eso es lo que tú tenías que hacer desde un principio
yo sí pero es que yo no sabía que ella estaba you know certificada hasta hasta quinto grado
ay mi amor ella es una principal nueva
you know
ella está
tú sabes
she's great
but she's new
ella no se sabe todavía cómo access the things or and how to you know
she goes
she asks people
you know er the person that gave her the position or whatever
and told her
listen look at what she's you know certified in
because that's what that's the first thing i had asked her
what is she certified in
put her somewhere else
but i guess she hadn't really done any until she you know somebody told her how to do it
entonces yo le dije
ahí sí que no puedo haber decir nada porque si es un una decisión administrativa
si a mí me cambian mañana de first grade a algo que yo no quiero
quinto grado como me hizo la principal de de la otra escuela
eh she has every right to do so
ahí it's her administrative decision that i would do best in this class
whether i like it or not that's i mean they should take that into consideration
but they don't have to
they had a sub
well she requested not to have the people that you know made the allegations in the classroom
and she said
look i've nowhere else to put them
so she obviously felt very uncomfortable working there
but then that's also something that um our principal told er la principal me dijo me dijo um como ella er me había dicho que ella quería no estar con esta persona yo le voy a decir que mira como tú te sientes que que piense que sea por ella
yo dije
perfecto
así ella piensa que tú le estás haciendo un favor a ella
y ella no va a dar la talla para eso
porque ahí eh me lo dijo
oh yeah
they're emotionally you know disabled
pero le dicen hasta alma mía
entonces por eso la otra no podía
e s e is really really really difficult
y más cuando when you have you know kids that are the violent ones los que
ah entonces la cosa pasó que ayer durante
ella tenía una reunión
like a c s t it's like a it's it's a child study team
so she was meeting with some parents and a counselor whatever
so she wasn't in the classroom
y entonces um quién me vino a decir eso dios mío
yo creo que fue pili
me vino a decir er no que uno de los niños de la clase de ahí de ella lo encontraron en la calle descalzo running through the street
entonces figúrate
la principal les cayó a ellos
y dijo
pero qué pasó
entonces la principal fue adentro de la clase er que you know to find out what happened
how could this child just walk out
entonces habían dejado había there was like an electrical cord that didn't keep the door from closing all the way
the child snuck out
yeah from her class
and um the the child snuck out
so she the principal went in there to try to see how could this happen and how to prevent it from happening again
porque dice que the person that found two people that found
you know figúrate
around the park people walk around
you know so they found this este es un niñito chiquitico sin zapatos
because it was nap time
er corriendo por ahí
entonces they brought him back dice que que el señor was a vietnam veteran
y dice que estaba hasta llorando
porque dice que que le recordó a los niños er en vietnam you know running with the bombs and stuff and barefoot
and and you know dice que que estaba you know he was really traumatized with the whole thing
figúrate it looks horrible on the school
entonces um she goes
i went in there
i was talking to the aids
y tú sabes dónde estaba la dueña
i know she was in a meeting during that time
she goes
yeah but it's her classroom
she estaba recogiendo como si no fuera nada con ella
she was
si es tu clase donde algo que pasó con tu estudiante tú no vas a estar ahí presente para que no ocurra de nuevo
sí
no she doesn't
of course she doesn't
y ésta no es la primera vez que le ha caído esto arriba
en otra escuela o sea yo yo le había dicho
eventualmente ella se va a ir
pero le va a tirar ese problema a otra persona
ahora es ahora la cosa es que in fifth grade e s e ella está en el building de nosotros donde ella puede estar constantentemente vigilando
y tiene personas al lado
y ella seguro que le va a decir a las a las maestras de al lado que que sean bien vigilantes you know
um y además de eso ella puede estar constantemente chequeándole los
because ella ella es un desastre
she doesn't have plans
she doesn't have you know she comes up with things al último minuto
ella no toma eso en serio
pero yo le dije
perfecto eso es lo perfecto
porque yo le eso es lo que exactamente lo que yo le había dicho a la principal desde un principio
y yo le había dicho
tenemos que meterla en una clase para acá
donde podemos estar
y ustedes tú sabes caminan you know en la clase lo que sea
entonces yo le dije
oye a mí no me van a botar
nos van a botar para el carajo
she was
you know because sinceramente la unión es secundario
para mí lo primero
es los niños
y además eso es lo que dice el contrato
que the primary purpose of the educators is the student
so i'm going by the contract
el que me diga
pero además ella no está haciendo nada
claro las dos sabemos que lo que queremos es que se vaya para el carajo pero
pero ahí sí que puede ella documentar
porque ahí ella sí que tiene que tener las cosas bien organizadas
she already resigned
then she hasn't resigned
yes
yo te digo sinceramente
er yo sé que emily really wants to you know work there or whatever pero
for you and for her
porque qué pasa con las cosas de pedrito
te vienen a ti
qué va a pasar con las cosas de ella
right
so
y y paul es muy muy hot headed
exactly
exactly
there's always openings in
but yes unless you have during the first thirty days or first day they have the option to you know if they see that you you are really bad they can throw you out
within the first thirty days
cuando estábamos en la clase el sábado was talking about that
it was a teacher
yeah i know
that there was a teacher
that they had you know done a whole bunch of things
i know exactly who they were talking about from you know from the school i was at before
and i go
did you get hired somewhere else
y esa maestra no hacía nada
se sentaba en la clase tú sabes qué a comer y a organizar la cartera
er entonces le preguntaba a los muchachos
are you sick
are you sick
and if they were sick and they were out they would ask them
what did you have
oh no i you know i i had you know a stomach virus
oh a stomach virus ok
she would come back and say
no she's sick
and she goes she she would er ask for worker's compensation because she got the stomach virus from a kid in the class
espérate
that's not the worse
y se robaba cosas
ella yo la cogí una vez going through my desk y mirando cosas
yeah no not here
at the over right
right right right
y ya me lo había dicho mi hermana
me lo habían dicho varias personas
cuidado no dejes nada de valor porque ésta se lo lleva
así que a thief
er no y todavía está en el sistema
y entonces cuando ya had done everything because it takes you have to document those things for a long time
ok
cuando ya él lo tenía todo la principal dijo
no a mí me da
tú sabes
era la otra principal no ésta
ésta la hubiera botado antes you know
si le caía mal no la hubiera hubiera botado
they have to
here they give you the opportunity to put you on a a an an improvement plan
and if you don't improve then it takes a long time
a lot of bureaucracy
right
tienes que tú sabes
invita a a alguna de las celebraciones
y díselo a sister porque si él le gusta ella y ella y ella
tú sabes se caen bien
right
i'm still having coffee
ve a buscar algo
pastelito de queso
de coco

y lo dejamos ahí como baby sitting
oh
and my cyber loafing paper
i have six pages
it has to be ten
so i need to come up with more
what ethical
come on you've you must have done it something like that person coming

yes but
i got my grade the day after and i posted my thing during class

look at her
she's making faces
to me apparently
i've i've always been partial to older men
ah
oh no that's not legal
no that's not legal
that's not legal
although i have skated the twenty one mark before
i am proud to admit
but that's fun
chaquita wait

this one didn't have a picture in it
ok
don't worry about it
dale
sigue
i'm telling you guys right now
it's nine fifteen
you better settle down
turn the t v on
do something quiet
i have no idea
i don't really care
honestly as long as
she that little boy has only been here for a month
a month
yeah
a month
no we're talking about that little boy
he came february second from cuba
yeah they just landed here
and already he's learned to play wii
and they're they've been playing for an hour
yeah marco goes
i taught him
i taught him
although i'll tell you marco'seng spanish is not that great
he really let it go
but then on the other hand tosca'seng spanish is much better
she's also ambidextrous which is interesting
and then that's also the same thing that i think influences um she has a little bit of dyslexia
and i think it's all related
that's what i think
she's still in the learning stage
yeah but
no but like you tell her twenty and she'll put zero two
yeah
and and there's words and stuff that
and she's also fascinated with things that go backwards and forwards
like she'll take a a piece of paper
she'll do her homework
and then she'll flip it over on the backside
and then everything that the way that it's runs through she'll recopy it all backwards on the other side
ah they're from last summer
they're all
yes
no
i need them
oh my god
bring them up
what are they called
oh my god right now i need them
i was just talking
right now
look because look how rat tattered they are
oh my god
but you know what the problem
you know what the main problem with the shoes is
no
they're extraordinarily comfortable
first of all
and second of all they go with
they go with my coach bag
they go with everything
they do go with everything
but they most importantly i have a coach bag that matches
i can't get rid of the shoes
but i have to get them
oh my god for sure
oh my god for sure
i can't get into the whole white shoe thing
well though that's really
yeah but that's an exception
but other than that really white shoes are for viejas
no but not those
no but not those
those are spectacular
those are beyond fansy shmansy
well anyways so mi viejo calls me today
he tells me that la capitana threw him under the bus
in front of everybody
and he played it off
whatever i mean things are very sensitive right now at work
uncool on ten different levels
so
and that's what i told him
i said
why would she do that
very tacky
but whatever
you know what are you gonna do
so i go
well you know we'll keep it quiet
he freaked out
he played it off
he neither confirmed confirmed nor denied
and he just you know
he left it like that like
oh well where did you get that from
and left it at that
now
the you know so i i i talked to him about it
but he's so funny because a couple of people have told me that they see him más más embulladito
like remember this is
yeah
this is a very quiet
hold on
this is a very quiet guy
you know
hold on marta'seng calling
dime
no no ellos están jugando arriba
pero cuando quieras vení
oye he tried the asparagus
he tried the spinach
he ate cucumbers
pobrecito yeah he did
he wanted to try everything
lo que he did not like ranch
está peleado con the ranch dressing de mala forma
he doesn't want to have anything to do with the ranch dressing
he calls it la pasta esa
that's what he did call it
he goes
la pasta esa
yo no quiero saber nada de la pasta de esa
he calls it la pasta esa
and he will eat the vegetables with out it
but the ranch dressing ni para ni para
and to me the ranch is the best thing
bueno dale ok bye
yeah but remember
but remember they're not
a mí no me gusta la pasta
but remember laughs
oh there's a new one
we're supposed to watch it
pero remember he's not accustomed to anything that has seasonings or anything like that
because flavors all of that is completely foreign to him
did you see that his father goes
oh what what is that
asparagus
he's never seen asparagus before in his life
i mean asparagus is a very distinct looking thing
what
the important thing is is that i think that they all came con los patines puestos
i don't know if you noticed
i don't know
because here it's worthless laughs
you have to start over
florida
if you move to another state you have to start
yeah
take the test
yeah take the test
the state
no you're right
está explotado
but i mean the way i see it is
if that's what he wants to start with and continue more power to you
more power to you
but did you notice how he's already uttering words
i thought that was uh i'm i'm very impressed
that's why i told him
i said
you know right off the bat i could tell that you're the kind of people that are gonna be successful wherever you go
because
so
they are
they are very like
what do i have to do
what do i have to do
where do i have to go
sign me up
and not just some of them
but all of them
like you could tell that
and you could tell also that he's a modern man
like
oh where's your wife
oh no she's over there
signing up for english classes
who do you know that comes here a month later and signs up for english classes
for god sakes
that she's been here since she's was twelve eight years later she has nothing to show for it whatsoever except a baby
oh whoopdedoo you know how to lay flat on your back
how about that
how about that
that's her special talent
how about that
that's her special talent
dammit i didn't know that was a special talent
because if i woulda thought that was a special talent i woulda kept on doing it
i don't know
apparently that's a special talent
well anyways so i told him so a couple of people from work have mentioned que
oh he's very he's very happy happy and this and that
and the change in his personality and
oh no she wants to go out
oh no
oh no i don't know
yeah
yell to chaquita
and see if she can open it
open
open the door a little bit
just open it así así
just like that
just like that
so she can go in and out
just like that
and now and mire la was just to stick her head just to have the door open
and that's all it was about
yeah
everybody's noticed that he's happier that he's more conversational
very quiet
very serious
very serious like intimidating serious
like one of my coworkers is still very like wow
but then when he stays quiet and he looks at me i wanna like go under the table
i wanna hide
i wanna hide
i'm scared
and then um and j d makes fun of carlos
carlos le tiene miedo
carlos le tiene miedo
míralo
míralo
míralo
and j d imitates carlos
it's hilarious
oh my god
in his position and
not just his position but let's let's talk
he's a writer for god's sakes
he's written two books already
apparently not
but apparently
like i think like novels
i i have not had the luxury of reading them
so would i
he plays three instruments
drums bass and guitar
now i didn't factor in factor in twenty six years of law enforcement with rank at that
hello i mean the guy has a hell of a resume
right
and now and now you you know and now you add the forty five years
you know
and he pretty much he looks at people that way very
and
and you are
and you're here to see
right
and you're lucky if he might even speak to you
uh oh
oh we visited this before
i think i'm much harsher than you are though
but when are you harsh
uh huh
you know what you have to do
that's what it is
it's the facial expressions
you know when i was in the academy
your eyes are saying something else
well i will tell you what
when i was in the academy i used to get in trouble for that
for making faces
because it didn't matter if i had learned to shut up
because my face said it all
i would sit there and go
and then the instructor would go
miss do you have a problem
and i'd have to go
you know
and it didn't matter what i was saying
because my face was saying something else
and he does the same thing
he has this he has this poker face
i don't know
he has this poker face all the time
but he's definitely mastered the art of of being quiet and observing
it's a talent
it's enviable
i want to learn
we can
but we can
sometimes
it's something that i think i wanna i wanna do it
no laughs
oh madam butterfly
madam butterfly
i wanna do it
when and and you know what though
i think that in my job i have to center myself more than in your job
said it
you were like
ah ah
oh no no
what was it
ay
pobrecita
that's her social hour
pobrecita
reminds me of something
go ahead
oh my god
but they can't stand the limitations
you're not supposed to feel good at this point
resultados
she wants to see the progress
and he wants to look at them
why does that even bother me though
it bothers me
in cuba
probably
and you would think that's a last resort
that that's something that somebody would wanna avoid
no
yeah it's the it's the last resort
until
right
it's the last thing
no especially when it comes to things like that
because that's
you're not removing a tumor
you're talking about things that are more sensitive where you have the probability que no va a quedar bien
right
yeah who do you prefer
está bien
yeah but the ignorance the ignorance is unbarable
the ignorance is unbarable
mm
so yeah so a lot of people have noticed
and even we went to have breakfast at a place where we usually eat breakfast by ourselves
but like
me and the team
but he wanted to join us
well i think
no he is
yeah he's levantando la pata
no he is he's doing the like the dog
he's marking the territory
so i'm gonna join them
i'm gonna let them know that i'm their friend
and that everything's good
yeah they're taking care of
right
and i'm the daddy
and i'm the daddy
no he's very he's brilliant he's beyond brilliant
yeah let me tell you
he suites me
bueno it turns out that the waitress has a crush on him
bueno short of taking on off her clothes and sitting on his lap
para qué
she couldn't even take our order right
i've never seen her that enthralled by someone
oh excited with
oh my god ella está
loca
and when i told her
oye ese es mi novio
i came back in the afternoon
no it took me like twenty minutes to convince her
no no espérate
let me rewind
no no wait
start the story from the beginning
ok so we get to breakfast
she can't even take the order
even j d and carlos were like
métete en la cocina por dios
por dios
they were they were screaming laughs
and they were like
my god what is wrong with this woman
they were like
we've never seen you like this
and i was like
oh my god you're not kidding
this woman has a crush on you
and he told me
we go there all the time
sergio'seng
yeah he goes there all the time
we go there all the time
everybody goes there all the time
that's the hangout
no ella está enamorada
yeah well she's about his age
yeah
she's no she's columbian or something
she looks her age or maybe a little more
yeah yeah
and it's so funny
because he tells me
he goes
oh because you look twenty
he goes he goes
you don't look thirty five
you look more like twenty five
you know
and he goes he goes
oh and there when we must go out people look people stare at you
and they must wonder
what is that girl doing with that viejo laughs
yeah but i don't think he looks that much older than i yeah
and i don't
and i guess at the end of the day i don't realize that i i really don't look my age
but
i think i'm fine
yeah
in my age group
right
we all look the same
right
tenido
and you're thinking he's in his forties
yeah
he's thirty
yeah
yeah
oh my god
no as far as i'm concerned i'm cool and hip
i don't know but
but i mean think of it
i i think i'm big

here what is this
i know laughs
well i wanna know what this is
porn pictures
no it's gone away
yeah
i think it's coming into the light like from the darkness to the light
no so this is what they do at at at navarro
yeah
oh oh wait you're right
manolo
manolo es flow watch
so sí hay un range ahí
donde los policías practican
y y la gente que están los trainees the police trainees
they do it every day
so when you come here don't be afraid if you hear it
because you know they're practicing
really
pero aquí no se oye mucho
when
cuando yo estoy entrando aquí sometimes i hear it
but it's not so loud because the range is all the way over there
which is great
i imagine if we were right there that would be a problem
but there's a lot of distance
so i don't think it's a problem
that's a good idea
but they have like like little dummies
and i think you're supposed to like target them or something
yeah
entonces si caminas un poco más if you walk a little further you'll see they're building and like an exercise path for the police officials or police trainees actually
entonces tienes que brincar tienes que ir
sí exactamente
entonces lo tienen ahí entonces there's a lot of construction going around here
so i asked what was happening
and they said that the the the corrections is coming and also f b i
exactly
exacto uno nunca sabe
y todas las chicas aquí son bien inteligentes
they're very smart
and they all have background in what they do which is broadcasting videos
and like actually recording
and editing and all that stuff
and it's gonna be great trying to learn from them because they're all experts
so i'm kind of looking forward to doing that
exactly
well yeah they're good trainers
so i i have faith that i'll be able to do it eventually
y entonces allá entonces en el en el edificio cien
está la command staff
ahí está el lieutenant
ahí está el major
so for instance i report to the lieutenant
and the whole place reports to the major
they report to different people
but he's the one in charge ultimately
aquí hay una muchacha que se llama ana que she's very sweet
y entonces está encinta
y y no va poder venir she's not gonna be able to come in for another seven months
but everybody reports to her
but i i report to the to the lieutenant which is in the command staff
she's so beautiful
she's very young
una muchacha bien joven bien bonita
y muy capacitada
exacto
no that i know
well you you have a lot of experience being a laughs
you reared us all
you had six of us
and you put us all through school
a mí me ayudaste increíblemente
i probably could never have done anything without you
thank you sis
and now you're putting carmencita my daughter through school which is not an easy task either
and your children too
no todo está malo
exactamente
y
and my daughter now is using you know
i got her the phone as a protection when she goes to school whatever she has to call but they're text messaging
exacto
i'm looking yo lo yo lo miro
you don't you haven't checked at all
so when do you plan to
you porque tú no lo puedes hacer you can't go to it and start checking this
his his phone
porque el teléfono mío no el teléfono mío tú sabes
bueno tú tienes mucha gente que te quiere
but it takes time it's very tedious
fíjate que en mi teléfono tanto que yo marco que ya se me está acabando en en the face of my phone
it's it's already smeared
see look the number eight it's like it's all messed up
carmencita is really fast
carmencita is so fast on that on that email or the text messaging on her phone
i think so
and they do this all day so now
and was telling me that since she is so close to that phone that another way to get to her so she behaves is say to her
you know if you if you miss behave
because you know she has a tendency with her friends and everythings
then what they're gonna take the phone away when you get name from school you can't text message
and then then she says how quickly she's gonna be behave because she wants to do it
but it's a a at least it's a suggestion
but what do you say
you you have psychology
what what what's the best way
yeah but what about the stuff that she's doing negative
how do you take that away
bueno por ejemplo
por ejemplo hace dos días ella estaba bien bien grosera
she was extremely nasty
so we're gonna punish her this weekend
she can't go out
she she could go out
but she can't be with her friends which is that's a real punishment
you know puede ser
to be with her friends not
well i think the fact that she wants to be with her friends every weekend
and if and i'm not letting her do it this weekend because she didn't behave
i don't think she'll be she'll be nasty again
you do
ok let's try
let's use it as a as a test
training
so que tú dame un ejemplo
vamos a suponer que tu hijo te cuenta te contesta mal
qué tú haces
for how long tú no le hablas
pero cuánto
un minuto día o hora
yeah but like if he but if he answers you nasty
and he goes into his room
claro
dios se lo bendiga
that was nice
que te dijo eso
because you plan to what
bring in the rains
exactly
pero yo i don't remember armand dating except muni
did he when he went away you didn't see him
pero a quién más he dated here
aquí nunca salió con nadie
he did
yeah ahora carmencita likes to stay up late too
but she's like on the computer
or watching t v
that's ok
it's kid stuff
you know you know weekends whatever
and during the week también yo últimamente la estoy acostando más temprano
pero no es fácil because she doesn't wanna go to sleep
and her friends are text messaging her
está cansado
cómo estaba en eso he plays everyday football
so it's a football team for the school
wow that's interesting
really
wow so that's good that he's part of it
so what position is he in now
did they
he's like defence i think
i don't know much about i don't know yo tampoco conozco mucho football
i know
exactly
i know because you don't want to him to break anything god forbid
yo tampoco
swimming i i should have learned how to swim
i regretted so much
but when you get older you're over the hill
perfect thing to do it when you get when you're younger
como carmencita se tiene que aprender
let's talk a little bit about carmencita
mother insinuated that i should put her in camp this year
i don't think so
i told her i rather pay you and you take her
because
yeah
because mother was saying
because mother maybe because mummy no la puede cuidar
mamá no la puede cuidar
yo entiendo
pero a mí no me gustaría ponerla en camp por las amigas
the further away
y qué hizo el muchachito
se estaba tranquilo
no hizo nada
y qué hizo él
pobrecito no
they don't
pero gracias a dios carmencita no está en eso
no yo no he visto
entonces las otras madres me dijeron que tampoco está que la están mirando y tampoco está en eso
yo creo que hoy la voy a sorprender porque ella va ir al parque hoy she's gonna go to the park today
and i leave at four which is great
i love the hours here
from eight to four
well there gonna be times i have to stay like when they're doing stuff
you know i might have to stay
but that's not not everyday
and sometimes when they have graduations i have to stay to help them whatever
but that's not every day
so like once every two or three months
yeah
yeah
but today she wants to go to the park because i told her
i let you go today to the park
friday saturday and sunday you gotta be you know doing your
you've got when do you think you're gonna finish your project with her
tomorrow you should work on it the all day
i know she is
did you do
but i didn't see any of the research under the three people or the four people
not enough
and i think the pictures looked too big
she did
really
pero las fotos vas a tener que hacerlas más chiquitas para que
pero cómo si no te puede flip
really
ok
that's fine
exacto
i don't know sister
thank god that you're a teacher
and praise the lord que you know what you're doing with her praise god
so due tomorrow can you just work on it
do you think you can just work on it all day with her
if you finish tomorrow then you're home free with that
but then there's a science project
you already know more or less what you're gonna do with her
how long will the science project take
no i know that
i know that
nothing
but they they're ridiculous
did they tell you when the science project is due or not
no this is due
this one's due
but when is the science project due
maybe in may
so did you wanna take a break
or did you wanna start doing it
no you're gonna you're gonna start the science project too
ok so but finish this one first
and then work on the science project with her
the science and this one
well finish this one first
this one's due
yo le dijo que ella que ella tiene que darle muchas gracias a dios que te tiene a ti sister porque tú eres una mujer muy muy educada
y eres maestra de profession
and you know what you're doing
kids don't know
they don't know whether they're coming or going
it's a joke
sí pero these teachers assigning these projects the kids don't even know if they're coming or going
what do they expect
so getting back to carmencita
do you wanna take care of her for the summer then
and i'll just give you something for that
i'm thinking
it's like three months right
so er
well maybe you could take her
i'll give you the money for that
tu hijo
qué tú quieres que haga
y este año no puede trabajar
are they cutting back personnel pues no hay dinero
él tiene dieciséis años ya
él puede trabajar en la biblioteca también
sería un buen trabajo then
los libros
what so what did you have in mind for him
you want him to work at publix in in in the street there ninety fifty street by the house
i could go help you
i could go talk for you
not that you can't
i mean you do it because you talk just as well
y qué te dijeron
we can go
and find out
we can go and
because i'm when i'm there i can enquire for the summer
like what hours
como todas las horas tú quieres que él trabaje
pero a qué hora más o menos like from eight to or nine
nine to
nine to four
that's good
day
i i can ask i can ask
when i'm there next time i voy a hablar con el manager a preguntarle
he's sixteen years old no
it's a great location
exacto
y al lado de la casa
it's not too far from the house
maybe they can teach him how to be a cashier instead of a bag boy
but you want him to be a stock boy
if he were if he did a cashier
but cashier but you know
do they no they have some guys
i don't think i've seen a guy there
do you want me to have requests
yeah
do you want me to request to see if they can train him how to be a cashier
no i know
cashier
if not then what is it left the stock or there's the deli
to make sandwiches
oh really so you've done your homework
te conoce
porque si se cortan
puede pasar algo
the machine
pero i thought maybe instead of the machine then he likes er baking
but you can't
you gotta be eighteen
he loves it
le encanta baking
what did you think about the the brownies
qué rico
you don't like sweets as much as i do
i mean i love sweets
no yo sé
no no not at all
we don't
none of us need that
really
yo no sabía
you should tell that to carmencita because carmencita loves sugar
we're gonna
tienes que decir
sí pero tienes que decírselo
sí esa parte yo no sabía
maybe now for sure
that will cure me big time
because i love sweets
really
eats a lot of sweets too
have you spoken to her lately
cómo está bien
cuándo vas a ver el apartamento de ella
tienes que ir porque te vas a
no but you gotta go sis
i'm not kidding
you have promise me you're gonna go
go with carmencita this week coming up
no you have to
yeah go with carmencita
yeah maybe you can teach her how to swim porque tiene que saber
y eso
pero mira a ver si le puedes enseñar porque lo que pasa es que todas las fiestas ahora del summer people are gonna learn people are gonna know how to swim
and she's the only one who can't go to the parties
she a drag not to know how to swim man
hay que saber hay que saber porque estamos surrounded by water
you know

that's all you have to do
that's ok
ella come lo que le gusta

eventually
yeah eventually yo creo no sé yo creo que ella va a comenzar a comer mejor
that's good
that's very good
yeah
yeah
es que hoy en día como uno está tan ocupado
yo cocino en veinte treinta minutos
pero with the help of a lot of people
for example you know like for instance today ya yo tengo rosetti
it's just it's a pasta that's stuffed
all i have to do is heat it up put the sauce on top a little bit of sugar
and i have a meal with a with a salad
yeah it's stuffed shells
so that's one meal
so when i say que yo tengo ayuda de otra gente quiero decir que i use frozen vegetables laughing

they are allergic to water
they never wash the dishes unless of course i say
you know what
i'm on strike
y no voy a lavar hoy
ahí que se queden las cosas
oh they don't like when i say that
i say
how would you like it
just because i'm a housewife i'm always washing
i'm gonna get arthritis god forbid
no es que me duelen los dedos de verdad
yo fui al médico
y le dije
you think this is arthritis
me dice
no parece que sea arthritis
yo le dije
pero doctor i have a terrible pain in my finger
so adrian says it's the kickboxing
i shouldn't do kickboxing
and i love kickboxing
how could you take kickboxing away from me
it's my life
oh my god
i i tell you i wish he would go with me
sí
gracias a dios
i know
yeah
so it's very nice
it's big
to start he's gonna take one
and then maybe eventually he'll have another one
bueno es el negocio de él
eso es lo que él él sabe
él sabe digamos de accounting
or how much he's gonna make
and he calculates todas esas cosas
when it comes to running a store and that's his expertise
that's his business
i mean i can
yeah
advice
dios lo bendiga
tú sabes él he knows his business
and the way he conducts himself people look up to him
yeah
he is serious
pobrecito
oh
oh you know a relationship goes through a lot of different phases
you know
i'm trying to sell i mean rent this house
ay no quieras saber
i'm going crazy with it
no not yet
eso le queda
that's terrible
so anyway do you have your condo
el condo que tú tienes ahí
and the beach
cuánto tú tú arrentas ese lugar
el condo
es dos cuartos
sí pero el mío es mucho más limpio porque está todo limpiecito pintadito
el edificio o el apartamento
right
so they are gonna put they are gonna put they are gonna put they are gonna put in your unit
they are gonna they are gonna fix your unit too
really
see that's what luis says
he says it's horrible
i know i know that he's gonna see one
en el condo
we are supposed to go see one today at six
because he has to move
he because the because the owner can't afford it
it's in for closure
so the owner but the owner hasn't told them anything
but he got the letter from the attorney
i don't know
pero parece que hay otros lugares en el en el mismo lugar que a lo mejor va a ser más barato
porque él está pagando dos mil ahora
so he's figured prize
he says you know what because we could get it for a lot cheaper so called them
y le dijo
ve para acá porque hay un edificio el agua y todo
vamos a ver cuánto quiere
si el tipo quiere dos mil dólares le voy a decir que no
you know aunque yo no lo pago
lo va a pagar luis but you know still
i'll ask him today
i think he said que se iba a mudar a un condominium
but what happened
he he is not he is not retired yet
i know
if i if i was his age and his money i would have retired
pero es una estupidez
he is almost sixty years old already
how old is he like
so he should retire and be happy
who cares about the income
he he he he is fine
he should live he should live
then he would retire
tienes mucha razón
no if they respect him that's good
yeah
well you are never gonna retire because you are gonna live a hundred and twenty
and then you have carmencita'seng all of middle school elementary
so one more year
then you have middle school
and then you have high school
praise god
but you are gonna have like a your like a warehouse or something like that
de producto
are you just gonna get the royalties
that's good sis
yeah do you remember that that stupid guy i was recently dating
he was saying that he uses gloves
pero que las manos le sudaban mucho
eso era lo que tú estabas patentando verdad
sí
so entonces eh i think it would sell
but he's not the only one
and what did he say
and what did he say finally
yo creo que sí
anything that you decide to do sis is very intelligent
to flourish
you are very good
is gonna work for the rest of his life
because of the insurance
el insurance está carísimo
tú te acuerdas cuando yo dejé de trabajar
i went on cobra
it was it was ridiculous
it was about a thousand dollars for carmencita and i
a month
so how do you do it so that you can retire
you really cannot retire
yeah
most housewives would say that about their husbands
go to work honey
go to work honey
yeah
that's er
no no he is
he is
you know like luis you know luis just if you just feed luis and give him his television he is happy
yeah
and i don't really have to feed him
he'll say
what do you want me to go get you
so it's not like i have to cook
exactly
yeah laughing
exactly
the other day he was shocked that i said
no i'm gonna make you filet mignon
you are
are you feeling ok
pero no lo molestas sis
si él se queda así eso sería un milagro de dios
él vino aquí el otro día
conoció a a a lola
yeah
so we'll see lo que
yes he is
oh te dio yo no te di la carta la carta
ah sí
yo estaba haciendo otro para carmencita
enseñamelo porque she's gonna need community hours
sure
she needs them now
she needs them now for her no sé qué
she had a good over a hundred hours of vodka
so i made that up
and i'm making him sign it
yeah
so
oh please is right
they don't even you know how to even feed themselves
no y tú viste que quiere ahora mi hija caminar sola al parque
le dije que no
dice que con con veinte niños y y two or three parents
maybe si van dos o tres parents and like maybe ten or fifteen kids
i don't like it either sis
trust me it's the hardest job
it's very very hard
that's why i rather her being with you for the summer
piénsalo bien
mañana habla con ella
you know i figure i can give you maybe two hundred dollars a month
do you think is that too little
and then and then and then two hundred dollars a month for you and two hundred dollars to to do whatever
so it's four hundred dollars a month
two hundred dollars for the expenses
you know the food
well no two hundred dollars for her expenses for the food for the movies wherever you go
i think two hundred is ok
ok or we could that way
you could just you could maybe that's another way of doing it
i give you the money for you
and then whatever you spend you tell me
like we do with the stuff
alright that would work
because i yo no quiero
es que mamá fue como que esta mañana se lo dijo
you know empezó
mother told her or she told her
did mother bring it up or carmencita brought it up
tú ves entonces se me va a fastidiar a mí porque es mi hija
con las amistades
no yo no quiero que vaya al parque
no but i don't prefer it
and i'm the mother
if we can keep it controlled sis
no no you got to
entonces mira yo mañana tú mañana vas a hacer proyecto con ella
mañana mañana es viernes
ella no tiene escuela
ella no tiene escuela todo el día
tú si terminas la
tú crees que puedas terminarlo mañana
it would be great if you can
well
sino you are gonna
no she's grounded on saturday too so
but i would
psychology
well maybe that would work
if she finishes all her project on friday a lo mejor el sábado ella puede salir
or have a friend no salir tener una amiga en la casa
tampoco yo no quiero
ok so that'll do good
well i've never in eleven years i've never punished her
sure this is my first time punishing her
tú sabes que yo nunca le le he dado un punishment a mi hija
éste éste sería el primero en los años de existencia
no
no
entonces vamos
that's a good idea sis
and then next week monday tiene que hacerlo los dientes
te voy a dar un blind check
ponles los braces
ponles
well she wants some
she wanted it on thursday today
she wants you to take her today porque she wants to show it to her friends
no todos los niños los tienen
it's like a fad right know with the kids
and she wanted right away
she said that she's not gonna give you hard time ni nada
que no va a llorar ni nada
so ponlo pónselo
y entonces
ya
she's big now
oh yeah no she's very smart
she's brilliant
she's smart kid
and she's very well loved
they love her
doctor loves her
pero she needs a braces up here
aquí va a tener uno
what
but why you go back into her mouth and do it again
ella no me deja
ella no quiere que ni le toque el pelo
ni que le toque los dientes
no quiere
antes que te vayas quiero que te enseñe
si tom no está ahí que te enseñe la parte cuando ella está caminando conmigo en el
ay no
she is growing up
of course
moses i love you
i love him with all my heart
lets catch lunch
how about eating some fish or something
that's where i was yesterday
i went to a fish restaurant
bien rico es colombiano
but they would they would
yeah but i eat fish
i mean you can have what ever you want
but i mean i was just eating fish
bueno y qué tú crees de de aquí la cuadra lo que están haciendo
la rotondita esa do you like that
no
no pero
el de entrar o el de salir
bueno ese está en la intersección
ese tiene bastante espacio
lo malo el otro yo lo veo más difícil porque es más más estrechito
no
sí los los bloquecitos esos
sí
en lo que hicieron de concreto
pero y pero eso lo que va a ser como un pedacito de de de tile ahí
pero yo no creo que eso sea mucho speed bump
eso más bien yo creo que lo que va a hacer es como un adorno pero
baja la velocidad ahí
sí la van a asfaltar
bueno
sí sí sí no tienes tienes razón
el asfalto era
el asfalto era para que lo hubieran hecho primero
hubieran limpiado todos los leftovers de asfalto y toda esa cosa
entonces después haber sembrado la hierba
haber recogido
limpiado
y ya acabado y eso
pero bueno ellos tendrán su idea
aquí atrás
no no me he fijado
no no no estaba estaba estaba en la puerta
cuando salimos que nos íbamos para el bicycle shop
estaba puesto en la puerta y yo lo tiré para dentro de la casa y nos fuimos
y ahora les ya vi que lo había sacado de de la maleta
pero no me había fijado no me había no me he fijado qué cosa hay dentro
y se ha está rico el tiempo
sí
esta terraza déjame decirte que vale el precio de la casa
espacio
una hamaca
no
ahí se pudiera poner sí
yo tengo una que cada vez que nos vamos camping we take it
and i set it up in the in the campground
pero no aquí no se nos ha ocurrido como aquí lo que pasa es que the the ground in the back it's slanted
it's not even
so that's something to
pero sí se pudieran poner un par de tubos o algo so we could uh install the hammock
yeah
it's really really nice
when it gets to july and august it gets hot
you gotta wait until almost the end of the day
that starts cooling off a little bit to be out here
at at at three thirty four o'clock it's fine
bueno we
eh we had a hard time finding the house
because we were looking for a house in miami lakes on the lake without the pool
and that's that made it very difficult in nineteen ninety eight when we bought here finding that
we couldn't find it
we couldn't find any house
they all have pools
and then we came across this one
que la estaban estaban vendiendo desde abril
el viejito se había muerto
la estaban vendiendo desde abril
habían bajado el precio un viaje
y entonces como en agosto que nosotros encontramos la casa habían vuelto a bajar el precio
y entonces negociamos con con la hija de lucía la señora que vive aquí
and we got it pero
a house on the lake without a pool is almost impossible to find
yeah
yeah
y ahora vamos a hacerle el baño
porque el baño está el baño original
eh we are gonna redo the bathroom
ah my idea originally was just to leave the tub
y change everything else
pero ahora the new idea is gonna be that we are gonna to replace everything
change
no we are gonna put a tub a tub but a new tub
because it's gonna be very hard to leave an old tub
and then match everything else to the old tub
so kind of a
we are gonna redo redo the whole thing
cambiar las paredes quitar las paredes poner la los dry walls esos nuevos
que no deja que que no asome la humedad
que ah eh eh son como waterproof
y entonces también
eh llevan los las losas los ladrillos los
hasta arriba hasta el techo
sí ahora están eh más o menos al nivel de la ventana
y hay lugares que alrededor del del inodoro que están bajitos bajitos
entonces llevarlo hasta arriba
después que hagamos uno posiblemente hagamos el otro
y ya entonces ahora quiero eh los regadíos the sprinkler system arreglarlos y
empezar por retirarnos
hoy fuimos a ver un camper un r v
sí
sí porque este the one we have is nice
but it's fairly small
and when you get to the place you have to actually put it up
and and open it and put it together
the other one no
the other one everything is in place
you just get there
press the
and
you don't even have
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yah the keys are getting very
right difficult expensive and difficult with
it's very hard to find a camping spot spot over there
right they close them
they close american outdoors they close a a bunch of them
yeah
yeah
and the campgrounds were beautiful places to build on
because they were huge pieces of property a lot of them right on the ocean on the water
so you know it was a good deal
so they closed them
american outdoors was a beautiful place
and they just closed it down
viste
la coneja de pepita
cleopatra yeah
yeah that's
when pepita moved to tampa she acquired the rabbit
y that was her companion
no
it's a dutch
i don't know something dutch
yeah
yeah
esta she got it
yeah
that that real real pig los los los with with a big belly
yeah
how cute
how is everything at the hospital
sí
yeah and less money
yeah
yeah yeah we've been three years without a raise
because
they take it away
sí
así mismo nos pasa a nosotros
that's it yeah
yeah
sí
ahora one advantage i have is that pepita since she is working for the county she's gonna be independent
i'm not gonna have to carry her in my insurance any more
because she'll have her own insurance and for her working for the county the insurance is free
and for pepa is free
and i pay if it's just for me it's just like thirty dollars a month
no that's not bad pero right now
no because if we go into the family plan her plan is more expensive than mine
that's why i had it
i had the insurance under me for pepita
and me because pepa had her own
but now that pepa has her own and pepita is gonna get her own then i can get mine on my own
it's thirty some dollars which is not a bad deal
yeah
pero
pero you know i don't agree with him
in two thousand and three that the taxes were more or less what they are now
right
that was five years ago
the salaries of of employees and the hiring of employees have not increased what they increased in revenues
so where is all that extra money that they made when the when the boom was going on
tú sabes
it was misspent
ah they bought things that maybe they didn't need to buy
they made
tú sabes
let's bring it back to where we are donde estamos ahora
tú sabes una una cosa básica lo lo lo necesario
contéstalo contéstalo si quieres
así hablas un poco
es un estudio para la universidad
se acabó
they are still playing
la mitad nueve
sí
qué edad tiene cincuenta
yeah
saw an american film
sí
sí
you are still at hospital right
hmm
yeah
yeah
no no y
right
it's not worth it
it's not worth it being on the streets
no vale la pena estar en la calle como está la calle hoy
donde quieran te roban
er te asaltan exacto
la del chili's sí
sí
no is is is not is not that that that's actually unincorporated dade county
that's
no that's unincorporated no that's incorporated dade county that's dade county
dade county unincorporated dade county
it's like what we were before
before we became a town
we were unincorporated dade county
the subdivision was miami lakes pero it was unincorporated dade county
then we became a town
they are not a town they are not a city
they are just unincorporated dade county
that's carol city
carol city pero
carol city is not a city or a town
it's a subdivision
como miami like we were
right
tú sabes
pero cuando se refiere
no
unincorporated dade county
no no no miami gardens doesn't come across fifty seventh avenue
that's sixty seventh avenue
if you are gonna call that anything eso es la zona de palms springs north
eso es lo que le llaman que no es palms springs north because palms springs north empieza en la setenta y nueve que es el para allá
así que esto es un pequeño pocket que hay ahí
que
er le llaman le dicen miami lakes because es la es el pueblo o la ciudad más cerca a donde está le dicen miami lakes
tú sabes
sales a hialeah sales a hialeah
yeah
we are getting our own zip code tres tres cero cuatro
tres tres uno cero uno cuatro
bueno pero supuestamente el cambio viene en que er tres tres cero uno cuatro va a ser miami lakes
no sé
pero eso lo dijo
er
right
sí
sí pero fíjate eso no es una cosa que tiene que hacer el town of miami lakes
eso es una cosa que la tiene que hacer el gobierno federal en la parte de del del post office del correo
ellos son los que tienen que hacer esos cambios
y supuestamente they are in the process de hacer ese cambio
de cambiar del correo de que tres tres cero uno cuatro va a ser solamente miami lakes todo lo que es miami lakes lo que está dentro de de el town de miami lakes que incluye del lado de allá para el metro royal oaks ahora es miami lakes
y eso ahora no es tres tres cero uno cuatro eso es tres tres uno cero cinco uno quince
es otro zip code
entonces ese zip code lo van a cambiar también a que sea tres tres cero uno cuatro porque va a ser miami lo que está dentro de la ciudad de miami lakes
es eso
eso fue lo que yo oí y lo que dijeron
si lo hacen o no lo hacen
sí
er pero bueno
ah sí
sí
para que le den los quinientos pesos sí
sí son las ten forty or ten ninety nine
ya a mi hermano se lo hizo mi padre
sí porque ellos normalmente no hacen income taxes porque están retirados
sí
exacto
ella se lo está haciendo ese es el campo de ella
ella es an accountant
y ella es la que le hace
si acaso hazme hazme cuando tengas un chance hazme una copia
de cómo se llena
esa exacto
porque yo sé que le hace
de que es retirado o algo de eso
sí
es igual que cuando uno manda los cheques al i r s
hay que poner el ten ninety nine con el número de social security y toda esa cosa
que si no no lo aceptan no no es que no lo acepten si no no te lo acreditan los los tienen que acreditar
ya creo que falta poco para que se acaben los treinta minutos no
no sé casi casi la media hora ya
sí
hay que cocinar
ya cocinaste nosotros comimos nosotros fuimos a bass pro shop
bass pro shop
allá en grifeny ninety five
eso que es cuestión de casería y toda esa cosa
y cuando salimos y fuimos a a county a ver los los muros los campers
porque andamos para para el futuro buscando uno más grande
y de ahí salimos
y nos metimos un barbecue place que hay er university and pince boulevard
allá traen una cosita chiquitica
pero cocinan tan rico
yeah yeah
yeah yeah the whole barbecue smoked barbecue so
it's delicious
y we were there and pepita asked er we asked her what she wanted for dinner
she said well bring me some ribs
so we brought her some ribs so
she said she said i'll i'll i'll have them for dinner
so got here she ate them
and i said i thought you were gonna wait for dinner
me dice no no i'm hungry i'm gonna eat now
so she ate so
ya hoy pepa no tenía que cocinar
jennie is the little one
yeah
sí
yeah
todavía ahora acaban estos días
ya empezó el spring break
sí yo no sé qué día empieza pepita pero f i u está er
they tried to stag
tú sabes
so not all the kids are out at the same time
yeah
yeah
and we get a lot of kids from the outside
that come from northern states er
yeah
although before it used to be fort lauderdale miami where all the kids came down to
now they are spread all over the place
they go to jacksonville they go to panama city
tú sabes different places
the keys the keys
lo que pasa que the keys er
for er er er college kids es imposible
yeah
yeah
ya pero
right
er yeah
yeah
pero everything else it's cheaper at the beach than in the keys
like restaurants transportation you know
ah in in miami beach er they go to burger king they go to mcdonalds in the keys you don't find that much that too often
so if they have to go to regular restaurants es caro
tú sabes algunos de los restaurancitos esos um er in the keys er no son nada del otro mundo pero te cobran te cobran más que un burger king o un macdonalds so for kids is not bien bien práctico
estoy mirando el reloj
yo creo que hemos hablado bastante
está bueno el aparatico ese que tiene la grabadorecita esa
sí
er los otros días sacó office depot unas tarjeticas en venta
las de esas de one gig two gigs
yo fui y compré una para mi cámara
pero yo uso la regular la s t
pepita en la cámara de ella usa usa una que se llama dualpro o una cosa así
que esa nunca la habían puesto en venta pero por fin office depot las puso en venta
y ese día tenían una cosita de estas en venta también
un sandisk que es un m p three m p three player con con un recording un radiecito f m todo una piececita
estaba bueno
pero cuando llegué nada más que tenían el el de muestra
no tenían ninguno allí
to record not any more
yeah
bueno
that's that's er
tú sabes opens the door for a lawsuit si pasa cualquier cosa
tienen al maestro grabado un maestro que diga cualquier disparate en la clase sin querer o queriendo tú sabes lo tienen grabado
es todo lawsuit todo lawsuit
todo es un problema todo
oh for sure
que fue la que le dieron de lado
increíble increíble
duro
pero tipo s u v o
un carrito
imagínate
imagínate
no
los p t cruisers no vienen con airbag
como un rebuilt
ya tú sabes
sí
sí
are we
are we are we on time
keep on talking
four more minutes five more minutes
pues sí lo de chili's está impresionante no verdad
el tiroteo ese ahí en chili's
y los otros días el tiroteo en el colegio
y ayer o anteayer el el riot en el edison
en en el otro
esto está calientica la calle
y dónde fue otro también lugar aquí también que tirotearon
los otros días aquí pegaditos nosotros
no pero er estuvo chili's
en chili's habían robado y habían tiroteado a alguien hace unos días atrás
y ahora se formó un tiroteo de nuevo
pero había otro lugar más que había habido un un robo un tiroteo
la calle está que mete miedo
sí
la gente estaba desesperada para tratar de resolverlo a cualquier costo
estos muchachitos se han pasado todo el día ahí pescando
y compran
yeah
yeah yeah
no they'll be catching catching fish because you see them you know bringing up fish every once in a while
pero ya le está cogiendo la noche y ya se van
no
no there is not
because you know the the thing here is that the lake doesn't belong just to one entity
the part of the lake is the water management district
pero then when you come from like the thirteen feet
that that strip there el canal
is a water management
but then when you come into the lake that's miami lakes
is the residence of miami lakes in that so since it's such a mix they don't do anything
i had a
when we first moved here not when we first moved here
cuando fueron las elecciones de de aquí en miami lakes que se formó el primer viaje
uno de los de los comisionados que corrió
uno de los muchachitos jóvenes vino por aquí
y le digo listen look this is a good thing for you to look at to do
dile que venga para acá
we have usamos usamos este como guinea pig
er
qué te estaba diciendo
ah sí el que estaba corriendo para acá tú ves tú eso
le digo esa basura no es basura de nosotros
esa basura es cuando el condado o el water management district viene y limpia el pedazo de ellos
ellos vienen con las palas
y arrancan toda la basura
entonces caminan tres millas con las palas para abajo rompiendo toda la hierba
y después echan un palazo arriba del camión
pero tú sabes cuántos palazos iban rotos por ahí que los dejan flotando
eso es lo que tú estás viendo ahí
dice no ahora ahora vamos a mirar esto que lo otro
nunca han hecho nada
cada vez que pasa el el condado por ahí con la
sí sí ellos pasan
dos o tres veces al año vienen
sí
un aparato que son los que ponen allá en red road
tú no te has fijado allá en la esquina del aeropuerto del aeropuerto
una un lugar que ponen
eso bueno
esos vienen hasta aquí
ellos caminan por caminando
pero qué pasa
que ellos limpian ellos bajan la pala y van caminando y van rompiendo esa hierba
pero en vez de hacer un pedacito cortico
y llevar llevarla hasta el camión no
imagínate si el camión está parado a cuatro cuadras
tú crees que ellos van a a recoger un poquito y llevarlo y botarlo y regresarlo
ellos ponen la pala y van rompiendo van empujándola para allá
pero lo que hace después
que se se queda toda suelta se riega todo
y cuando el aire sopla de allá o de aquí
toda esa hierba muerta
y yo le echo ahí cosas
y fumigó y eso para mantener la hierba lo menos que no crezca mucho pero con todo y eso
er te encuentras que que los lily pads crecen
y y se mete la basura ahí
y vaya
le echas hoy y a los dos o tres meses ya están de nuevo floreciendo y creciendo
so
un nieto
sí el nieto está viviendo con ella
tú sabes que yo pensaba que los hijos de lucía las las hijas de los hijos vivían fuera de miami
pero este este vive en core gables
el hijo de ella el hijo de ella que es el papá del nieto vive en core gables
porque como yo nunca los veía por aquí ni nada
es posible
es posible tú no te acuerdas hace como dos o tres años atrás cuando primero se mudó ahí que tenía un carrito que lo chocó
que lucía lo tuvo tapado ahí mucho tiempo
er le le taparon le chocaron el carro
y parece que el padre estaba bravo con ellos y no se lo arregló ni nada
y estaba parado ahí en casa de lucía todo ese tiempo
hasta que después de una forma o otra resolvieron
viste qué rica está la tarde
ha bajado ahora está debe estar a setenta y pico grados
está super rica
ya ya nos ya nos están torturando
ya estos últimos cuatro minutos son laugh
y er er las clases son en español

pero te quería ofrecer un salón for yourself
y yo y que
duh my work is so good no i'm kidding
no pero i don't know
she likes my work
so she wanted me to do my
pero ella me dijo
i don't know your plans are
y yo le dijo
well the plan is i wanna get married
a porque bruce dijo y que
a bueno si nos vamos
porque we're planning to go the whole family
his family and my family for christmas on a cruise
for christmas
son doce personas
i know
o sea mi mamá el novio
a porque por los momentos mi mamá no se va a casar porque la hija de él de veinticinco años tiene un gato
entonces mi mamá le dijo
porque ella se iba a mudar a casa de él cuando se casara
y viven él y ella y el gato
no ese es para nosotros
entonces escucha
entonces mi mamá le dijo
bueno how about
y ella le dijo que
i'll move in but you gotta get rid of the cat
ok
mi mamá odia los gatos los animales cualquier cosa
mi mamá y que
aparte de que ella y que
el gato vomita a cada dos minutos en el sofá
y mi mamá tiene que remodelar todo el apartamento por aquel por aquel problema de la esposa la ex mujer
y entonces ella y que
you have to get rid of the cat because if we're gonna get new
sabes y aparte que bota mil pelos
mi mamá y que
no no
entonces
sí entonces mi mamá y que
bueno you know what i'm just get a new like you have to get rid of the cat or or i'm not gonna move in
entonces él y que
bueno entonces le dijo a mariela que tiene veinticinco años la hija de él
le dijo
mira mariela nos vamos a tener que get rid of
se llama apolo el gato
entonces dijo
apolo has to leave
porque aparte él ya estaba estresado porque ese día vomitó tres veces en el sofá
y entonces sabes él le dijo a mariela
we have to get rid of apolo
y que se puso a llorar como una niña de un año
que ese es mi gato que no me lo van a quitar que no sé qué
entonces mi mamá dijo
ok gracias a apolo me di cuenta de que va a hacer un pelo difícil vivir con ella porque mi mamá dice
i'm moving into a house where i wanna be the queen
sabes mi mamá y que
pero no porque es ella porque es su casa
entonces él ella dijo
él dijo
bueno vamos a mudarnos a tu apartamento
y entonces mi mamá y que
ok
entonces él dijo
bueno son cuatro cuartos mi apartamento
y él dijo
bueno un cuarto sería
obviamente él y mi mamá cuando se casen
y sería la niñera con mario
el niñito de un año y medio
y sobra un cuarto para mi hermano y para mi
entonces él y que
that's not really fair porque si vienen los dos al mismo tiempo your kids don't have where to stay
entonces my mom's like
yeah it's kind of true
so
they're like
ok let's rent an apartment
and they were looking into apartments
pero después mi mamá y que
es absurdo
we have two apartments to rent another apartment
so they're like
you know what
mariela said that she's gonna leave some time soon
so they're waiting for her to que se vaya de la casa para que they move in
y sabes ellos vivan en el apartamento porque el niñito vive con la abuela
porque como el trabaja todo el día y eso
everywhere they go se tiene que llevar a la niñera
porque la niñera vive ahí con él twenty four seven entonces
un problema un problema
yo no te conté lo que me pasó en en venezuela
sí cuando regrese de
no eso sí estoy de acuerdo
no yo sí estoy de acuerdo porque siento que mi primo ha madurado in some aspects con ella
y siento que no es antonio pérez
no sé por qué pero me da más seguridad
no
ah
eso no lo sabía yo
that's kind of true
pero yo sí siento que ella sí lo quiere
porque ella se
no claro a parte que
qué haría ella con un niño de veintisiete de veinte años
en realidad si de verdad no lo amara porque coño
i'm sorry
pero antonio ha madurado pero no significa que esté maduro
o sea no significa que esté que ya haya madurado
o sea ha madurado un pelo pero no es maduro como eso
pero
o sea yo lo sigo como que
es una sofía dos
marica
ya
no sé
y alguien le ha dicho eso a él
maybe porque ya le han dicho pues
pero yo no sabía que ella no tenía papeles
like that kind of change
i'm not saying porque pareciera interesada or whatever
me entiendes porque
pero él se va dos meses al
y después regresa
y se queda
and then he goes again for god knows how long
ah mi primo me dijo de ese
qué es todo un un un negrito todo pimp
me dijo
no sé porque él me dijo
viene un amigo mío del
y vamos a ir a laguna
pero hoy es como
y sabes él dijo
no no sé si te gusta la música porque es hiphop
y yo y que
i'm not gonna go porque i don't like it
y él me dijo como que
no bueno
es que el sábado el cumpleaños de de miguel fue hip-hop
y que cambiaron el d j ahorita
y yo y que
no they didn't
a new age thing
like this
i've heard of those things
she's into that now
you know and the other she has a new show about
she gets like ten people
and they have to
i don't know what it is
it it's about basically she give she's giving them money
or they get millions of dollars or something to donate
to a charity of their choice
but that's the whole show
and i'm like
you're just trying to show and promote that you're trying to donate so much millions of dollars right
you have to promote it and make a thing out of it
and then the people who able are able to raise the thing the the most funds and donate it
she gives them like ten million dollars or something
i'm like that does i'm not interested in that you know
i i think what she does is great
it's like bono you know
yeah
pero
whatever

i haven't seen any of the pictures yes
well maybe they can email it to you right
you check your email in nicaragua

oh
yeah
well well if she's not happy with the work fine you know
she could i mean you can understand that you know
everybody has their own level of expectations
but why don't you think just sit down and be like

no thank you
you know in situations like that the truth always comes out
always
sooner or later somebody will slip
how annoying
that's like is like high school
but they're not complaining about you are they
yeah all the second guessing back and forth thing
yeah
oh really
who at work
that's cool
hmm
oh it's michael
ah
hello
hi
i'm here at denny's with my cousin
because we're eating breakfast
or lunch
you don't seem to
i told you i told you yesterday i was gonna go and do this remember
i was gonna do the whole um recording thing for maría's friend
yes
mi entonces ahora you wanna speak spanish
very cute
i told you i was gonna eat at denny's with chloe
but that's it i'm not
no no more sweets
that that's the end of it i promise
no sweets today no sweets
tomorrow i promise
i gotta talk to you about my puppy
she has her her lungs are swollen
and they put her on antibiotics for two weeks
two pills a day
and i have to give her fifteen drops of some fluid thing
he doesn't he
i told him what happened
he he started making a noise
i'm like
yes that is exactly it
and so then he did an x ray out of her lungs
and he asked me he's like
has she been in has she been in an accident or something
i'm like no
he's like
has she you know gone into the pool
i guess asking me if she's swallowed water or something
i'm like no i'm like
she hates the water
i mean god even when i bathe her you know it's like no
so i don't know if maybe it's from before that she's had it
and she's accumulating sitting there
i mean i don't know
one day maybe one day when i took her to the beach
she might have swallowed some water accidentally
i mean i don't know where it came from
so he told me to
huh
no no no no i'm like
it's curable
it's treatable
he's like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
he's like
it's just that her
he he showed me the x ray
it's like a part of her lung
it's so fascinating
like i would i would want to be a vet except i don't like biology
oh and they had to put a little cat to sleep today
i'll tell you about that later
this is so sad
this is why i couldn't be a vet
anyways um
no he showed me a part of her lungs that that in the x ray they came out black
like they were just very dark because they were swollen
and he's like
you see it's like they shouldn't be that dark
they should be more like this
and he compared it to a like a lighter gray area in her lung
so he's like
well we'll put her on antibiotics
and then come back in two weeks
so
he's like well he's like he's not sure he's like he's like you know
put try take the biotics because her lungs are swollen
i i guess her lungs are swollen and making her cough
and so then
what her lungs being swollen
i don't know
i didn't ask him
he's not sure what it is
he told me to to give her the medication
and then see if it happens in two weeks
and then if it continues in two weeks then he'll he'll see what else it you know what else it could be
so
he gave her a shot today so i'm not going to give her any medication until tomorrow
so she's in my room right now
she's sleeping because she's drowsy and stuff
and he cleaned her glands
and then i told him about the about the flea thing
he gave me some pills for the fleas
um it's a pill
you give her one pill every ten days and it kills the fleas within thirty um thirty minutes of her taking the pills
so i gave her the pill right when i got home
and he just told me just to you know not to bathe her now
but um to you know just clean the house or whatever like you know
the usual
he he told me you've got nothing to worry about obviously
so other than that she's ok
i i don't know
i didn't ask him i didn't ask him
um he knew he knew what it was
he knew what medication to give her
so i'm sure he must be familiar with what whatever it is
he's just asked me where it came from
and i told him i didn't know so
because i didn't know i guess he couldn't really
he couldn't assume where it came from so
the coughing
yeah he's like
it's probably because her lungs are swollen
he told me
so he's like
i didn't tell him about the sneezing
the sneezing i really think is because she hits her nose
i mean when i hit my nose i sneeze
so uh she's always launching herself into the carpet
and hitting herself with a paw
and i just think it has to do with that
but i'll mention it
if it continues like severely then i i'll tell him in two weeks when i see him
he took her temperature
she has um she had a hundred and two of um temperature
her normal temperature is is one oh one
so it was a little bit high
so
but he said it wasn't a fever or anything
and she gained like two pounds
so
ok what are we gonna do
um four maybe
ok
ok bye
i dunno
i have to well i need to i have to finish a a drawing for my parents
and so yesterday michael and i
he started telling me like
so but i need him to help me draw detail
because the wall's being constructed
like i know like the foundations and the footings
but i don't know the actual construction
and what what the materials are called
and how to technically put them in the drawings
so he does obviously
so i have to sit with him and do it
my parents are like asking me and bothering me about it
i'm like
i understand
but it's like
look like i have things to do
you know last weekend like i had to take work home for my boss
my boss
so it's like i i don't don't assume that i have every weekend all the time to do it you know
then i have that exam to study for
so ugh
i wanted to go to um eating
what are you doing what are we going to do afterwards
i wanted to go to old navy
well i have to go to old navy to get um carolina and carolina's daughter something
for tomorrow so
i figure i'll find something there in the sale
because i just spent a hundred and forty dollars on the vet
so i have no money
you're going to a party
for work
alright
yeah
do they pay you more for taking work home or no
yeah
yeah
yeah
who the raquel the lady raquel
there's so much drama
you don't need much contact with all this stress and deadlines
you don't need additional
stress
they don't do that thing where you can review her
it could be anonymous
well she's a bitch
did the guy leave that guy that she was
i thought he was leaving to new york you said or something
in a better mood
she doesn't yeah she doesn't bother us
that's annoying
they don't know what it's like to do the work
that's why they ask so much and they
like it happens to me sometimes at work it's like
you know they give me something
they don't even
sometimes they don't understand that it's a lot of coordinating and a lot of you know flipping back and forth
and they're like
oh can you have it by tomorrow
and i'm like
no
you know i can try
but i'm not i gonna lie to you and tell you that it's possible
because well there's just me alone
and it's because they either they maybe once did it
or now they forgot you know that it takes so long how time consuming it is
or it turns out they've never done it so
that's the only problem with my boss
she's
the people that actually those the parties that i work with the school parties my team
they're really good
because like i had to do something for like the bathrooms right
and i had to select tiles
and yes it sounds very easy
but it's a lot of time consuming
because
it's very time consuming because they give you a board with different price ranges
there's group one two three and four and five
five being the most expensive
and then in in the specs like which which is part of your contract you tell them you know
price group one and two are the cheapest
you're gonna use maybe fifty five percent thirty five percent of that
and then the most expensive one group four you use five percent
so i have to make sure that what i'm using has been assigned to the bathroom in that percentage
you know how long
i mean it takes a lot
and then in addition to that
i have to coordinate that with flooring and you know the other interior finishes
i mean there's a lot of work
and i started sketching and this and that
so when i told my boss i'm like
i'm sorry look i know it's taking a long time it's like i'm just you know lollygagging
but she said
no no
she's like
i'm not you know i'm not questioning your you know just whatever
but i wanna get them right once
because when thank god when we submitted the drawings we didn't ask like the tile yet
what we gave them in the spec what we were gonna price out in the contractor didn't didn't bid it out didn't price it
so the so now when we're submitting these new drawings the drawing the the work is coming out more expensive now
but it wasn't our fault
it was that he
he no he didn't bid it correctly
so he comes he comes to the the contractor comes to us and he's like
oh you know you guys use this and that
and i'm like
no
and i stopped him right then and there and i printed out all the drawings and i'm like
i know what i did
i worked on this for a month and a half
you know i know i i mean i
memorized the color line and the numbers and everything i it's you know
and at the end we were right
so i'm like
i'm glad that i took so much time to do that
because now at the end it avoids error
te quieren tener como los chinos eh
are your in your building
all right
we were watching something about that
on dateline last friday
um
no taiwan
nike
for an eighty five dollar pair of shoes that they have they pay one factory twenty dollars
one factory
and within that they divide it within the employees
the most an employee who works there makes there is two dollars
eso eso eso es un pegado
i was like how much
uhhuh
we used to
do you remember my dad's neighbors
you remember my dad's neighbors my dad my dad's old neighborhood
the people that lived
there was a some puerto rican couple couple that lived here
there were unos chinos que vivían aquí
you don't remember them
the father did that
he did it the tennis he was in the tennis shoes business
and he used to come in with the with all these shoes
and he used to be like
look this is nike
se ve it doesn't have the nike check on it
and he used to wear them
and it's the same thing in my eyes
and he used to get my dad like tennis shoes y todo for the to play tennis
it's like it's the same thing
he's like
la única cosa es que no te pagan
no tienes que pagar mucho porque no you don't have the check
you know the nike check on it
a surface uhhuh
uhhuh
had lead
how can you tell the difference
like you compare two sounds
or you you automatically know
like like costume jewelry
so the lead is the heavier one obviously
maricarmen the lady we saw the other day in the park
oh oh yeah
why do they use lead
because it's a cheaper material
what do they use in of that
my god that's bad
you can you can
ahí mismo
people i know some people that can't
i remember había un uno hindú or something that came to
and i was gonna give the girl it was a plastic pen to sign it
and she couldn't touch the plastic
she said that her whole skin breaks out in allergies
yeah so she had the she had to hold like the plastic had a little you know the little rubber part
she had to hold it like that
it was really weird
she can't touch any kind of plastic
that's weird
he did
lo hubiera matado pobrecita
what a jerk
uhhuh
yeah i know people who are allergic to that
paige is allergic to nickel
she can't wear
all her silver and gold jewelry and everything she gave it to me
she has to she can only wear
no wait i'm sorry i think she can wear white gold
she can't wear silver at all
i know that for sure
not even her necklaces or anything
i'm like my god
i don't know if she's still like that
but she was like that for a few years
so i i don't know
i know some allergies you can take like shots of medication
you're gonna come with me
i was gonna go there and the gap
well first old navy because it's cheaper
oh really
oh paula's like
get carolina
i'm like
what size is carolina
like i dunno
she said just get a gift card
no because it's a gift card i have to put like money into it you know
significant money
o k
those are new o k
this is
alright she left these here for you to i guess process them or whatever
whatever her it's she needs to sign it
o k
eh
everything is the same porque we switched it from citizens to universal
everything's been switched
entonces
this is gonna go with with the application to universal this is going to go
and then this is and then we're going to open a new file for finance which is something i think you guys don't have
o k
o k
that's why lo están pidiendo
so we're gonna open new files
o k he only has one one thing so we would do him en los folders más finitos
not we don't have to do the blue
we can do
yeah she she just said yeah para empezar
so what you do is you put the policy on the right and the correspondence on the left
so ya tú sabes aquí está todo junto
we're not
we're and now it's going to be individual
o k
so that that'll work
so
right
which is gonna be a finance folder
you know so that's how this one is gonna be
o k
este se formó
tremenda lío
big time yeah
pero bueno eso eso eso es y después te lo
te lo cuento
entonces también este este se va a tener que abrir in a commercial folder
o k

right
then we do the big one

um o k what else
o k
morales muñoz we just redid again

estábamos todo ripiado para siempre
but it
ella tenía era vieja como ella sola
ochenta y pico años tenía
y la arrollaron con el mismo carro de ella la la arrollaron el brazo
and the arm exploded
la carne la sangre everything went flying out like this
y esto estaba todo ripiado así
me dio una rabia coño
i hated those sons of bitches
i'll tell you the truth
i hated them
and they didn't like me very much either
but i hated them with a passion boy
por eso y eh susie eh susie saw it
i said

when susie saw that i was going after somebody she says
goodbye
i'll see you when you catch them
because i would not come home until i got that son of bitch in jail
i would not come home
i would not come home until i
i would sleep in the van like a bum
i would sleep in my van like a bum
shave in the courthouse and shit
i'm serious
i would take a change of clothing
y y me lavaba los sobacos no shit
and i'd keep on fucking going
no no no
eso es ningún relajo
yeah
oh really
podía ser el viento también
happens at my house all the time
you feel the door como si alguien está tratando de abrir la puerta

muy trescientos cuatrocientos cuatrocientos pesos facilito
i know
you can't afford a t v like that
yeah
i remember dan yeah
oh good
can you do me a favor
go to paypal
because i think that's a little bit more pressing more important right now than looking at some dollar store online
you know how to log in
give me the computer whisper
ok whisper
because this guy wanted to buy the lights to the car the headlights
and he he said he was going to send the money in today
so if he does that's my to call him
at hot female dot com
oh yeah it's a it's a little gay that um that it's at hotmail dot com not hotfemale dot com
i'm gonna i'm gonna hotfemale dot com
then i'll be diez mil at en hotfemale dot com instead of at
eh eh eh
then let's make an account
don't you think that's funny
is it
i see
but why the hell does he put the fricking
why does he have the table of the periodic table on
that's ridiculous
ok no that he he didn't send the money
so i thought he wanted it today
check my email for me
let's see if he wrote to me or something
you know matt has actually asked me about the fish
well he asked me
how are your fish doing
and i told him that the puffer fish had died and
although that was a while back right
he hadn't asked me you know
and he said
oh well there aren't those you you know brackish water
so he didn't the other guy had told him
and then i told him about the box fish that we got
that not to eat it
he said that those are the the they have poisonous swim bladder
yeah well but
ok
your book has shipped
what
detoxify your body
no i don't want that
ok delete all of them except the ones from six gen maxima the ones from two books for you
baby so delete the other ones
don't do that
put delete all
then take them out
and then that one again
and the amazon marketplace purchase no you gotta delete that
yeah
right let me see the one for the two books
i don't think i got a tracking number
because i paid for the cheapest filling eh shipping
who cares
ok
so put it to save
no put it on the school
put it um move to move to school
to f i u
right here move to f i u
alright and then check the other ones for me
just click on it
ok whisper
now someone show me
how we're fixing please
i will do this good
because i have no way of
i'm not gonna
where's the home
er it's a different person
it's a different guy asking
ok because i said
close it
because i somebody asking about how to wire the foglights in the car so that they come on on their own
yep
yeah clear them out
because jared jared says
maybe he doesn't know
because maybe he says he just pays for everything
maybe he doesn't know
but he says that his installer guy got the windows to go up and down with the remote with the alarm
i'm thinking that the the installer just charged them for the for the modules
so maybe they'll go up and down
and he doesn't know
what he's saying that it's without putting the the modules
i think that he's wrong
because
yeah the because the thing is if if they have one
alright
ok
he
i can do it
i can do it with this ones too
so that means that there's a little connection that lets me do it with this key
ok he says that the guy moved the connection from this receiver to this receiver
ok
because there's a receiver in the car that receives signals from this remote
and then it turn it it makes the the the motors on the on the windows go down
he just unplugged that from that receiver
and plugged it into the auxiliary receiver on the on the module for this one
because i can plug in whatever i want to it
the point is i need to find the cables i want to plug in
and plug it in to this thing ok
that's what he said the guy did
no everybody's like
oh i don't know how to do this
impossible
it's difficult
you know what you do is you buy the modules fifty bucks each
and they let you control
and then add it onto this
but then i would have to like run wires through each door
and so it's a pain in the ass to install too
besides the fact that it's you know the fifty bucks each
then installation is even more
it's only let me see
ok let me go down
i didn't know you could roll them back up
mine doesn't roll them back up
but i don't know if somebody says so
yeah that's what i'm saying
i didn't think he'd put a module
because i can't put it up and down
and my car just and the car just goes on
and you know what i noticed
if i had the car
on it won't work any more
the car has to be off for it to come now
i guess it's not designed to work without a start with a remote start
do you want to delete that
and then see what's in my junk
you need to see my junk
yeah click on the arrow next to the junk too
there we go
isn't that just intuitive the arrow
ok you can log me out
good girl
why
let's go to wales
do you think they have lots of whales in wales
oh i i i'm gonna ask him when he gets back
because i think it's funny
i think it's a funny name to call a country wales
what language do they speak over there
see if you know
no laugh
flemish i think it is
i think it's flemish
you know how many languages they got there
hello
no that's from finding nemo
what she was speaking
does that sound a little orca to you
yeah you did everything except what you were supposed to do
well i'm disappointed in you
and now the people in wales are going to find out that i'm disappointed on my fiancé
and they're gonna think that the students from from f i u are not good students
well he he said to keep talking
but it doesn't say anywhere that we can't adjust the microphones
anyways
um
i feel the same way you do about me
and what did she say
so that was the only reason why they said me a maximum of a hundred for the for the fricking chairs
oh come on
that's not our problem
i don't like that
unless you pay
oh it makes sense
because you're going for free but
so then we can't as a wedding party go together looking at things unless we all pay
that's another dozen hundred dollars
that's so ridiculous over that amount of people
yeah but i i
it's over a hundred dollars less
but i don't wanna pay twelve hundred dollars for people to go look at birds
in my wedding yeah it's our wedding day
they gonna look at us
and pay
well anyways i just
maybe because the last time we went it was right after the eragon
and it was all messed up
but i really
we need to go back and see
the gays bo
ah gays bo look it up
why are you talking to your shirt
i
you're so adorable
you know
you know baby don't say bad words
temper temper mister j mister n w a
hello temper temper
hey you keep using bad words
no
no
anyways remember rebecca
that little girlfriend of mine from birmingham
from england
that online girlfriend of mine
i think she either visited wales or she spoke
i'm just thinking baby
comes to mind now
why can't uh can't that come to mind now
we were just talking to this guy from wales
and that maybe reminded me of her
i wonder if she settled
i wonder what ever happened to her
because i
she says she'll miss me
well i don't have her
i don't have her email
i don't think i saved it unfortunately
you know what i'm trying to what i been trying really really hard to find
that video
that's all i was saying that video
i been trying to find it so badly
i downloaded kazaa
uh kazaa lite
and there's another one now
kazaa lite resurrection
because they had kazaa right
listen this is a really cool it's a really cool thing
it's kazaa right which i used to use
it was free
then they wanted to make money
so they started putting ads and stuff on it right
and then they're like
good now you have to pay to use it
so people stopped using it
well before they they make made you pay to use it while it was with the ads and all that stuff they come out with kazaa lite
some guy just hacked it and took out all the
two thousand five they closed down the network
because i think they got sued by the real wow
i said sued
because of the whole kazaa kazaa
they got sued by the kazaa
flamingo gardens is you sure it's dot org not dot com dot com
and in two thousand five they stopped going on right
that's too cute
the ladybug
don't that look scary as hell
and some guy resurrected it
and now it's called kazaa lite resurrection
they brought it back
no actually it says when you click on it it says
kazaa has uh kazaa lite has always been free
and if you paid for this you just been scammed
and no it doesn't have any spyware
it doesn't have anything
it it's like it says
it's this is our number one thing
and it's very popular
it's a nice gazebo
but
wait ok
but what will happen in there
just you and me and the and the priest
and the officiant or whatever
and everybody else is somewhere outside
where from outside around it or in front of it
so a lot of people are not gonna see because of the of the wood
baby i'm just saying
if we're all the way back here would
let me ask me my question
well i never getting gotten married in case you can't tell
i mean if you haven't figured it out by now it's my first time getting married sweetheart
i mean wow yeah laugh
so when is it that that the dog ate the the roger's dog ate the the parrot
they they didn't mean jim right
uhhuh
in a cage or something like just
uhhuh
but what's wrong with the dog
the dog looks so friendly so happy
no but every time we come he's like jumping trying to play with us
nice
he could be a basketball player
how are you gonna tell me he attacks
he's he's he's like laughing and wagging the little stub for a tail that he has
oh
yeah but but you can train him for hunting and be nice to people
hunting animals not people
like dennis
i did not like that movie you know
dennis the menace
the dog
your mother
isn't the dog bigger than your mother
go on your mother i find it hilarious
ok so we talking about the midget dog not bo
not the big dog
because they had too many animals right
no it's not a terrier
it's a it's it's an english dog actually
isn't that cool
it is
no it is
he said that it was
uhhuh
so you had the the the
but she had
he had already eaten the the thing
oh
hmm
but
why is your mother torturing this very expensive dog that her employers own
yeah but it's not your it's not
but it's not your mother's responsibility to protect the parrot
yet is her her responsibility to not hurt the dog which cost a thousand something dollars
and it's roger'seng prize possession right now
which she's gonna get fired
that dog is not gonna die
unless roger shoots him or something
lassie let's go now outside
why
why
so what is roger gonna do
buy a new parrot laugh
and and hope that she doesn't realise
why it's a fricking parrot
it's a parrot up it's a parrot it's a parrot
so what
and the thing opened
and the parrot came out
so then he wasn't that that that strong if just
yeah no on the bottom it's open
ah it's a stupid piece of crap then
and the parrot was not too bright
oh that's right they can't fly
i was gonna say they can't swim
well that sucks
you know what i was thinking
no but no
come on that's a beautiful freaking macaw man
they should they shouldn't let him
you know you tell roger he buys me a pellet gun and i i'll shoot his dog
i'll do the dirty job
or he gives me his mercedes and i'll run the dog over with his own car
uh it's not a bad looking gazebo but
ah i gotta exploit michael
after five thirty it pays seventy five dollars an hour
so then that means we're gonna be done before five thirty with our wedding
our ceremony and everything
well well were you were you planning on paying extra per hour then
so but what happened to the whole sunset and all that stuff
eight thirty for what babe
no get it
when are we getting married
when are we getting married
daylight savings time or not
so we'll may be able to like just have to pay one hour extra
can we throw rice
it's a bird park you get it
it's funny
so i'm sure rice is off limits
well good we we i'm sure if we just pass out drugs then people won't complain about not having alcohol
did they mention anything about drugs
ok so we can have drugs then
that's how we do it down here
i i don't know
we'll have to see it again because i just
no babe for that we can just just you and me
i still don't see why we have to bring another twenty five people
yeah that's a whole different story
but it has nothing to do with me seeing it to consider whether or not i want it to be a venue for my wedding
baby
ok that is messed up
we're going to a bird sanctuary to kill two birds with one stone
yeah oh now i remember what i was going to ask you
do you think when they are listening to these recordings that they're going to listen to both of us at the same time
or is it just me just talking one crap and you're talking a completely different crap individually
unless they put it together it doesn't really make much sense does it
think about it
think about it
if it's just you saying every so often
shut the fuck up shut the fuck
every so often
all on your own
without any input from me it sounds kind of weird
no babe not yet we're not married yet
we're not married yet
before
we should get a pre nup
we should get a pre nup
yes we are
why babe
i wanna make sure when you leave me that i get ninety per cent of your money laugh
we'll make it that if you're the one who makes it
if you if no baby because you're gonna make it big
if you make it big i get ninety per cent of your earnings
sure maybe you'll be the one to discover the you know jesus
why
sorry
maybe you
maybe you'll be the one to discover jesus
i know
my mom your mom
you know what we should do it in
yeah babe but i don't think i don't think we're gonna fit a bunch of people in there
that's a home
it's a house
yeah
i'm just thinking all those birds and all those trees and a lot of pooping on our heads
we're gonna have tents
if they ok i'll wear a white tuxedo there you go
because if they poop on my
i'm not
all right
guayabera
yo quiero taco bell
what concession do i have to make
i am
i'm taking it
oh yeah no baby exactly
but that's why we're not doing it by the church
ok well make sure you tell him not to do all of that crazy you know voodoo bible stuff
i don't want any reading from the bible
i don't
you said corinthians only
that's it
that's all i conceded to
because it's romantic
i don't want anything to do with
god brought you here and god
because i don't believe in that
and so how am i
and well i suppose he's also gonna do it in spanish
is the whole were you planning on the whole wedding being in spanish and not telling me until the day of
well babe here's the thing
they're in america
they need to get with the fricking program
i am not going to do
i am not going to do two language invitations
because then you're paying two different people two different companies to do
no because there's some people like
jessie and and and and davy
you know if the the directions are in are in numbers
i mean it's not like you know uno dos tres cuatro
you know oh
does she mean one two three four
oh my god
are you gonna write well maybe because some of them they actually write the fricking numbers out
put the numbers in numbers
how about that
en números
no because i seen some of them that you know they write out the name the numbers
but then again are we doing this for
are we gonna do this for our family or for us
are we are you and i getting married
or is the family getting a party thrown
i mean are we throwing a party for the fricking family or for you and me
you know i don't wanna do it in spanish
because i don't just don't like it
you like to say te amo
that's pretty much the only thing i'll concede i i'll i'll give
just because you see it as special
i say i love you
and i mean it as passionately as you as you mean te amo
te amo
te quiero
but but i don't i don't wanna do
en en como es en pobreza y en en en
uh stop with the bad words
they're gonna go assuming that all they teach us here is fricking bad words
because you said that nasty word which i don't say
you said it several times already
and it's just it's inappropriate for a for a petite little lady like yourself
it's uncouth
and you are so refined
my lady
you know there was there was a pick up truck called chevy chevrolet camino
yeah i know
but nova you know supernova that's sounds like an english word
but but el camino i mean that's like wow out there
ok
where is it whoops
hold on
this thing fell
ok
why don't we just put like you know one fan at at the end of each row blowing down
i i know
but why don't we do an electric fan that'll actually do it quickly
uhhuh
from my personal experience that is what i've used as a fan the program
i bend it laugh
and i kind of fan myself with it
is that that's not our idea right
oh
could we save money by putting the program onto the face of
ok go
oh yeah
i know
and you can put the actual program on it
that's cool man
what let's take it one step forward then once it's that over
can you have it
ah
yeah but if that's like a fricking piece of cardboard and a and a and a dental dam or whatever
a dental thing ah what is it called
yeah because it's gotta be thick stock
silk is cool
in all the websites i've looked at
but our but that dollar fifty would that allow you to put enough text to put the whole frigging thing
the whole program
wow
cool
well that's why we do it during the cold season
so that and we tell everybody
bring your own sweaters
well why don't we do it on a day of spring where the temperatures will be around seventy sixty five degrees
no not once you have all that crap that you're gonna have on you babe
ok then we'll move it up to seventy degrees
why don't we do it on a day that's seventy degrees out
can't handle what
seventy degrees is not good for old people what the hell is that
they have the perfect temperature they need
how are there so many old people here in florida
isn't this like the the the golfing capital of the world or something for old farts to come
are you saying this because of your parents
well they're older than mine
well sweetheart i like the idea
well you know why
you know why
no because my mother is a fully developed woman
your mother is a little midget with no meat on her bones
i don't know
because my mother has a body
she has butt
she has boobs
your mum is just she looks like a square
and a small square at that
a little stubby
yeah babe fifty years ago in her time maybe she was hot
now she's not
you know same thing about your dad
maybe a hundred years ago he was hot
but now he just looks like a freaking old you know
like the crypt keeper
five years older than the crypt keeper
yeah i know
we didn't go in we didn't go in
well the whole park was
the whole park was destroyed when we went
no it's just
i don't really wanna do it in the spanish monastery
they're they're
they're too uptight
they were too uptight
and then the whole place looks too small

i wasn't here a minute ago you know when you came by
i said

i could have sworn i shut it off
i said
it was on when i got here
i didn't do it
yeah maybe the guy
well because he's been having problems with his
so hopefully
yeah they tried to fix it
so entonces you know i do like the things he had picked up and stuff
y cojo
y i finished that
and i go
my computer's working
so i guess i'm gonna go ahead and go back
i'm gonna answer emails
input all the new purchases that we just did into my spreadsheet because i was able to get everything
like it wasn't the hard drive
it was the memory
so
right so i just went ahead
and um i did all of that
and then i was sitting there
martha was telling me
and it's what it is
even though i i tú sabes
so i don't get any of her things
i guess it's a little bit of that
because ella estaba she showed me a picture of her daughter
beautiful girl
she doesn't look eighteen
she looks older
pero una muchachita linda
i go
ay tu hija es linda
she goes
gracias
a mí
i'm like
o k
y entonces cuando viene trevor i go
show her show him the picture
she goes
she goes
that's me
he goes
sí you wish that was you
pero no de lo más linda
y entonces er that she you know again she's telling me about her stepson
and how
she goes like
we think it's cancer
no he's out
he's been out
but he can't sleep
they have to give him valium to sleep
dice que tiene el cuello así
de grande
entonces they did an m r i the other day
and y dice
and even though it was an open m r i because he's claustrophobic dice que he was
so for a whole hour she sat there with him while they did the m r i
y entonces she tried calling the guy so they wouldn't call him so that she can get the results
the doctor still called him
and told them that he thinks it's cancer
yeah
so
you're awake
ok
go in
in there
huh
we can talk
you can't
go away
entonces um you know she was saying that it was um
you know she tried calling
thirty seven
but she says you know she called the guy
and the guy told her
i guess like they saw her with him
because they are not really
laws says you are not supposed to
but like they know she's the step-mom
and she is the one that actually goes in because like i guess the mom's a scaredy cat
so she's the one that goes in with him
and y él se lleva muy bien con ella
you know her name is not lucy whisper
but ok
and that's that's her daughter's name
go figure
so
martha
unless lucy'seng her middle name
entonces él le dice lucy tú entras conmigo so she left her daughter outside
and she he she goes
so i did what i like to do for a whole hour
she goes
afterwards
it was because for a whole hour she was sitting there talking to him while they were doing the m r i
entonces er today she called to try and get the los resultados
but they must have done other things because dice que the white blood count was normal again
she goes
so it's not looking in
it's not this
she goes
so hay infección the white blood count would be lower this and that
she goes
but apparently they think
so entonces she kept telling the guy
please call me
she gave them the cell phone the work number you know
apparently he ended up calling her
he the guy er her stepson called her
and said um and said that the doctor had called him
and he she goes
he told you
she goes
yeah
she goes
i really tried for them not to tell you
i wanted to be the one to
and she goes
but you know what
that doesn't mean it's true
tomorrow when we go to the biopsy that's the one that's for real
you know tomorrow for the biopsy that's the one that really counts
but apparently he doesn't want his mom and dad to know
i guess not yet
so um so she's like
don't worry
i won't tell them you know
so if you don't wanna tell them i won't say anything either
so she ella tenía una cara pobrecita
so i i was like you
i did what mary said
cogí una cascarilla
and i put it behind my neck
pero con todo y eso i can still when you ask i could still feel it a little bit
and i'm like
you know what i'm gonna have to take
and i was good
i went
and i got era hoy chickpeas um sopa de garbanzos
tú sabes er
sopa de garbanzos
so i had that
and i ordered café con leche with no sugar
but it was hot as heck so i had to wait
entonces i kept putting off taking aspirins
because i was like
you know i'm gonna i'm gonna see
right i'm gonna i'm gonna wait you know
afterwards i'm like
you know what
i might as well take it because i don't wanna like yesterday
that was today
and then i said
did you know
cuando ya se paró ir al baño laugh
cogí el spray
y empecé a echar
i'm like
you know
quédate para allá
you know not over here so
i don't know
i mean ella la pobre she's not a bad person
yeah
i know
yeah she told that guy that one time when we were out
oh i didn't
maybe it was caroline
qué hizo ahora
right
so it wasn't just you laugh
she called her too laugh
oh my god
i heard i heard when you said that
but the thing is did you feel anything negative while you were there
no
so then why would you
because if you feel something all of a sudden
exactly
like that time that you had that coughing fit
you know
you know i don't think so
i need to ask david because he's the one that got the mail today
well i what i had done is i had emailed myself the thing saying that june six though the eight like that we have which is what i had emailed kelly
but remember i had emailed her the one that
from san francisco
and i said
it's the same except you know put
entonces what i had done is gone ahead and printed it out
and i go to trevor
this is what you'll be getting er a confirmation this way
but apparently he left it there like he went
when i got to my desk today on my chair
he had put the papers
and what he did friday
you know the meeting he went to friday
which of course he slept probably through it
and the other thing that he does is set certain colours
you know how kids do
so everything was coloured
so when i find him i go
i saw that you had fun
i go
and i also noticed you only had blue pen with you because you didn't do it in colours like you normally do laugh
so he was cracking up
i go
what do you want me to do with it
he goes
it's the same shit as always
go ahead
and just file it you know
i said
ok
entonces um so um he i had noticed when i got there in the morning that he had that he had left it there
so i went ahead
no
he didn't say so i guess not
entonces but when he left today since i went over there afterwards because then he told me albert had been there to drop off stuff
i looked
and he had taken it
so i guess you know
oh and i asked him
i said
i said
are you going with are you are you laugh gonna go by yourself on friday
or do you want us to pick you up laugh
and he goes
no it's ok
i'll go by myself
i said
yeah you don't want a car full of women huh
and he goes laugh
no
i go
you have enough with ladies
he goes
yes laugh
i said laugh
ok laugh
hi
kelly said she'll go by on her own because she doesn't know she's gonna be there exactly at seven eight or eight
but maybe she'll do like julia and go after she after making sure that everything is ok at school
ok
no i'll remind her
no no i'll remind her
but she was like
no i don't think so
because i said
are we picking you up
and she was
no no no i'll go on my own
i know how to get there
i'll go on my own
and then then you know
because i guess i guess she's like lidia
just make sure that everything's ok at school and then go
yeah they if they start the way they're supposed to it's at seven thirty
but now you don't have to turn in the er you know you don't have to
yeah they turn in the keys
but you don't have to do grade the bubble sheets anymore
like it's all electronic
right so that's why nowadays if you've get a check off sheet it's like
ah we don't have to turn in grade bubble sheets which was the important stuff
yeah now the problem will be that if some of these people aren't like for her right now she should already be inputting the grades and uploading them
because if they start waiting you know what
computers are gonna be stuck and slow and all that stuff which is what happens in the other quarters
yeah
so i had um another albert called me
and he and i got some of his papers
and he goes
no i'm putting the other one
he goes
what date are we supposed to print out our class list for you
and i said
well it's always supposed to be the last day of the quarter
but that would be the fifth
and then he goes
yeah but
i go
yeah but i'm sure you have mostly seniors so you know what
and i doubt it that you're gonna be having any kids with drop today
so you might as well print it out today
he goes
ok ok
i think so
well i'll ask him i'll ask him
because
yeah para no tener que ir en dos carros
unless like the kids are home
we're doing a study whisper
yeah
right
oh and is she gonna go now
sí porque si ella estaba oyendo oyendo cuando mary vino
y dijo
te dijo que amy was gonna be a volunteer
or something like that
she goes
what
and then mia said she had been
oh the millionaire that's right
you guys have that coming up
and caroline started looking around like
de qué hablan de qué hablan
and then mia goes
oh have you been
and she goes
yeah i went last year
are you going this time
she goes
oh i didn't know anything
i didn't get anything
caroline
quién
don't remember porque ella es despistada so
entonces entonces um mia said
i went last year
but now i have other things
i'm not going this year
and then that's when i guess mary said is going
and then she goes
oh is maria going
i could always go with one of her tickets
that's what she said
and i was like
thinking to myself
i thought that won't work
one of them was mine
but ok
ok
trevor and julia
yeah
i don't know
right
exactly
yeah because the ticket i think is just a
es un un foreshow
yeah
exactly
sí ella es un poco
i was noticing that
during the thing when mia was going around asking what did you feel what did you see
i know but
but she was looking around a ver lo que decían las otras
creo que que
right
i know exactly so
if you are feeling all good why all of a sudden do you wanna
well that's the one that maybe she said she had no hope
she had lost all the hope
yeah
right
yeah
i was gonna say yesterday for this young man
but i really didn't know his name
martha'seng
stepson
but i don't really know his name
i know she calls him dani
so i think his name is daniel
but i wasn't
totally sure
you know
and i was like
do i
or don't i
you know
but we can do it
you have the powers
the healing
this is something that he doing for linguistics
that means how do we speak
but it's for and i because and i are the ones that switch languages
you don't
so
pero no um
no yesterday was fine
i was doing
i started coughing which i i i was
but i was
i was trying
pero no coughing
doesn't maria jose say que happened
it's because you are trying to stop it or block it
in one of the books we've read
doesn't it say that
like when someone's saying something
and you start coughing
or that's what pam
you know
one of those things that she says that you
like when people when they're saying something
and and
and you're like
right you don't wanna face up
or you're lying or whatever
you
so i was like
and she's talking
and i start coughing
and i'm like
why am i coughing
there's nothing
you know
you know so i'm like
and patty was funny
she was watching the birds
they were they were flying in and out and
ella es linda
tiene algo linda
sí
yeah i heard you say that
i heard you told mum
see
it was funny when mary said
patty is coming
i mean i know that patty was the other one
but then she said chetan
chetan is normally
for us it's usually a guy's name
at least all the chetans i've even known have been guys
yeah
so when she said chetan
and i told mom
i was thinking of the one that we went to her house
so i thought it was the the lady who had been to her house
go to mom's
sí sí es una es la es una pareja
and then when they show up in their both
that's right
but like we don't really
right but i don't really remember her name
so i go to mom
es una pareja
and then they show up
and they're two women
and i'm like thinking
i hope mom doesn't think they're una pareja you know
no exactly
so is samy
and samy was saying something about her husband
yeah because she comes into
when johnny was as rude as he was
she was throwing away
when she was started throwing away some of the stuff she goes
do you recycle
and them um said yes
my husband says
you should be happy i recycle as much as i do
oh i'll be happy when you recycle everything
so that's the way i figured she's married
to a man not laughing
so
yeah
no y tiene algo con los animales también
pues viste
enseguida she wanted to cut to clip the wings off joseph
you didn't see it did you
oh my god
well i i watched her because we had our eyes closed
pero
you know when we opened her eyes
and then she would say
oh do this now
or she would all of a sudden start
me she would get these lines right here
and she her mouth would like twist
and then that's when she would start
and i was like
ahora está de vieja
o viejo
you know one of the two
and it's like mad
and then you could
like she was struggling to get the words out in english
or something like that
you know
so it was like wow
yeah
and even her hands kind of twisted a little
i was like wow
yeah
sí pero caroline wants to
which is funny because to be like you like you say she's as enlightened as she is
right but you think she'd be more open
pero en seguida she wants to
maybe she's more like marta
because she wants to then figure out why is it that they're like that
why do they have this
because enseguida
what language were you chatting in
you know and what
just let her chat
yeah i know but
yeah i know but still
yeah oh really
no
oh no that's weird
yeah that's weird
doing good
that's good laughing
yeah that's not
yeah
maybe she thinks she's the pope
well the pope for for that
that sect religious sect or whatever
because when you don't
even if you think it's not a religion it it that's like a a cult
yeah that's a cult
like the hare krishnas
you know like the hare krishnas
of her
oh yeah no that's not good
oh no that's not good
is she dead
i mean
like raw and stuff
yeah
yeah no that's not
exactly why are you lighting a candle
right but not in front of the picture
well that's not a good thing to put
that's that is it's like you are idolizing
because we do or will say some people do put light light candles for for someone who has just passed away to give them light
right
yeah the day after
no the day of after halloween after halloween
person
my sister in law quiere que haga you know
she she is a linguist
and so she wants to sort of track you know spanglish
so she asked me if i would wear it at work
so if you see me with this thing i look kinda goofy
yeah it records it and all como los chips de la camarita
and then if you know
she's got like a grant or something
and then i guess they figure out you know whatever she does something to do with transcribing and spanglish and you know lo que hablas and everything
pero no
lo lo apago
so
y tu amiga
y tú no puedes salir en esa vaina
hello * si es four wheel drive
nieve
mi hermana vive en georgia
bueno yo no sé dónde está la casa de ella
ya más muerta que viva
anoche
eso queda como por la mitad del estado
no no no
eso está en el medio del estado
está o al norte o al sur de gainesville
eso es horse country
it's really pretty actually when you
i think it's before gainesville
i think it's seventy five
i mean you can see the big las las pieces of property con que parece que estuvieras en you know en virginia where they have the horses
it's horse country
cause porque ahí esa parte del estado has a little bit of hills not like a lot of hills
no no no
so you see the big properties with you know you know the trees
and you know you see the horses
it's very pretty actually i mean
y salieron los dos
es que están perfect
qué monada
right it is so cute
qué
pero también que a mí se me parece a la madre
si tú ves la foto de la madre de la
ay laughs qué mala
very cute
está de lo más mono el chiquito
coño tengo hasta frío
pero yo no yo no oigo el calor tú sabes
tú sabes que cuando tú pones la calefacción
el lado allá hace sesenta y uno
es el north side
so it doesn't get any sun
bueno
cuál el que vive aquí al lado no
qué fresco
you can call it this laughs
ah los manda solos y él no viene
oye qué frescura
bueno too bad
no
right right right right right right right
y y y te han hecho para que nadie entienda lo que dicen
pues sí el vi
yo me paro
y digo
voy
esa no yo lo siento mucho
yo sé que ya para las las cuarto de la tarde no hace frío
voy
y me dice jennifer
tú crees que tiene
y yo heat
que no hay calefacción
entonces entró donde helen
y me mira esmeralda porque yo le dije que yo la he prendido
ha sido un comentario
yo voy a decir
sí yo hacía mucho frío
y dice
y le digo
y acá decía seventy four
a eso lo tocó él porque jennifer y yo pusimos setenta
y eso que allá atrás por lo menos les cae el sol
cuándo regresa
y a él se le ha warm up the la la sangre se le ha puesto un
no
that's what they said about five years
mi carro tiene un thermostat que te dice you know
y te dice what it is
yo me cago en la madre
fue vaya cuando ya regresé del grocery
pero cuando i dropped the groceries and i left decía treinta y nueve
maybe
no cause it has a sensor
and the sensor is on on the dashboard
so i guess it takes it
in the the one i think i'm i i mean this car provides heat
pero no es como los carros normales que si tú quieres calor tú lo mueves a rojito
the only way i can turn the heat is i have to tell it auto
and turn the temperature up
because then the sensor will know that is cold outside and it throws hot air like you don't you can have
and it takes time
versus the old fashion you turn the knob to the red
when the car is warm it throws hot air
it takes time because engine the engine is your engine's too cold
pero the first time i went to use this heat a few years ago i'm like
where is the heat
you know
right
electrical
pero el aire acondicionado sí te da el chance
you can hit on
and you turn the you know you
i don't like i don't like that that they do the
it's kinda weird
i don't like it
i mean i like the old fashion knobs
brrru *
you know laughs
right
i mean it warms up
but it's weird
lo pongo al rojo
déjame decirte
nunca lo he usado
ella lo prendió
y dije
me dice laughs
no es que tienen el el heating thing
oh
click i turned it on
qué rico
i didn't need it
it is supposedly
so i was like
the first time i ever use it
no i didn't even turn the heat on because i figured i was going to wait
ah
tú va te eh víctor está viviendo con ustedes otra vez
ay la verdad es que jorge es muy buen marido
me acuerdo que tú me dijiste
él es enfermero no
oh that's not fair
right
that's not fair
that's not fair
y por qué no les dices al
they are not gonna give a good reference
can he just tell them
they're not
coño pues that's not fair
and say that they
you know
de todo un poco
right
you can't do that
entonces la tienen cogida contigo

if he doesn't
right

ok ok ok
but i did send you an email couple of days ago that friday january the eighteenth is a teacher planning day so it'd be a good day to do all the schools if you wanna get them over way

i just didn't find them in the server so i wanted to make sure with the

i would u last simply because that's the last when we finished
you know i'm saying
because a ya llevan ahí ocupados
like three or four months
b lo mismo
they are occupied two thirds of the facilities for a month so i would do u as the last one
you know
si two two guys are wanna do offering one day fine
you know
we can do u one a different day because they still have work to do
so you know
there's no to me there's
it's not that there's no hurry
they just haven't had time to do the stuff
y para qué vas a ir para que después digan
chico no hiciste esto esto y esto y esto
you know
right but i but i least for a and b you know ninety percent of the staff
a should all be done
and at b most of it should be done because they've been doing a lot
so
thank you much

porque no está nada
that's what i
he said he sended again yesterday

that's right
they
on the eighteen it's a teacher plannig day so we should

next friday
there'll be no children
we should plan to go to a and b at least to review all our punch list to make sure
porque the teacher should be there
the teachers are there
there's no kids so we podemos entrar y salir de todos los cuartos sin ningún problema
uh monday is a legal holiday
i'd rather not use it unless we want to because they have to get paid overtime
but that thing that would only be at u one
at a i think we should do a first para ya acabar con a
check if it's done it's not done whatever it is
then we go to b and then
to me u should be the last one simply because they just finished
right and that's what i and that's what i told tom and said i would
let's do a first
if we can do b that would be great so we can finish those two uh
and then it's just a matter of waiting when they are ready for you because the are not going to be ready for us to review u one because they haven't done anything
you are trying to get the damm building get a water with it on
no preguntes
i asked peter
i did neither

that's
right
that's what martha told me
and the bacterials have a limited time
they only have thirty days
no it's thirty days
thirty days
the bacterial test is only the result is only good for thirty days
so if you haven't gone but they have h r s approval which is the part that there's a little confusing
or maybe until they run
somebody is a blind eye
no the h r s is health eh department
h r s is health department
that's the big one
oh so h r s hasn't because a water with steel it's not legal
oh so there are satelliting in it

he was confused too
apparently
it's a package that goes a document control
take our drawings make a new one as cold fish and get rid of everything but the fish number
we've we did for we did it for simply because they didn't give us the numbers but it was turned out convenient because then we already have the drawing

in vitro is your own your own genes
they're fertilized outside and then injected in you

no what runs in her family are identical twins not fraternal
that normally is
that i know
and i could be wrong
one egg claps splits into two
pero in vitro no significa que no es son los genes de ellos
outside
which is why people get multiple births
in fact i was watching las noticias
y había una mujer que salió con identical triplets
pero ellos no querían multiple kids

you are not a clingy
as maria and hannah
i
tom john says uh i candy

thirty two
you are such a youngster
i agree
either right after they left cuba
anyway my father used to tease her
because she said
se quitaba años no
cristina por favor
you'll be younger than my child
because she
she would also remove
so that you know
you couldn't figure that out
wait a minute
wait a minute
your oldest daughter is actually older than my son
he used to
and it got to the point that the joke was she wouldn't even know how old she is
and she she
ya ni se acuerda
y mi papá dice
sabes ella ni se acuerda
se lleva quitando los años desde que la conozco when she was only thirty two tears old
she was like
so why are you telling people you are older than you are
good morning miss

i can i can handle that
what's your name
she likes those things
very nice
thank you
who
something that you need me to find to for you o no
mhm right right right
well well you laugh
but when you if when you go to the grand canyon
i remember one of the first things i thought
i mean it's a national monument
it's a park
we are a land obsessed with
lawsuits
you know
the trails are in some places
here is the clift
particles that you have further heading down
on the top is not
there's a bunch of different trails on the grand canyon
some of them are only five feet wide
and i
honey
it'd be like
i you
and then of course laugh
you know
how how would you do that
require a of freaking
god
but i thought
how do they manage that one
and then they have an area that is like a look out
that you know uh
i mean it
it's been a real
it's been there fifty years because it's just one little bar
and i'm thinking
this the code
if we aren't we
thank you dear
actually
you can actually
once you are done with this one
let's see what they gave me for you
because the boxes are ready
but i haven't really looked at the drawings and what they sent me or anything
i haven't process those so
james looked at the same thing i guess
don't
doesn't hannah need some drafting help for
o k
yeah for twenty five dollas off so
i don't know
well it's twenty five dollars off
fifty
minimum purchase require
applies to merchandise only when there's not
and they think i'm a new queensborough customer
which is fine
so somebody else wants to order
i'm not really a new queensborough customer
but that's o k
beating them up
beating them up
i know
i always
those when i go to the zoo i always feel bad for the animals
although the zoos are much better than they were when you and i were kids
they were in a in a una caja una jaula
a chlorified cage
and that was it
that's how the zoos used to be
now that this open wide zoos are
you know
but i always feel bad for the big mammals
for the big gorilla
you know
the the mount gorilla
for the elephants
because you know they a lot of space
and when and the and the elephants
you see them
you know
i remember
this was fifteen eighteen years ago
give or take
and i hated it
because it was still the old type zoo that still had a lot of the cages
they were converting
they were converting
and i'm thinking
man this is my tax dollars
and i still remember going to see the pandas
and feeling so bad for them
the there was one inside and one in the top
and he is doing this
this is a
this is what we do when we're bored
he's got to be bored
you know
so you know
like the hippo
it just hangs out in the water and it's happy
but it looked bored
and i thought
i said i'm never going back to that zoo
i just can't
the the old zoo yeah
there's pictures on the house
the metro used to be at crandon park
yeah
when we were kids
i mean i remember going
i mean vaguely
i must have been four
nowhere
how do people fall for this stuff
that they have eighteen million dollar of money in a box
i well i get form different ones
i mean
ay sigh
you don't need no
you know
you don't know this person
you know
i i
you know
it never sees ceases to amaze me
how many people wanna be fooled
dígame
service county
there's no colour
it's all
there's no colour selection
yes
it's all staying still
we don't have any laminates in here
and why didn't they complain about this
no your response to him
your response
no isn't
they alwasy do that
they always do that
you response to him
and say
smith i am so sorry
we didn't solid the colour
however why didn't the contractor say something when he got the drawing back
you know
don't give in and say
i i don't wanna hear this excuse
be very polite
i don't wanna
hannah
hannah
they are not gonna finish on july eighteen
so they they're grasping strass
that's a pannel that's glued
to dave
to dave
because he has called talking to me
when he wants a pay application
i'm the one who signs them
this is that infamous uh that you the letter
oh i think that for some reason i think that you were jeff
i'm sorry
i don't know why i think
this is a thing that sonia was telling me about
right
right right right
something came out
and we do not seen it
oh this was just issued yesterday
but they are not open to the public like are
but the space doesn't doesn't comfortably feel that way
right but we can send sonia or
or hannah
right right right
you know
they do lab work
right
we we don't write
if if this is hospital related
right
when we were running with this
and we got the prototypes jeff
so we gotta to be a little positive here
i know i know i know
this is what you got
i guess the letter was addressed to me
how did you fing that again
yeah
joan just joan just
i don't know
i guess
did i write the the letter
one of those i remember doing
uh but i guess joan sent it to me
ahí está
todo tuya
para que lo tengas electrónico
because joan forwarded it to me
oh
like a shortlisted
oh he saw that
so they just issued it
bueno pero es not only that
and you know
and you know what
i think he i think jeff may be right
mandaron algo
and for some reason we didn't get it
who knows what
mira hasta ahora
porque it says due date january
sí sí sí pero they they just
right right right
but i'm saying this
pro ninth
and they faxed it

i don't either but i
como
y y llevan haciendo esto por años
sí exacto
si fuéramos los únicos
la calé sí
pero no somos los únicos
ah no de verdad
sí sí
pero ves why
they're mostly engineers
right right right
no
para mí es something
how did we how did we find out these projects
right right you would have seen
right right right right
we wanna know because
because otherwise
i mean
or you can just for the hell of it complain
it would be nice to find out when the presentations are
so that
you or i or hannah or something can go just to to see how other people do things
le digo
y me dice
es un public fail form
pero la la
so is very easy to hang out
pero en county no es tan comfy como eso
tiene una mesa como cuatro o cinco gatos sentados ahí
o sea there's no audience space
no es como el de que lo hacen in a big trailer
pero me dice eh
y no apagó las luces
no fui yo
estás
pareciera lo más probable
yo dije
i have been una de las primeras que he venido
y he encontrado las luces
mira eh eh
tú utilizas esos papeles para tus niñas pintar
uh
but that means that they have to stick what's drawn in the colouring book
a blank piece of paper gives them freedom
and paula loves to
you know
uh by the little
you know
they love to paint
pero si they are covered from
you know
termpera yes

he's got a very good memory
i don't either remember
i don't either
i thought it was all and steel
but i could be wrong
it was supposed we can pull out the job drawings
we may have
the only the other thing is that they also didn't say
verify brand and colour
of the serving line
stainless steel
no lo que es lo que le dije a hannah
they're going to slide into august eighteen
so don't take it personal
no we saw the texture
and i told them to book two

complaining of whatever is your problem is
they get upset
they stop with their their their little
no they changed the guy
no cameron cameron is not the guy anymore
you know
say you have we you are not gonna pay despite the fact that plenty of our conversations you you know you are supposed to have it
have they submitted that form
but they filled it up
have they received it back
has that that guy been out there to say it's ok
because
ah bueno
has not done a very good job out there
because because we did we did a
right
we we did a paint makeup at a u b
and figured we didn't like that yellow and that blue
which i never liked to begin with but
nobody believed me
and i thought i was being maria
how long have they have been shot drawings
then you put that in there
you know
be nice and polite
they're grasping straws
which means that the cleaning people leave them all alone
i'm young

and then
you know
this is taco
this architectural block

oh for gift
wait daddy
you know

what kind of toys that she have
you know
the thing that she has
mhm
she's still little
yet the staff that's a little more hands on
that you know
she can
you now
put the staff in the box
take it out
that's a perfect gift
ah no sí
right
eh y
tú viste
del viernes de whatever
por lo menos el almuerzo
el desayuno i don't care
they're
hay otros que he estado
that i've been to places
qué porquería
it's actually not bad
o k
qué tú estás haciendo
cork
just the basic tone whatever it is
right
right
yeah
porque tiene todo el equipo
pero you see this one
and this one
a wall here
where is the wall
no no no just graphically i see wall here
there should be a wall
a teacher a wall there
i guess some wrong some happened
right
because this is like a screen
yeah i think this is open
this is like a
so you have to put
oh o k
o k then graphically is not
how i see
and in the back i would maybe put something open the top just all the way across
or something
because there's equipement back there
she may not see it
just not gonna see it
he may well look ant the the equipment
because there is the refrigerators and stuff
i mean you can
what i would do is do this
is this just the grey
this is supposed to be
there are
that's what i'm saying
they didn't keep that
but i
by the way have a reveal
to do what
and how they're making the reveal
will it be all the way around
so graphically it's not indicated
we don't know who drew this but
either everywhere or nowhere
i have to look at it
where is it
ten
i mean i
let me see whay the plan says
let's see
on that wall you have
well actually you don't have as much
ven
it's this wall
so you have this equipment here
things you've open
and then this stuff
and i tell what that stuff is
o k
o k three forty seven is
a puller so that's gonna be high
three forty five is
hiding cabinet
four o two is probably a sink
yeah is a work table with something else
this is a table so this is low
and this is este es pariente lo mismo
three forty eight
yeah past through they're tall
there's a hand sink
y después
this are to this
must be is probably the same arrangement
so aquí no va a haber nada
you see here here here here
you could see behind the table
so you can do something
right that you can see
and then this edge you can see
and this edge you can see the one
right
and stop maybe to the frame
and then you can take it from from here to here
or maybe it's just this little piece or something
right right
what detail is that number again
ten
that's there's no such ten
how does that work
how does that detail work
there's no such
eight nine
but how does that detail work
i'm just curious
it goes all the way around
it sees there are everywhere or nowhere
how the hell are they gonna do that
not only that
oh you they are not gonna do that
but your edge of your stud is here
to give it
to give
yes which means you are gonna add a piece to get that
no because because
here is your your stud
are you going to are you gonna push
beyond the stood
but how are you gonna push beyond the stud
that's not what's drawn
that's two tiles
why couldn't you just use a color if you wanted to create
i mean that's your bullnose
i
what we need to do is find
that that detail does it doesn't give the enough
eh it's gonna look
you have to many things
make that out of a different size tile
you want it at top
could you make it out of
do you see what i'm saying
just a different colour tile
yes sir
and then i got sidetracked
o k
i eh actually
and i thought i printed it
initial tasks
but you don't tell me what the initial tasks are
o k
i printed it
somebody run off with it
right
o k
i printed it
and i don't
i don't know where the print went
i don't know where the print went
because the first thing that charles tell me is
initial
but i don't know what they are
i mean a tile
a one or two inch tile
well we can do that
but what i'm telling you is that detail
before you
well you need to find the accesory that allows you to do that
o k
so this this is a different detail than this detail
to different surfaces
this is dry wall
this is back a house
this is back a house
we what i what i'd asked you to
if you wanna do it that's fine
but we need to create a detail that is buildable
correct
right
and and what's this tile was this gibson reveal
no
if you're gonna do that then actually make it a real reveal not a tile reveal
but what if what if it
it's
and this is not a tile reveal
there's to reveal reveal
yeah
but if you don't tell them how to make that reveal
you ain't getting the reveal because we didn't get them any u b because we just drew a line
then you need to get the accesories
it's two inch
you can paint it
wispers
wispers
oh but then you are doing six
so these tiles are six inches
mhm
i i don't have an objection to the reveal
but we need to make sure that we tell them how to build it
because that those details that we love to draw are not buildable
appears so
i have a couple of questions
all right
just so you know according to the literal points that they sent us a little portion of the second floor is concrete
o k
ah when you start listing what's its condition
i don't know what it is
structure
xxxx i feel like one of my students
i go
oh you still condition
yeah it's part of
right it's part of that pair right
right it's right there right
i would
right
o k
ahm
you have five thousand here
then you have ten thousand back here
ah five thousand right
the seminar we're to
there's a
there's a testing company that is using for the part session call
so i wrote it down
it's good to know
the budget we're making
it's in
do you see what i'm asking
what it would take to rehabilitate it
right
but but the i guess that the definition is what what the estimate is for
to make it a building that can be converted into something
you see what i'm saying
right now it's not usable
can we call it rehabilitation
because that's what you
but what
that says
i mean you you you're trying to make it
you are not talking about air conditioning or any of those kind of things
right right right
right because that's a right
then then it's a rehabilitation
deliberately open box
right right right
but the bulk of the budget is to make that building livable
so use
right
you know
the cost is not included eh
you know
the contractor will be responsible
we believe in removing current
you see what i'm saying
right
they are not only removing finishes
joke
oh ice
right
removal of all
ah shoring
shoring to allow us to
when they remove the roof they are gonna have to protect it from from from the building from becoming worse
you know what i'm saying
i mean that
um what's the word i'm looking for
we call it demolition by neglect but it's um
i mean you're protecting the building
i mean it's really to protect the building
we don't say anything about the outside
there's not a whole load of it
do we need to mention it
do we need to
in in ours will it say something about that outside
then my new
are they cleaning
leave it alone
well then that's what we put
there are no there is no side analysis or
you see i'm saying
how may cars are gonna park here
that's it
you know how this people are
i don't know
he said
so you know
you know
you see what i'm saying
a a very preliminary
concept of how do you could use this building
because if the estimate includes
you know
fifty thousand dollars for air conditioning
or how do you know your air conditioning
or you air conditioning
fifty spaces
right
you are right
but right now they are only asking us to
no
are you sure you raised it all
i guess he's come back to go and say
well that's part of your fee
but that's not part of this
particular moment
and then the prices i'm assuming
five
that's why you put five maximun
right
but you are not including this one
and see peter mark up first structure
but doesn't that mean that everybody gets some mark up
but do we normally do that
o k that that's what i'm asking
that's what i'm saying
you don't
right o k
how many hours do you think
right right right
mhm not necesarily
oh you should
right
right right right
fifty seven hours is plenty of time for the report
although you do describe them almost
separately
you can take it from the report
right
only you split them up between thirty seven and twenty
and see what they say
you know
going and developing those drawings
you know
it's like
that's true
stand up
i'm gonna think about it
i i' got a roof sketched this big
o k mister roofer
use this
back then that's all we needed for today
i don't think so
are we trying to leave a little early so we miss the crowd
i thought about it this morning
i said
i need money
i don't know
or a thousand
it's about a hundred
oye
se fue
el registration quel mel pusiste
eh tiene la licencia de arquitectura pero no la mía
or it's jus another piece of paper
ah o k
oh o k
ah o k
oh
coño
asustas asustas
ah dice que viene el martes
sí después no hay espacio sí
well maybe partially because a lot of of the boy scout leaders are
i mean and it it sounds
and i and i'm making this up i might be
but my theory would be it's men
and so they think
you know
you know
right
and then that the parents that are going the leaders are just as you know as forthcoming in their knowledge whereas maybe they're thinking that the women are not as
that that's my theory you know
they do require that you know one of our leaders must be you know certified you know those kind of things that those
we don't
but
a question for you
who's our commissioning agent for f k k a
right right right
are we are we doing an enhance or just prerequisite for florida keys
the engineer of record as long as they're not on the team
right
but i think if it's under fifty thousand square feet it can be done by one of the engineer's designers
it was by a company called spinnaker group that does
they're doing the
right right it's a prerequisite
and he said in theory it could the fundamental commissioning could be a different person than the enhance
but he said it could in theory it could be two different
well that's what what he said is that because they have something else it turns out that you end up only being able to have one tinkling noise
but because you have this other requirement then you end up with only having being able to get one commissioning agent
he said it makes no sense
you know that if you read them individually it could be two different teams
i can't remember what he said
woo hoo
mona did kurt talk to you about the
colored pencils
check by juan's desk
they check by juan's desk or the back area
yeah
ask juan who's usually the one who runs off with them
right
oh
y cómo que no
abre abre allá arriba a ver
abre el de arriba
just out of curiosity
i have to agree with that
for the girls yes
now this one this is an autocad drawing
i've just traced it because your stupid girl scout website doesn't give you the ability to download a decent tinkling noise
and i think i can
i i ungrouped it so i'll send it to you if you want to use it
i used jane's little thing
i might i made it la dee la dee da
i loosed it
i used a lot of your things
yep
he he he
that was that was good that was good
that was good
i can't know
we know we hadn't seen it of course we hadn't seen it because it was at your desk
glass stone metal reads
you had it under metal
marble adobe reads
what do you see when you see architecture reads
you see viewpoint reads
right
context reads
you know how the intersection of the building to the sky reads
i don't know why you have two of these
framing of interior spaces details reads
yeah
i mean i don't need to make those mumbles
reflection reads mumbles
types of architecture this is architecture reads
famous architecture famous architecture reads
and same thing here i mean i can get rid of that one
architecture is about history place time function technology materials and people reads
and then because your thing had something about the history of it
now you guys notice what
look at the difference just in in centuries
and then neoclassicism reads
one of the rooms in the white house
it's really nice mumbles
um uh in berlin i think
you probably know what it is
what
i can't pronounce it
it it's schinkel
i don't know if it's from berlin or not
mmmm i think it's a church
oh it may have been
now it's a
alright where was i
industrial revolution the art nouveau art deco reads
then what is an architect reads
and then i left jane's little
there's the plan
and then you know since
what it is reads
probably a little more than they have
but you know
and then famous architects
i'm gonna i'm gonna get rid of these other ones and do women
right
and i already got
tools of an architect
again these are jane's little pictures
and then i show them a little bit about autocad
it's not even autocad
you know autocad doesn't have decent images to steal
this was from like cad or some website or some other
ah there's the elevation
and then you know our school tinkling noise
you know so they can see a real building
i may get rid of some of this animation
and i can't get the animation to work but i have to ask her
how it there it goes that's it
that o k
and then i have a thing this full of books
i went for the ones that have pictures
um now i i'm trying to figure out what they can do what they can do
what is wrong with being an architect
no no no
i don't know why people say
i don't want to let my child be an architect
no no
yeah
the grass is always greener on the other side
you know if you're an attorney
i'd have an easier life if i didn't have to work eighty billable hours a week
one day you know if i was to do something different i wouldn't do this
if i was to do something different it would still be design related
yeah but that's hindsight is you know that's hindsight
oh god it's it's hard
i wouldn't be accepted in any school of architecture
oh intern right
i mean i have
i probably have ten or twelve books
just leave them in the car
take them with you
i tried to get picture books that had pictures in it just so
so they can see design
and i have a book on on something else
todavía tienes cookies
what
what happened what happened
what are you looking at
uhhuh
what is that
nobody sees it
oh
let's see where were you mumbles
yeah let me put some more on female
yeah you can keep some of these things over here
and you have classicism industrial revolution art deco modernism then reads
famous architects reads
and then i'm just gonna make one slide or two slides of women architecture tinkling noise
tools reads
this is where i was
it was right here
and and i i don't know how to get this animation to work
well i'll just put it on the website mumbles
if not i'll just dump it
i'll put it on my laptop
right or something like that
when i'm done with it yeah
have it work
want me to save this into the system
prior to me changing it
save as
uh image as graphics reads
do you want me to call it
v one career day career day types
she's out of the office
i'll answer him
i'll be my polite usual self and say
because you didn't ask for it you didn't
right
this is probably
this is a cad color presentation
that's right
that stupid cramer shit
eh yeah it's not um no
i mean well actually it should be
because because the owner only gave us one freaking copy
and well fifteen months is an exaggeration
but you get the point
uh so it was the copies for the owner copies for the contractor copies for us copy for mechanical so it
the the the c c t v the security cameras coordination
right
contractor
right this was the one from prices so they needed copies
so it should be reimbursable
we should charge em for that one
oh that's nice
yes my favorite he's awesome
he could draw
josef hoffmann couldn't draw
but he could draw
we went to when i was in europe to um the paris
you know early modernism art nouveau art deco secession you know secession
nineteen hundred paris called nineteen hundred
and it was in paris in the pompidou
this was twenty years
it was one of the first exhibits it was like a comprehensive exhibit of that earlier and the precursor to the modernism
you know otto wagner josef hoffmann
and you know he did a lot of work
he couldn't draw if his life depended on it
and my best fried goes
if he can draw
but hoffmann's he's the one who
you know he wasn't he was a little bit less busy than than than wagner
i mean and he did like restaurants
and he even did
i mean it was a comprehensive like it used to be but he couldn't draw worth a damn
draw by hand
he still follows the old fashioned
santiago calatrava
oh really
well calatrava's like that
you weren't here
well you were downstairs when i came back from the las vegas
five
so he was the speaker
and you know it's he he pulls out
and actually he's a really really humble person
you know how some of these people they're just like
he was like he was so honored to have gotten it that
you know he was like in awe that all these people thought his work was really good
that he
i think he has an office in new york or he's living and he said that you know the americans are
i mean i was like oh my god this is a real person
tsk and so he starts talking about the design ideas
and how he uh
and he starts to draw with watercolors
five thousand people the it's projecting you know half this room
oh my god
i mean
he wasn't in
i mean he was nervous speaking
you know which was kinda like endearing
oh my god
i mean he was in his element
and he's just drawing
and you're not nervous drawing in front of five thousand architects
you know it the good his work uh i have a book downstairs of his stuff that i bought
because he's an engineer as well
um
um
right
the thing is i i would argue i would i suggest i would venture to suggest that many of the troops do things they just don't tell the council they're doing
does that make sense
right in our case because we're through the the the the church then you know it's not you personal
you know we we we have the the church
and half the kids don't give it to me
and they're going to camping this next weekend at peace river which is a river up um
and and with the canoe you canoe
it's like twenty three miles down uh north of of fort myers or one of those places
and i told the kids
if i don't have a permission slip you are not going
i don't care how old you are
i don't care if you're a senior in high school
you are not going
they're like
o k maria o k o k
because they'd get lax
and mom and dad were going
i don't care if your parents are going or not taps
right but in this case we are going out of town taps
i mean you have to camp with you bring what you got taps
peace river
no
hello i i gave em
we're not around the corner taps
and i said
it's like coño
porque es una mala crianza
and they think they'll just keep doing it
oh but they don't give you one they don't give you one
see our application form the back of the application form says the name gets sent to the council has all the medical history on the back
and we keep it on file tinkling noise
o k henry had a little too many things to
when he was growing up
alright
but why we certainly understand the challenges of finishes this project within the scheduled types
time frame types
time frame types
but i find it difficult to believe that all the kitchen equipment that must be manufactured in several finished panels will delay production types
but in the types
in interest of fairness we are not the production company types
in the future please contact our office immediately types
by phone if necessary to get the required information types
therefore one of us one of us is likely to have the answer immediately types
i already said immediately
instant instant types
oh i forgot bob bob
i know and we have to respond we have to respond
of delay
yeah and we certainly done all mumbles reads
but in the interest of fairness we're not the production company reads
in the future please contact our office immediately reads
by phone together with our our school staff um um um reads
therefore one of us is likely to have the answer instantly reads
answer
thank you
i was being polite
jane's mine i'll just put carl in here just because carl can curtail his
he sure did
alright where's your other one now mumbles
i i don't even feel like writing
let's see tsk
when were we were out there
march twenty-fourth
back sighs
jane
i haven't even read it
i will read it
and
i were out
no we weren't out there on three twenty-five we were on three twenty-four
we were out on site to review texture mockup on three twenty-five twenty-four tsk types
we did mention the requirement of color approval types
because a paint chip is never the same as the real thing with sun and materials types
as part of the mixture types
do we need a a mockup for the inside
just so you understand our interest in the exterior color mockup at a u a u v types
the original colors we selected did not turn out like we thought types
and therefore had to select different colors types
we do not want to come out to types
to know when we can come and review colors mumbles types
are you sure we
i don't think we did exterior interior
do we need them
let's go ahead and look at it
because some of the interiors at a u v i would have lived without of happily
like that that um bonafide beige
you can't see it
you can't
he cancelled
o k
just so you understand our interest in exterior colors reads
we are positive that reads
eh i'm just trying to give it a positive spin here tinkling noise
that types
all of us working together will result in a successful project delivered on time types
how's that
um i am told that the paint sample for every everyday white did not match the intended color types
and we ask for resubmittal types
i'm leaving a little early but
uh one thirty tim washington's coming here
to review
i'm just signing a pay out
do we need to say anything else
it did not match the intended color correct
it is not a new color types
but do we know
ah it is not a color types
hence the painting sub needs to match the basis of design types
you wanna put something yes
oops
uhhuh
uhhuh
i thought we picked the colors a long long time ago
no it was more than that
longer than two weeks
i thought it was longer than that
because we
you would've had it mumbles
so what you're telling me this
updated
but we've selected those colors a long time ago
why had we never updated this
and we still didn't read our a s i
no no i'll tell you what happened
this is a legend being xrefed from a different file
she fixed the legend at w
but it was still xrefing at non w
i bet that's what happened
bet you a million dollars
because i have found plenty legends that refers to not it it's own w folder but back to the original
back to the original uh
do you see what i'm saying
because there's no way
there is no technology
then it's referring to the wrong folder
she changed this
you know she changed it two days before
when that new drawing was opened
i did guarantee you it's that that it was referring to
people need to look at these things before they're released
because if i know i've changed a legend
and when i haven't did when i've discovered that it's not then i change the legend
and i'll go
who the hell
and then i go in the xref
and it's referring the same folder name but under a different project
then we then we do need to bring it in
that's o k
we do need to let we just
we just need to we just need to make sure that staff realizes when you update a legend make sure it's referring to the folder it's supposed to
because when you stole that legend from another folder a lot of times we forget
particularly because we borrowed all these drawings
it was a different path
i'm not gonna win so
and i'm not gonna win
so what's his problem on this northeast person
what'd they do
oh they definitely definitely
because we pick on each other for work quite never that uh
we we stop beyond getting too cruel
a ver si un día se me va el catarro mierda este
coño
porque ella se va la semana que viene así que tengo que que ponerle más horitas
chica pero a quién se le ocurre hacer bubblegum de estos sabores diferentes
sí
so toma tomaste aspirina o algo de eso
a quién se lo confiscaste
todos estos candies son de tu hija
coño pues
oh tantos huevos consiguieron
coño
coño
sí eso es muy duro para las niñas
let me do it first laughs
that's what the weather said
tom and i saw it on the internet
i saw
or satellite dish
i still don't understand that the advantage of that over cable speaking with a candy in her mouth
is it
ah but they've they've divided them by groups
you're flicking the
they have them by groups
it's too much because you have seven hundred channels
oh shit no
i have no idea what i did that day
i've got to make it up
so why why do you have to wait for me
and it doesn't matter
adam can i get a look at that closely
well
and she didn't gain practically any weight
and she wore clothes who hide the fact that she was pregnant
because i was here
claudia the christmas party
but
so no believe half of what she tells you unless you get somebody else to give corroborate the story
right she
she didn't show
and she wore like not like big clothes chewing a sweet
and she still didn't tell anybody until she had to like at six or seven months so chewing a sweet
don't plame boor eddie for being lost chewing a sweet
well you didn't help the matter chewing a sweet
thank you chewing a sweet
thank you laura chewing a sweet
she really and truly did not look pregnant chewing a sweet
particularly because the woman sits in this corner not that way chewing a sweet
how did you not see me pregnant with brian chewing a sweet
ah
oh boy
huh
yeah
you mean er the post
they end up pouring a footing for
what do you mean by bunny ears
uhhuh

yeah because you come and do visit you but you come also and visit your mum all the time
hi mum bye mum
i was about to make that comment just based on your statement that she's very
fortunately not after brian
no i don't think it makes a difference
well it's probably during pregnancy because you're swelling
and so then you know you stop wearing the smaller shoes
and the next time you go shopping you're like you know you're like
ugh i don't fit in a nine
you try the nine
and you go
man my foot don't fit in there
so it's like
ok nine and a half
oh that's comfortable
and then next they'll tell you like

you try a nine and a half
i did buy a pair of nine and a halves the other day
don't know how i got in them
it was an open-toed so that's why
i thought you were in tambys because there's less crowds
somebody sent me a picture of some ride some roller coaster somewhere up north some humongous roller coaster that is one of those i don't know
and you could see a cut it was a bunch of shots
i mean
and you could just see
and you're going
not huh not if you paid me a million dollars laughs you know
and you could see
and i'm thinking
who the hell is riding that thing in the middle of the snow
it must have been a family
it was ridiculous
you know like a twenty-storey building i mean it was something completely like unreal
i'm like
no i don't think i'll be using that roller coaster
what you didn't want to get wet
i'm sorry i don't see
oh i see it right there
it picked it up a little bit

she acted like a tourist
ugh it's cloudy
and then pst
it's the worst when it's cloudy
you know that don't you
or are you still a tourist in your own city state
people always do that
they don't put sunscreen on on a cloudy day
i thought we weren't gonna stay very long
those were your words
we've had a peter lang for years
so lorrie was being a tourist
pero tú te pasaste las cuatro horas acostada en el agua así quemándote como una lagarta un lagarto

yeah
we can do a trade
right right
i don't think is that much of a
difficult
striker then ask for too much
this is how much it is
but you have to say this is
right
right right right right
well actually what it was claimed in my emails
uh that he is charging for
and you may have been already on w
he claimed that then we told them to move up a u
first we were never included
the width is for a panel
but i have a picture like defoes
because that's the only ones that you see
and defoe sent a picture and it clearly shows the insta hot under the sink
and i think they said that yes they had put him there and then they had to move him to the top
i gotta figure out whether it's a or u
well i mean just to check
at versailles
he was she was there with her nephew who just came from cuba
sí es funny

de lo más bien
vino qué
mi hermano mi hermano llegó el sábado antes de christmas
y se fue el día después de año nuevo
bueno gales
y se va la semana que viene
so he is still here
no
él sólo nada más
vino sólo nada más
se queda con mis papás
y después mi otro hermano que se mudó para north carolina
él y la señora vinieron el veintinueve
and they stay until the day after
yep um
te acuerdas
vinieron todos mis sobrinos
everybody was here
yes
yo le metí a mi papá
mi papá tiene countrywhile
le digo
papi fíate de countrywide porque son unos estúpidos
no te acuerdas que a él le le pagaron dos insurances
sí sí lo devolvieron
y está de lo más contento porque le mandaron de eh de too much on the
so he has got something like two hundred dollars back
and i'm like
me
probably
i've got anything yet so
ya lo apagó
sí porque ya no se siente tanto frío
we ha we don't ever get it in the right sun so
where you go
why
on hot water
please ask me for a tea to stick in there so at least you can drink it
it took me a couple of eh tries to drink the tea
coño
we're up to sixty five
ay pero párate aquí
you need do you need glasses
annete smith do you need reading glasses

she's
she says you
the heel is like ten inches
look at those things
no no
and they cannot imitate it
what we had in the other schools
no
eh it was a camera
it was a camera
yeah i think so too
that is excessive down below
and you will need so many over
oh i know we went through all this with with uh
and he may have just copied it in you know
right
one of the projects
right
it's just and opening
why would you
because it's cold over here
that's fine
i don't even think they
did they buy any r a u and v
i've never seen the box
that's right
that's right
i think that's what they did
i think that's what they did
but our
right
personally
yeah well
no he didn't
has anybody complained
we i think he just forgot about it
we told him that there's a way to this back here
they they could care less about this one
particularly when you have a fence
a way to close this
you know what i'm saying right
right
because visitors are parking here
and they could theoretically sneak in back here
cause there are u and v the
we may have to find we may have to find a different
for the f b o
it's better
right
is it
that's supposed to be the
this is where the tank for the the eh gas is
oh they haven't updated the drawings
o k
o k
oops
oh the be here
and then how would they access

buenos días mister garcia pérez
happy new year
oh
cómo la pasastes
you have refreshing break
fuiste a alguna parte o no
ah
aha
no
um
ah very nice
was it full
eso no está lleno
um
too packed
porque yo me imaginaría que la época esa de de después de christmas estaría que no cabe ni
bueno juana juana dice que ella el año pasado fue a disney antes de christmas y que estaba super bien porque no había nadie
like los dos tres días antes de christmas
y le digo
juana tú estás loca
me dice
no no había nadie
it was perfect
so you never know
right
so eh me llamó mister um bowers
eh he wants you to do something for him
you know el vecino de a one que se queja que la luz de dump slide in his backyard or something
that we put that light shield the house light shield
he wants you to look at the photometrics
and see whether it's
once you put the light shield
they are still complaining
and they are still going to be bitching and moaning
and aparentemente le mandó a la principal de a one un email de esos insultantes horribles whatever que le dijeron
you know you can't communicate with her anymore
you know one of those kind of neighbors
so what he says they are not going to get remove of the light or anything cause they need it for safety
but he wants to you know have time to pull evidence
mira los photometrics con el light shield esa luz no tiene whatever
you know it it it's acceptable
well that's why i've been calling to pedro para que me diga cuál es so that you know which is the pole that we put it on cause i don't know which one it is
it's not the neighbor in the corner
yo creo que es el de al lado
but i need to confirm so that we know which one you put it in
and then his other thing he noted when he was at the u one siding and connector road que pusimos luces
you know the new road we put in
me dice me dice esos están hasta más cerca todavía de los vecinos
right
so he wants to at least have some some comment from you from the photometrics saying you know the light level is is acceptable you know whatever standard that is
i don't know how you wanna coach it you know they want they are not going to remove it but they wanna be able to say bueno you know it's no different than whatever your house your street light or something so
which is the pole at a one and then at u one did we run photometrics for that new connector road way
ok so it'll be the same thing and we may have to put house shields you know home house shields on those para por lo menos quitar un poquitico porque he wants to at least show the
mira cuando no tenía un shield este era el luz que te tocaba
now that he has it it's a little bit lower
go away
all right
thank you much anybody need anything from

pero she used to live
well i used to work in sunset lakes right here

ok si vas para por esa misma calle hasta miramar
ahí está sunset lakes
la escuela donde yo estaba
que es un neighbourhood very upscale there
aw excellent
excellent
no es elementary
sí
middle school
well if you could bring the charter would be the best
pero
tienen lista de espera sabes
the waiting list is long
yeah
yeah
but the schools are better there
no
ah
i mean what i saw my sister in law teaches in new jersey in a a small town
se llama nutley
y como en new jersey las escuelas son están
they are managed by the the cities
not the counties como aquí
claro entonces las comunidades son más pequeñas
las escuelas son más pequeñas
because she doesn't know where what waits for her here
i wanna know about ronnie
ronnie i have i don't know anything about
she had a boyfriend she wanted to marry in april
coño voy pero no se puede
no pero no pero dije coño
er no ahem tiene un novio
se quería casar en abril
now in during spring break because she wants me to go
and which is would be nice
pero el ticket es mil dólares
el más barato
y ahora que el la gasolina está aumentando es más todavía
y los impuestos aumentaran
yeah colombia
es mucho más lejos
i know
i know
no it's a long trip
that's why it's expensive
pero mil dólares na el más barato que consigues
y con curtis y yo son dos mil dólares nada más que el tickets
más lo que una lleva más
i know
más
se hacen seis mil
entre pitos y flautas
yeah
y y lo que pasa es que bueno i want to go because my mum had a stroke
a few weeks ago um a few weeks ago yes like a month ago
and she she is fine now
está bien
pero vos sabés necesita ayuda
y no sé me parece que que tengo que ir a verla sabes
entonces lo que pensaba hacer es en vez de ir ahora en spring break por una semana mejor ir en junio during summer vacation
so
so i was thinking about going to see my mum
and maybe have
you know that ronnie is pushing me pushing me to have plastic surgery
and i think it's about time
so
i don't know
no no i don't want augmentation
i want elevation laugh
because no porque si no voy a parecer más gorda
coño
no pero si me pongo
y o ridícula sabes
a esas viejas ridículas con
no
pero lo menos posible para que
in place to get them in place
i know whisper
yeah
yeah
to be perfectly honest with you flavia i'm happy with myself
and i don't know whisper well it's a little
sí sí
sean me estaba diciendo que le estaba he he was making fun of curtis
sean
er por la nariz porque va a ser narigón
si salga
si sale a él o si sale a su familia o a mí va a salir narigón laugh
yeah
so er he was
i was
what but he's
hmm
no but i was telling him
i was never
i was moan i mean yo tengo una buena nariz
but i mean una buena manija
but but i always
it's big
but it's no
because you because you're a sweetheart
pero
no
no but it never bothered me
why am i gonna if it didn't didn't do it when i was in my twenties why am i gonna do it now
no
pero
claro y las orejas
i know
they never stop growing
las orejas nunca paran de crecer
i know
i thought about that because it's getting a little more carnoso aquí
because what if i get worse than now
porque cuando ves a esta gente que tienes plastic surgery they really look ridiculous
it's true yeah
no and if i and if you go
porque esto también
pero if you go like that they've got to do the lip again
so whatever you do
it's not
se sí se deforma la cara
y dónde
yeah
well i was looking there was i was watching a magazine once
y estaba uh robert redford
er
no sí
bueno y estaban puesto estaban poniendo cirugía fotos antes y después
it it was like a poll no
que se cual que que se ven mejor antes o después de la cirugía
y todos se veían mejor antes
you know
so you never know
yeah i agree i agree
sí porque
bueno el esposo qué importa
no but
no pero
no after so many years
pero er i don't know
i think that you have to be happy with yourself really after all
pero como le decía a mi marido si si no lo hice hice cuando tenía veinte años que voy lo voy a hacerlo ahora tampoco
no
i don't know
but it's it's not
i don't know
because if it's i think that if it's going to create like a psychological thing
you know you know if you are really so unhappy that well fine
pero si es más o menos si estás
bueno pero ronnie es una máquina ronnie no para
se hizo
ronnie se hizo se había hecho los senos cuando era joven bueno
pero se le habían encapsulado
y se tuvo que hacer otra vez
so she replaced them with a new
well she had to do it
that was yeah
beautiful
beautiful
que yo le decía
yo me daría por tocarlas laugh
porque me mostró
y eran oh gorgeous
yeah
como tres mil dólares
aquí
no lo aquí sí lo hizo aquí
para hacerlo aquí era barato
ajá
pero dice que una clínica en hialeah que she doesn't recommend it
al médico sí lo recomendó
pero la clínica un desastre que no se lo recomiendo a nadie
pero me da miedo también porque no no puedes ahorrar en eso que you know it's important
you can die right there
the friend the sister of this friend i went out with tonight se murió en colombia
le hicieron una liposucción
sí
después
le hicieron una liposucción
and er
un coágulo no a little bit of fat went to her bloodstream
and it went to her lungs
and the lungs collapsed
y fue a hacerse una cirugía
y volvió y no volvió

no
y yoga te hace
but exercise helps
i well yeah
yeah nunca
no no te pero pero tsk
sí pero te acuerdas te er do you remember the car accident i had
right yeah
no
miramar and i seventy five
justo enfrente del canal de televisión
if i don't exercise

porque er las máquinas me aburren
me aburro
and the treadmill i think i am like a fool there going nowhere
la bicicleta igual como una
so
no pero si voy a caminar voy a caminar
er you know then not in a treadmill

y estoy de mal humor
and i go there cross
and i come back happy you know

y cuando llegamos
mick nos invitó
pero los padres no
ok well sean and curtis are in the bedroom
voy a decirles que
no er that bedroom
no i was fine
la otra vez nos invitó al cumpleaños
de la mamá no er me parece que de la mamá
y fuimos con un con una botella de vino laugh
flavia you are
you know when when the people are surprised to see you because you don't belong in there
me quería morir
tú no sabes qué vergüenza flavia
because
guys guys guys we are recording something so please be quiet
so we fuimos ahí de paracaidistas

y yo le digo
entonces entonces claro después le pregunté digo
are you sure we were
because i don't think we were invited
and they are polite
what are they gonna say
no no please stay
er yeah yeah
qué van a decir
y pero no no nos habían invitado a nada
i mean i could tell that
no sabes qué vergüenza
remember sean when we went to er fiona'seng birthday last time
no she didn't
mick invited us not not fiona laugh
well started an hour ago
we we went from one thing to another
no sé de qué estábamos hablando
aw
oh the the garage yeah
sí no i was
yeah exactly
and i said to her
trishia es la muchacha que vendía
tsk oh ok yeah
good deal
well they had a better deal then that
because when when i when i signed up it was hundred and sixteen for the whole year
yeah
y lo tuvieron ese er por bastante tiempo
that's why
or just just tell her yeah
porque oh sí hey
yeah
and and everybody else signed up for that deal
lo único que después te cobran una cosa por aquí y otra cosa por allá
that that i don't like because it's not
i don't know because porque um
yeah because er the contract is let's say x amount of money
one sixty let's say
no er whatever
y después te ponen processing fee esto
sí hmm first month whatever er
pena es
y ahí después te pongo otros cien en en en small print that you aren't que tú no lo
so
no doscientos en de vez de ciento diez como serían ciento sesenta una cosa así
yeah but in anyway it's a good deal
it is half of
but they got all the people that were going to lady of america
los trajeron because como cerraron
and now happens that there are too many people
that they can't no dan abasto
so the machines are always occupied
yeah
and the classes are always full
which isn't cool in some
and i think the the the quality of the classes improve
pero
yeah
and now and the the instructors improve too
yeah
no ahora son buenos
yeah er today er la clase que fui hoy
a a las nueve y media
i i scheduled to stay for two classes because i normally can do that
y hmm chica qué oh
no podía terminar una
no podía self-interruption de del
it's it's aerobics y body-sculpting
sí
but it's like step
the the first half is step aerobics
and then it's a
marian
marian she was in platinum before
y and y ahora es el manager aquí
what i'm self-interruption i self-interruption its
they were going to self-interruption well
last time i i heard
they were they sold all that property
and they are going to build the hilton
an upscale hilton or or
the marriott yeah
one of those that's gonna happen
tsk everywhere because they are going to do a hotel and time-share property
time-share apartments
yeah it is good for us
y el spa va a ser parte del hotel
i mean el spa and gym is gonna be part of the hotel
not
it will be most likely
sean we are recording here
yeah because what they are doing
yeah what they're doing trying to do is a resort a complete resort with the golf course and the spa
tsk no so
no they didn't they are not renewing the contract
i i heard from someone else that the owner pat segal the seegal the owner he is not renewing them the contract for next year
so be careful to what you sign
because maybe
i don't know whisper
well i think that they run the building
porque te acuerdas
i don't know
i i was under the understanding that they rent that from pat seegal
porque
no no no puede ser que lo haya construido trishia
sabes because yeah they started managing it
but pat but i remember that pat seegal they were going to do that gym with someone else before
and the
yeah and the deal fell
y después lo hicieron con lisa
i don't remember
but i remember there was
i think that maybe the the building of the er of the building construir el edificio it was part of the deal i guess
y dan and trishia empezaron a
tú sabes que yo no creí que yo creía que trishia era la mamá de de dan laugh
y ahí un viejo ahí y hay un viejo de canoso that it was that guy was the owner
and i thought that trishia was
oh my god
ese viejo es el papá
because he looks like owner
are
are you sure
no no puede ser
un viejo alto flaco de bigote
yes sí sí los he visto
pero
but they he doesn't look that he's that much older to be her father
or she looks much older than she is
oh no she looks much older
qué raro porque ella no

wow bueno
bueno when i was working when i was working laugh at the other school i had an assistant que nos hicimos como familia
we became like really really close
and estaba este señor que hacía que era el presidente de p t a
and he is an older guy
y mi asistente le dice
ay cómo está su nietito
and he was the dad laugh
the dad
oh my god that's so embarrassing too
bueno pero es que ahora la gente tiene
i'm gonna how than
i've done that
i've done that
yo por eso ahora no digo nada
nada no
porque digo no
yo no digo nada más
i don't laugh
no
y
qué lindos aros
hermosos
they are beautiful
gorgeous whisper son son diamantes o
tsk ahhah
beautiful
parecen diamantes sí
yeah
gorgeous
aw you always have nice nice jewellery
aw yeah
but you always have nice jewellery
probably
but
pero pero carmencita tenía muchas cosas también
sí a ella
to
sí
si no le cabe
you need to now laugh
maybe you can extend it
ok
cómo
yeah cómo está tu suegra
hace mucho que no la veo
sí
oh my god
y fue al tuyo
no
oh my god whisper
y cómo
he looked well
you look fine until you die
yeah
pero
ay coño
he reacted
que esa
probably
experimental
pero pero el cáncer de páncreas es it's hard
tsk oh
porque el padre el
de de órgano
well i was
sí te mata inmediatamente sí
bueno y flabia flavia yo tengo miedo
te acuerdas que hace two summers ago was the brain
and we went to the doctor
it dissolved
it the the thing dissolved
yeah
ok and i visualised que eso se estaba disolseyendo mumble
and i did all the self-interruption well
but i was two years at with that thing on
y se disolvió i mean it's gone
great
so i have a tsk er er frequent urinary infections urinary tract infections
so i went to the doctor
they did a sonogram blah blah blah tumor en en el spleen
y yo no sabía lo que el bazo yo no lo sabía lo que era spleen laugh
y el otro día este yo estaba diciendo vesícula
pero no era la vesícula
es el bazo
claro
bueno pero no lo pueden sacar porque si sacan el bazo com self-interruption compromises the immune system
so it could be susceptible
unless is completely unless is completely necessary because it compromises the immune system
that's what i've been told
eso es lo que me dijo
el bazo
so they're we're monitoring monitoring mumble monitoring that
and we're doing what we have to do
so er um
no
bueno no no pero well thing is ok here i am again visualising that the thing goes away laugh
you know well yeah no well yeah
doing all those things ok
no praying all todo all all mumble lo que se puede hacer all
you know it was so
that was in the back burner
el otro día fui al ginecólogo
y me encontró un tumor en el útero laugh
so i did a biopsy the other day
en una situación de cero a ocho
er it's not too bad
sabes no es
but it's not that great either
so en una situación de de cero a ocho whereas zero is nothing and eight is the worst i am a three
so the doctor sent the samples to an oncologist to to see what
pero sabes que es una tras de otra tras de otra
um we'll actually he was trying to solve the problem with the
not independence yet
is to find out todos los problemas que que pasan porque we we can't we can't get the um these the ah excel sheet on one page you know
we have to be doing little different things to get one report so we can send it downtown so they can you know send it to us
we're not really
they only helped us
that had nothing to do with
no
ahí
para tener control
nosotros remember we want to give the test not waiting for them to to give the test
you know the scheduling
it's gonna be three times in a week
it's gonna be monday wednesday and friday or something like that or
or or morning time
if it's in the afternoon then they do the orientation
not really
nuhuh
no no
van a gastar dinero
más dinero porque ahora van a darle un p h q a todo el mundo
whether you apply or not
tú coges el examen antes de aplicar para que tú veas
antes before you apply you take an exam
and you get a p h q
no it doesn't
you apply so you have a statistic of how many people applied
está bien
pero why not how are you gonna find out the person who who applied and who didn't apply if they didn't pass the test they're out of the picture
pero that's
son es una persona que aplicó
ok
what are you gonna do about that
right
but the only problem i see is
you should not give them a p h q because si esa persona no pasa el test why give them a p h q
why give them a p h q
a ti no te entiendo
cómo es posible
that's what i said
eso es lo que yo le dije
exactly
oye
no esa idea fue tuya pero yo digo en principio estaba diciendo yo eso
i've been giving that
y eso la la la idea de que que
te acuerdas
and why they can't accept the bat test
están aceptando
um like community college and they only have the f bat test taken
they don't the c j bat test and they accepting that
but sin embargo if you have a c j bat taken a f bat taken i cannot accept your score
they became state certified through the um the university
but es es una cosa lógica si pasan ese examen the f bat test si lo pasan why not y y y and the state accepts that one
f d l e lo lo acepta
volví entonces
no la nosotros no lo podemos aceptar
entonces dijo él que he came up with the idea
esta pregunta se la hice yo a él y ahora viene con la idea de él
yo también definitely
ahí en la orientación tú puedes determinar si la un candidato es bueno o no
y esa persona cuando dice
uh oh
van a averiguar de las drogas que usé o
i'm not qualified
i'm gonna leave
y no van a hacer nada más
ya le van a dar el el p h q para que comiencen con el p h q
entonces coger el examen entonces por la tarde
i did tell him that
i don't agree with it
yo yo estaba i don't agree with that
because you're gonna spend more money on p h qs giving it out to the people
de por gusto
right
exacto
pero eso es lo eso es lo que dije yo a él en en en la oficina mía se lo dije
yo no estoy de acuerdo con eso
yo no creo que se le debe dar a nadie un p h q a menos que aplique
because yo tengo un papel te mando un papel a tu casa what are you gonna do with it
das a los niños para que lo puedan coger porque if you're not interested why should i give you one
three times and within the year
and different versions
nine dollars
por eso te digo yo
no hacen no tiene sentido
lo que pasa es que yo quiero estar
numbered that's what they want
tienen número nada más
y para tener el número pues
no
definitely it doesn't have no tiene no tiene sentido
you're not gonna win it
you're not gonna win it
because yo se lo he explicado veinte mil veces a él
y él no lo quiere entender lo que entra por aquí
lo que le entra por aquí a él es
y mira mira mira lo que
va a haber un
va a haber un
exacto
cuarenta
freeze it
para diciembre
wow
so you had the the the summer off
wow
oye hablando de te acuerdas que dije que que estaba hablando de carle hablando de and opening the date
lo que dicho
lo que siempre se lo he dicho a él
vamos a
él él él dice que no y que no y que no
entonces ahora it makes sense because i told him
of course
y él él decía
que no que no y que no que no quiero hacer eso
que no quiere hacer eso
yo soy el lieutenant
pero el día primero se lo dije
even david se lo recomendó
se lo recomendó a él de de cerrar la posición
they're gonna do it now
después que yo decirlo
todos los meses los van a en vez de tener tres mil personas i'm gonna have at least um
five hundred four hundred something like that
not that many
yeah it could be
it could be
by now i have two hundred
i had two hundred this morning before i scheduled them two weeks period
in a two week period
pero i'm glad que lo aceptó
porque yo estaba detrás del
it's not just saying that you have three thousand
like like right now i have three thousand nine hundred people applicants on a list than having five hundred only that you can scroll down and and and choose from that
so that's why that's why i thought it um it was better for us
well actually it was better for me because i'm the one who works with the program
un cambio
tú no tú no oíste lo que dijo
bueno
para ahora ahora cuando estuviste estuviste con yo lo dije a él it means a promotion
because i'm gonna be doing
i'm gonna i'm gonna be doing testing
right
oh no no
the forget it
it's not that's not the way it works
the counting doesn't work that way
no van a hacer nada
mira
acuerda una cosa
yo llevo aquí va para diez años
y en los diez años a él que le prometieron que iban a sacar a la gente the personal technician todo technician iban payroll a trabajar aprenderse el trabajo
lo hicieron
nunca lo hicieron
nunca lo hicieron el crosstraining
and they are not gonna put it
no hay dinero
me dieron cuatro cuatro sargentos ahí cuanto le cuesta eso a nosotros
el budget de nosotros para bajo
estos cuatro sargentos se iban con a hundred thousand dollars
over that
ellos solo
cuatro
cuatro
ahí
no
están haciendo recruiting solamente
they go into the university a la a la ciudad y eso
llevan
i don't see nothing
i don't see nothing
supuestamente ellos van a la universidad
and they put up a little table there
and then they taking people signing up people
well you know and they
nosotros we don't see no list
if they go on the
ah eso es lo que te digo yo que aquí hacen lo que le dan la gana y ven lo que ellos ven y nada más
porque ahora mismo es no no es razón para tener cinco cuatro de esos sargentos en el departamento de nosotros
sentándose no nada
looking beautiful
sí
sí casual
mira
es más y yo digo no están tan y tan preparados esta gente
ayer tuvimos este un grupo no sé si fueron a un training bureau los alemanes
pues ellos fueron para ayer a nosotros there were about twenty people there
tú me crees que ninguno es oficial ni maría ni ni la otra nueva ni la morena este tampoco
ninguno
sabían qué hacer para poder presentarse ese give an introduction
yo tuve que meterme para decirle a ellos más o menos lo que se hacía en este departamento cómo se procesan el aplicante cómo esperar que es lo que se esperan in the academy
germany
you gave them copies
we didn't give copies of
the
sí
pero fíjate
entonces la um la morena empezó a hablar ahí
uno de los de los alemanes le preguntó que si tenía que para poder hacer policía
he said
no you have to be certified
no entendía la pregunta
le le decía
meatlover yeah
meatlover over here
that's you right
acá
tú te vas a comer todo eso
my god
eso da unas cinco personas lana
sí
un taco
un tamal gigante
ah tú tenías el lunch that dinner the other day
no
worse
it's been worse
we had more applicants before than now
right
some of them don't even have email so they they don't have a computer so they have to go to the library or friends house
uhhuh
yeah yeah
el mayor sistema bueno
el primero que no funciona correctamente como deber funcionar
se demora mucho tiempo para un aplicante poder terminar una aplicación y sentirse de ello como i did something you know
i'm expecting you know a response right away
you know and and the way it's going now is
is running running too slow
but that's what the what i'm telling you
that's the problem with the lieutenant
he does not let you speak and put your your your senses into the into a meeting
esto esto lo hizo el el programmer este emm
yeah yeah and he spent like maybe months doing this
that's what
y qué pasa que entonces en vez de él aplicarle esto el lieutenant took it upon himself
and and
he knew what he was talking about
but the guy was had more to say about
because he's the one who who prepared
and he has also other another form that he he actually a presentation
con más más y más este información
that we never went through the whole thing
we just skipped pages and skipped pages you know
no le va a hablar
right
but see that's the problem lack of communication
si él me ellos me llegaron a mí a decirme o sea decirle a
the lieutenant dice
no mason is the one that works with this
let's take them downtown and show them what he needs and how he does this so they can understand what's our problem
but he takes advice todos los meetings
iba
o sea they're never gonna know
right
no pero
sí porque te acuerdas de the county the county um emplea y hay una posición para secretary right
for example
drink water drink water
jalapeño no
anyhow the um so they hired one position for
and there's they say ah maybe a hundred people apply for the position of secretary
so they screened the hundred
and whoever qualifies for it they will pick out and interview them
in our case no
if you have a position that continues a position like police officer everybody applies to it
and everybody has to rescreen
and everybody's scheduled to take a test
so that's the difference
psychological
assessment's gonna be taken away now
yeah
they're not gonna do it
because since they gonna do it in the academy why have them do it twice
right
mhmm

yeah
well if you if you look at it it's more like um maybe more like you think about it
how will you handle this
you know will you ignore this person

oh my god really
de verdad
so when you take your contacts out you can't see
really
i thought i was the only one on that boat
no because when i
i
well you know what i hate the most is um
and i should get glasses
i had glasses
i i loose i i loose things so
but um like when i when i'm watching t v and it's getting late i just wanna fall asleep watching t v
but i have yeah i have to take them out you know
so that that's what sucks you know
and i'm looking at
squinting you know
oh ok
so you can't see up close either
ok
really
i have twenty twenty from like close like if i didn't have them on i could see i can read fine you know
like i if you know i can read that
but you know if like if you were to say what does that say i would laughs
oh really
oh ok
oh right
yeah i was thinking about that
what
oh really
oh
i didn't know that
yeah it it keeps getting worse yeah
yeah
why can't you go to contacts because
i guess it's something with
because they cut you know they they like cut the the retina the like retina off
is there
yeah yeah
do you like t l c
that's good i like t l c too
and the discovery channel and all that
the history channel more
yeah
yeah like what
which show
c s a c s i
i
when i got here
no
when i got here that's what i started watching c s i miami
and i was like wow this is a good show but after
yeah i've seen vegas
i don't know everybody tends to like that one better
yeah
but after like six months i was like i can't take it
it's too far fetched
it's too you know
first of all a precinct doesn't look like that
the employees don't look like that
i know
it's t v
i know but i like law and order because it's a lot it's it's it's real you know
it seems real
actually actually i haven't seen that
cold case is good
house is really good
yeah
what er um
i like the on a and e it's called the justice files or whatever cold case files but real ones
you know that i love
i love that
in a real situation
yeah
oh i see
wow no um there's there's nothing wrong with that wow that's
yeah
right right right
i was also
i took psychology too
and i was really interested in that stuff too
no i didn't get into that
because i
yeah
how'd you really
wow
it's good so why don't you do that
you watch c s i
no
really
you are too much of a moral person
it impacts you
you take it personally
oh yeah well that's the point that's what makes it a good show you know if
if you kind of take it personal
oh yeah yeah
no of course
you'll need therapy after yeah
you'll need therapy after the case
right
yeah
yeah well um it's like an outlook it's your perspective you know what i'm saying i i take things personally
but
you gotta you know on the other you gotta say like well sometimes you know i think you have to understand both sides first before you take it personally
would you take it personally
it's just no i know
i don't think anybody that does that can go by that
i don't think anybody's able
we're all we're humans
you know what i'm saying
no i don't think anybody can just say no
i shut it off at night
you know it's not something that
exactly
yeah
exactly

and they they make fun of it
everything's funny
you know what i'm saying

there's nothing wrong with that
so what do you do on the weekends then yeah no and there is
qué música le gusta
yeah
ok
yeah yeah yeah
wow
yeah yeah yeah
oh
i got you
yeah
oh yeah definitely
oh i see
no no no
me estás ahora ahora mismo hablando de cuál versión de la ecuatoriana o la colombiana
ya
pero los terroristas estaban en ecuador
ok
ok
excuse me los qué
no antes de eso
algo tú dijiste una palabra que no la entendí
dijiste una palabra que no la entendí
ya
el tuyo
mm
ok
so se puede interpretar como que el laptop que supuestamente encontraron que dijeron que había evidencia que comprobaba que ecuador tenía vínculos con las farc era verídico
por eso fue entonces que el presidente se hizo el loco
ya
correcto
y ahorita cambiando tú tienes tu licencia con residence verdad
no tienes tu licencia
con el address de aquí
de seguro
ah mi tía
ya no tiene que
necesitaba que votaras por mi jefe
ah pero mi tía no es ciudadana
hmm yeah
i'm working for este antonio lópez
que está lanzándose para commissioner
de la ciudad de miramar
entonces me interesa que gane para que pueda seguir manteniendo su oficina
desafortunadamente republicano
mhmm
es más presidente tuyo que mío
no
por qué
sí
aquí o allá
ok
oh claro
why
y qué es
so si lo queremos interpretar cuál sería el income limit para hacer considered
y ya eres pelucona
pero
pero te todavía no es
wow
sobre todo ella que tiene muchos millones en propiedades en ecuador
en el edificio
ciento cincuenta mil el diez por ciento son quince
el veinte son treinta
oh no
como aquí un incorporated
that's the way you do it here
in order to pay less taxes that i didn't know what i'm gonna do is you can incorporate yourself tú puedes ser por decirte ana lópez incorporated
y pagas el cincuenta por ciento de los impuestos
en vez de pagar lo que uno paga normalmente
i know
so that's the best way to go about it
you incorporate yourself as a person as your whole name
no no no that's in the case that you have a business
that's in case like if you have a business
and you're taking tax write off
like not w two
i don't know about her
con los extranjeros si no no no te podría decir
she has to pay
cuál
negative
so good she doesn't have to pay
she has lost a lot of equity
i was looking into the community where she bought
what does she have a three two or two two
i don't i think she paid like three hundred thousand
and i think know if she's lucky
between two forty and two sixty
i know it's bad
sad
she has to wait at least two more years
mírala
oh did you see the listing i sent you
i see
siempre por lo general el impuesto es del dos por ciento
por decirte si te compras ciento ciento cuarenta son dos mil ochocientos menos el home exemption unos dos mil cuatrocientos dos mil trescientos
son doscientos dólares en taxes mensuales
bueno un un condo y todo eso ya viene incluida la asociación
no es aparte
es fácil
entre taxes y homeowners a lo que sea tu mortgage agrégale trescientos o cuatrocientos dólares facilito
que es el el homeowners insurance y todo
pero eso añadido a todo a todo
assessment
how much
es que esa comunidad ha habido demasiado vandalism
yeah but not only that
pero since she was behind
she had to pay attorney's fees
that's why
so
y entonces ah el abogado que fuiste a ver si
sí
ah sí no de eso forget it
attorney fee and everything te lo digo por experiencia propia
yo perdón
yo pagué unos meses acumulados
y de los attorney's fees no me salvó nadie
pero solamente thanks good it was only a hundred and fifty dollars
it's nothing compare to one thousand whatever
yeah that's a lot of money
pero
it happens
so vamos a ver qué pasa con el market
i hope things change
solamente en la ciudad de miramar hay mil hasta el mes pasado mil novecientas casas ya en foreclosure
before foreclosure pero ya
ya al momento al instante ya
eso va a hacer
y eso ya va a hacer hasta el año
pienso yo hasta el dos mil nueve
hasta ver qué pasa
pero yo
tú fuiste la que mandaste el el el email que decía que él es terrorist
qué era cómo era la palabra que me dijiste
ninguna cristiana
sí
más sin embargo mucha gente la critica
y me da pena
ay sí
vamos a ver qué pasa con las elecciones porque de todas maneras por último lo que más da pena es el futuro de los niños
que ultimadamente ya uno viejo como sea pues
ya la vida está hecha
pero vamos a ver qué pasa
oye
tú que pasas metida in the internet all day
i'm looking for something con las tres bees bueno bonito y barato
vacation
i wanna go to the caribbean or
whatever whatever is a good deal
for all four of us it's the first time that we're all going on vacation
well not the first time
no no but i wanna take them to the caribbean because mariela is always telling me
she has this girl in school that is her same age
and she tells me that um
oh my friend aby that she tell she tells me that she's been on a cruise
and i can't wait to go on a cruise
and i always wanted to be in in a cruise
and i can't wait to go on a cruise
on the cruise no not on the cruise
yeah
no last year we went to new york and i took them
yeah no but when i went i've been going to the caribbean
and into las vegas i went only with alberto
so i wanna take them this year
i was also waiting for the baby to be older
which makes it easier for all of us
even though i don't think he's ready yet
but i'm gonna take him now
yeah i know that's why i was thinking maybe maybe we can take like maybe like another
you know my brother's working in the caribbean
yeah he's working in the caribbean
he flies like every three weeks
he goes to costa rica
or he goes to mexico because he's you know he's a mortgage broker
what he's doing is he's doing loans but in the caribbean
these properties are like one million and up
pero son propiedades un sueño
so when he stays there i can easily go
so i have to pay just the airfare
they have good deals pero
they have even nine dollars
but they catch you on the taxes
or they catch you on the on the way back
like they give you an eight dollar ticket to go there
pero con los impuestos and then the ticket coming back
lets just say that the going tickets is eight dollars
and then the return is like a hundred and twenty plus two fifty in the taxes
ya son three hundred dollars
times four
that's what i'm saying
since you're always on the internet if you see something you know reasonable
not really because it's it's it's on vacation time
it's peak time
it's summer time
i've been looking for something
for a while
really
why
i heard your mommy is coming next week
a homestead
ay no le va a dar dolor de cabeza
why you're gonna take her there
i've been i've been there when it's cuando alberto trabajaba en coca cola
no te he contado
carlos got a new job
sí
bueno
bueno no
él va a ser empleado de general electric
he is gonna be an employee for general electric
but he's gonna be working for msnbc
yeah
so he is a general general electric employee
pero he is gonna be working for m s n b c telemundo
of course
of course
he's very happy
it's a good base salary
and you know they they give them up to twenty thousands dollars in bonus which is not bad
pero tiene sus pros y sus cons
the problem is that they don't give him a car
so he needs to get another car
yeah more income
but at the same time it's like it's another it's an extra expense that we have never had never
it's like having
the way i see it it's like
oh my god they just throw us a baby in the house are you gonna take care of diapers formula because it's a insurance gas maintenance
eso es lo que me tiene medio
no ahorita la verdad es no no sabes que
no lo quiero ni pensar
tampoco lo no lo va poder manejar un mercedes ni un carro tampoco de lujo
so vamos a ver
en eso estamos
así que si escuchas de algún good deal because en el dealer donde él está hay carros
pero so un lexus o el equivalente
sí
where
está en infinity
infinity
es para él
to that effect que se compre mejor un lexus donde él está pues
so
it's either money or credit and
the credit is not all that
because they offering him a big salary
of course
sometimes you gotta give up certain things
like all the jobs that he's had they they's always giving him like you know company car
but now they're not giving him a car but they're giving him a good salary
so we'll see what happens
but if you hear something good too you let me know
whatever you know just let me know
whatever you hear
whatever
oh speaking about that victor no se puede hacer nada
i've got a this week
it's impossible
because they're gonna ask at the time their closing they need to see the original driver's license
al momento del cierre
not only that because i can send a to his house
that's not the problem
the problem is that the person who is closing needs to see the i d
i know
i feel bad for him
but unfortunately i can
i tried mira que yo he tratado
i tried
pero bueno no se puede no se puede
qué cosa
bueno porque no a todo el mundo le gusta que lo graben cuando está hablando
el día que que me pidieron que hiciera el el el anuncio la grabación para ese ese anuncio que iban a hacer de de la historia de la señora que tuvo el problema de seguro
yo no quería hacerlo
lo hice por lo hice porque mi jefe me dijo que lo tenía que hacer
y porque no tenía otra alternativa
pero
sí sí bueno no porque no lo tengo
porque se lo llevaron a españa
y
la caro no ha regresado
están de vacaciones
hasta mañana mañana
a sí la semana que viene
sí
y no lo al lo alquila no lo
sí seguro
no
no pero tal vez consigue un roommate
madura
no por qué puede conseguir ahí a otra señora que esté en las mismas condiciones
ah bueno
y qué pasó al fin con la de méxico
con la
pero que estaban tratando de poner el museo como una entidad a parte no
de las diferentes
otras cosas que no son museos
pero entonces ella tenía la dirección de todo antes
y si le dan los museos estaría reportando a la persona que está ahora en esa posición
ah todo es parte de la universidad
en octubre que te vas qué una semana
lilian bueno pero en tu cuarto porque lilian está viendo la otra película
que tengo hambre
bueno será eso o pasta porque
pero
si pero yo a esta hora no voy a poner a cocinar algo
por eso te digo que o salimos a buscar algo o hago pasta porque pasta es rápido
y los niños
chicken kitchen
del de la señora del museo de méxico
que te dijo que sí era
pero tienes que bañarte antes
sí lo lo que no le pareció
no se quiere bañar
mirna quería venir porque pensó que si venía a hacer esto le iban a pagar
sí pero con quién va a hablar
no
dio
y porque tienes que ser en español
que antonio y y y diego son bilingües
no
no porque porque entender medio entender o medio leer algo no quiere decir que sean bilingües
pero si nosotros grabamos todo en español qué tiene que ver con con ser bilingüe
o hacer lo que estás haciendo que tú hablas en inglés y yo te contesto en español
y tú crees que podemos tú crees que podemos hablar por treinta minutos
yo hablo cuando cuando hay algo que algún tema que a mí me interesa
yo hablo
pero a ti te desespera cuando yo hablo porque quieres que me apure
no te gusta cuando yo empiezo a
no déjame hablar
que a ti no te gusta cuando yo empiezo a dar detalles y a contar y esto y el otro
tú quieres el punto
tú quieres que te dé las bullet points
y que te diga esto es así
y ya
no porque entonces
no
pero eso es pero eso es parte del del de la narración
que tú vas creando como un suspenso
para que te pongan atención porque
entonces ahora yo de ahora en adelante no se los digo
fulano se mató porque se descalabró en la motocicleta
ya
pero yo siento que no te va a interesar porque a veces cuando yo te cuento cosas que me interesan a mí yo te veo la cara que a ti no te interesa
y que estás sólo escuchando sólo por educación
es que cuando comiences con lorenzo a veces no me interesa
pero ese es mi trabajo es parte de mi vida
yo paso ahí nueve horas del día
y te lo y te lo cuento porque quiero compartir algo que que hago yo durante la mayor parte de mi día que es importante para mí
yo te lo quiero compartir
y a ti no te interesa
entonces después qué te voy a contar
que vine aquí a cocinar
que vine a lavar ropa
que le di la comida al gato
que
si pero yo no te interrumpo cuando tú me empieces a contar cosas por ejemplo de de estas
o de a o de a tampoco te apuro
aunque no me interese aunque no me interese yo no te voy a decir
bueno y entonces y
yeah what's the point
como me dices tú
tú a veces no me dejas ni siquiera contarte la historia
tú siempre me estás apresurando
no
porque déjame contarte déjame contarte la
no pero no es que me preguntes
es que a veces tú hasta con las manos tú haces así para que yo me apure
como sacándomelo con cuchara
bueno pero entonces ten ten impaciencia porque cuando tú vas a ver una película de dos horas no estás ahí desesperado para ver cómo termina
porque tú lees libros aburridos
no pero
a parte es que tú me cuentes algo a las diez de la mañana a me lo cuentas a las once de la noche que ideas no aguanto más
no estoy bien
porque cuando yo me acuesto en la cama ya en cinco minutos estoy del otro lado
porque se quedó en negro
y nunca lo arreglamos
no lo pintaste
y lo que pintaste fue allá
cuando se salió el agua del del aire condicionado se manchó allá
pero esto es lo del baño
tú pusiste qué
aquí
no sé
no creo que siguieron creciendo
pero la mancha se quedó
eso hay que pintarlo o arreglarlo
bueno ahora tenemos que repensar qué vamos a hacer con los dos mil dólares menos que estamos recibiendo del del income tax
yo pensé que
yo pensé que iban a ser cuatro mil
no porque habíamos pensado hacer el baño hacer el techo
si
pero no es sólo pagar sino que dejar de gastar también
con quién
solo
maíz
ah hoy estaba leyendo en una noticia que salió en el periódico
creo que del perú
que que para
parece que el precio del del trigo está tan alto para hacer pan que ahora están haciendo pan de de harina de papas
porque sale más sí pero sale más barato que hacer harina de trigo
pero eso fue en méxico
sí pero no puedes hacer tortillas de papas
yo te di
yo te el otro día
que hiciste
pero ahora lo puedes pagar con la tarjeta no
es que son dos horas no más o menos
un documental de dos horas
si
no
sí la apagué
qué cosa
no pero si no tiene nada más que hacer tal vez
y cuánto es que que cuesta la entrada
diez dólares por ver un documental de dos horas
pero qué son
de sobre qué
cómo historias cortas
ahí mismo en ese lugar
sí no que hay que hacer
hay que hacer
lo que pasa es que cuando tienes niños tienes que buscar alguien que te cuida a los niños
si no tienes alguien que te los cuide de gratis tienes que pagar
y sale caro pagarle a alguien que te cuide tus niños
a juanita
y ann también se puede quedar ahí no
donde carlita
o tal vez sea esa ilusión de carla
yo no creo que que dejen bueno
pero el otro día que que supuestamente el fin de semana era dormir donde jenny por su cumpleaños la mamá dijo que no porque ella había sacado malas notas
sí
si
a ti no te dicen que no
no
tú eres charming
paula tampoco
cómo no
siempre es ay noah no sé que
sí
ella siempre es amable contigo
todas son de lado
está
no ahora no lo hagas niño
se va
eso está bien
deja deja que eso va a soltar polvo
por favor
y la otra no igual
la otra está sola igual
tú le dijiste a mauricio
la covacha
covacha
sí
levante
a quién le dijiste eso
y teresa no tiene una amiga soltera
recomendable
para mauricio
sí cuando le la le de vueltas
y después la deja
pero cómo es que el dice el dice que no quiere ningún compromiso
pero en el fondo él quiere encontrar a alguien con quien compartir su vida o no
o pretende quedarse soltero el resto de su vida
no
yo creo que él quiere encontrar alguien no
pero si comienza con que no quiere nada con nadie entonces nunca va a encontrar a nadie que vale la pena
y
sí
sí pero eso no es eso no quiere decir
él él lo que tiene que hacer es ponerse claro
qué es lo que quiere
quiere seguir de picaflor hasta que sea un viejo verde sólo saliendo con una
bueno
un viejo picaflor
o o quiere eventualmente encontrar a alguien con quien el quiere casarse y formar un una familia
pero entonces claro que que se defina qué es lo que quiere
no es que la primer mujer que se le va a cruzar por enfrente se va a casar con él
y no quiere decir tampoco que a los tres meses de estar saliendo con alguien que se va a casar
pero que tenga la mente abierta que no sale ese pánico que le da que que solamente de mencionar la palabra matrimonio se friquea
ah bueno si no quiere que le están jodiendo que no se case
porque tú siempre dices que así es que yo te jodo mucho
pero lo piensas
y yo y yo te leo la la mente
acuérdate que yo sé leer la mente
sí
medium rare
medium rare
alison
ah sí
muy lindo
no sé
no vi qué hora era cuando comenzamos
por es por eso lo que te digo que tú crees que tenemos suficiente de qué hablar para llenar treinta minutos
sí es triste
no tenemos de qué hablar
no sé si es porque llega un punto en que
no creo que no sea que no tengamos de qué hablar
sino que vamos seleccionando las cosas
o deseleccionando las cosas que creemos que el otro
por lo menos eso es lo que me pasa a mí
que ya yo sé qué cosas que a ti no te interesan
entonces digo yo para qué se para qué voy a hablar de eso
para qué se lo voy a decir si es como que si se los estoy diciendo a una silla porque ni fu ni fa
no porque ya yo he tratado
y no te interesa entonces para qué
como cosas del trabajo por ejemplo que yo sé que en cuanto te empiezo a contar que de la convención
o te empiezo a contar que de de del un proyecto que estoy haciendo algo así es como que se te va la atención por ahí
y entonces
y entonces en cualquier en en cuanto tienes la oportunidad se cambia el tema
entonces después digo yo
sí pero una no siempre está
por ejemplo por ejemplo yo no siempre estoy de como de humor
para hablar de cosas así abstractas
a veces quiero quiero contarte de lo que me está pasando de lo que me preocupa o de lo que me emociona o de lo que me interesa
sí pero si yo te empiezo a contar algo que a mí me interesa algo que me que me preocupa entonces me regañas
sí que tú te preocupas mucho que te eso que te lo otro
si te cuento algo que a mí me interesa por ejemplo del trabajo entonces o te pones celoso porque sí
sólo de lorenzo sólo de lorenzo
pero es que lorenzo por allá
y tus cubanos aquí y tus cubanos allá
entonces como que como que se me quitan las ganas de de decirte
no es que te esté hablando de los cubanos
es que eso es parte de mí día a día
entonces
and how much did he charge
and how much would it been if we went and got the gauge and the and fixed the creepy crawly up
and the gauge thing the pressure
this is the bill guy
did you ask him about the pool heater
or you didn't ask
and what about installing installing it
or paul
yo no quiero contar con él

ten to twelve days
wednesday
he they said ten to twelve
eight to fifteen business days
today counts as a business day
so we went on thursday
yeah we went on thursday
so today is the eighth
today is the eighth so any time after this
what time do you have to be at the workshop tomorrow
there's no traffic
seven twenty leave at seven thirty
but does julie know if you can apply then for mentoring points
so if you go to the workshop you can
so she's mentoring and she's gonna be able to count all the points
there's no way you can do ninety from now to march thirty first unless you're sleeping with the person and living with the person
maybe they'll the last batch
oh you just ninety hours of mentoring
no hay duda de eso
and the truth of the matter is you have
and i'm giving you mine
i was telling gloria
no
i will though
um i was telling gloria that after i stayed with janet till ten o'clock at night you know and we're late and everything uh she e mails me today
i'm not gonna be able to video the second lesson again
you know i'm just what i have
i don't know if i told you that
and i just didn't respond
and i told gloria because
hundred percent if she's not gonna give herself a hundred percent
it's not worth it
i have enough to do
i've to work on the fricking formatting crap
it was very minor what they told me i had to change
centering a page
margins a no sé qué on the appendix
what that's what the college
in the college of education they hire mrs dr blap to do that
but they submitted my dissertation with those formatting issues because they knew that it would still pass for the defense
some of the catches she didn't catch
and she caught things that they didn't catch
qué
oh
two weeks ago
when we had the music playing
i was thinking that i don't know mary siempre se fastidia getting all the drinks
we should get
did you saw that orange gatorade thing from when you're coaching
we should every now and then have
que these kids need to drink
and they probably go into mary'seng house i think all the time and drink
we need to be supplying our them with drinks
o k they have not
uh
and why do the why does it have to be grass here
pebbles mulch
then do it because ahí no va a crecer nada
look it it it the shade is completely covering it
and you never know if birds have eaten the seeds
they don't see worms either yet they eat them
they dig into the ground to get a worm
she has something in her tail
y rosa hoy dijo que la iba a bañar
ella luce limpia
ah
she took her in the morning like she was gonna bathe her
milagro que marga hasn't come out
huh
she's coming
i didn't think anybody was gonna be at work today
i thought was just gonna be me and rosa
and i even told rosa i was gonna get there at tennish
pero no hubo tráfico so i was able to go straight
and and that's it
go in f i u
and picking up the thing
there's no traffic
no but susie was
susie was yeah when i got in the door was unlocked and how weird
i thought everybody was gonna be out today
that's what i had heard that everybody was out
es que she gave everybody the day off except for herself
which is fine
we made a lot of progress
all day
the morning was getting ready for the meeting
basically it was c c's integrates
i gave her the ideas
pero she
complicated them
if that means complicate then yeah
you know these are meant to be for teacher assistants and they're supposed to be non threatening low prep you know emphasizing
and i had told her you know do something on conservation because there's water
i given her
long story short it was very complicated so
i had already gone through them because supposedly that's what i was gonna do yesterday
so then in the morning i went through them i made copies of everything and then i also gave
for example one of the reviewers had recommended a book in the lesson of displacement where the water is displaced
uh called the crow and the pitcher
it's an aesop fable
eso mismo
a e s o p
it has an a
a aesop
you know the crow and the pitcher
anyway it has to do with a crow who wants to get uh drink some water from a pitcher
but his beak doesn't go inside
so he needs putting little stones in until the water rises enough he can drink it
and the thing is using your wit to get whatever
but it's a lesson on displacement which is exactly the second lesson
ruby used it
so i showed
i thought i was alone
no pero rosa las chancletas
they're cute
they match my ear rings
no but she was talking to me about the other day
and i was like

como que medio se le notaba pues yo decía este maje es este maje es loco
pero pues nunca le puse mente
no me lo voy encontrando en discoteca el sábado loco
a la puta bróder si es que es
casi tan loca como carlos bróder
tal vez un poquito menos
no lo que pasa es de que carlos es así de naturaleza
este maje o sea él caminó
carlos es así de naturaleza creo yo
carlos
carlos es carlos es es loca de naturaleza
o sea este maje era como que andaba vestido todo o sea oímelo de camisola
o sea una camisola blanca con una corbata azul
o sea loco o sea pero era una una camisola de esas fruit of the loom loco esas camisolas haines loco
y y después un jeans la gorra azul digo la la corbata azul y una boina azul verdad o sea una boina militar azul
loco
las cejas casi tan mariconas como las tuyas
y unas uñas más largas que ivy queen loco
no o sea
es que loco en las uñas me fijé hasta hoy porque ahora hoy estuve con o sea no estuve con él sino que estaba había un un evento en la universidad
y entonces el maje estaba platicando con una una amiga mía y yo estaba ahí
entonces el maje unas madre uñas que se carga a la gran puta digo yo si es que se va a transformar este maje loco
y ahora y ahora ahora que lo estuve observando bien pues sí de viaje se le nota loco
de viaje de viaje se le nota
no no no no no pero nunca nos hemos dirigido la palabra jamás jamás jamás
o sea yo como
yo como que este maje es loca digo yo le voy a empezar a hablar
pero no sé el maje y yo yo trato como que tal vez no de meterle conversación
pero por ejemplo hoy que estaba hablando con mi amiga yo también me puse a hablar con mi amiga y el maje seguía ahí
y entonces yo lo miraba al maje como para incluirlo en la conversación como para decirle ok like i'm talking to you me entendés o sea we're talking to to both of them entonces
pero el maje como que no me ponía en mente
así que su madre tampoco o sea todavía es que me gustara
sí pero yo estoy tratando de que sea mi amiga
sí
se aprovechan de mi nobleza verdad
sí bróder se aprovechan de mi nobleza
qué te
qué te iba a decir
y no has hablado con con alberto
desde que te vinistes de dónde de new orleans
el maje se rapó
se mira se mira bien
y anda y anda la la barbita y todo se mira bien
y yo estúpido huh
estoy ahuevado loco
te conté que corté con mi ex no pues con con el que andaba no
sabés lo que me dijo hoy bróder
que nunca me amó loco
sí
no sé
no que va a estar resentido bróder
o sea me dijo que como que sí te quise mucho y pues estuve con vos porque pues o sea estuve con vos con mucho gusto me dice quería estar con vos
pero nunca te llegué a amar me dice
nunca te llegué a amar
y yo puta bróder y le digo
o sea tú estás te te das cuenta de lo que me estás diciendo
le digo
sí
me dice
yo sé que te estoy haciendo daño
me dice
pero prefiero por lo menos estoy siendo honesto con vos
me dice
le digo puta pero qué mala onda le digo
porque el maje siempre me decía pues que me amaba y que no sé cuanto
y después cortamos en noviembre
y después en diciembre que yo llegué me pidió que regresáramos loco
y me dijo como que
hoy te amo más que nunca
me dice
hoy estoy más seguro que nunca de lo que siento por vos que no sé cuanto
y y todas esas cosas me entendés
entonces yo le digo le dije hoy pues que estábamos chateando le digo yo por qué entonces me dijistes todo eso le digo
no sé me dice estaba confundido me dice
pero pero no sé no nunca llegué a amarte me dice
loco vos sabés que es eso loco que que me pase otra vez eso
no espantoso loco
por lo menos por lo menos este maje sólo estuvo todo sólo estaba conmigo me entendés este maje de alberto pues
estaba con vos al mismo tiempo que estaba conmigo
y supuestamente me decía que me amaba cuando en realidad te amaba a vos
pero ah
un huevo loco entonces es como que más decepcionante
pero igual loco yo de este maje estaba enculado loco
y lo sigo estando loco sigo estando enamorado porque uno no se deja de enamorar de la noche a la mañana
pero pero que me diga eso bróder puta me me me duele en puta loco me duele muchísimo muchísimo
o sea me me hiere como persona me entendés
me siento o sea me siento super ahuevado loco porque
no sé me entendés o sea al al principio cuando cortamos cuando recién cortamos pues yo le dije al maje como que
todavía me amás
le digo
me dice
no ya no te amo
me dice
pero pero sí te quiero
y entonces yo me quedé
ah
entonces yo me quedé pensando como que
a la gran puta
decía yo
qué rápido dejó de amarme
dije yo
y y o sea me me empecé a sentir super mal porque porque dije
a la gran a la gran puta qué qué fácil que es olvidarme a mí
qué fácil que es superarme
y dejarme de amar
decía yo
y entonces se lo dije al maje hoy o ayer no me acuerdo
le dije como que
sabes qué
le digo
voy a ser honesto con vos
y y me siento mal
le digo
de que o sea me hace sentir mal el hecho de que me has dejado de amar tan rápido que no sé qué y que no sé cuánto
le digo
y y y y puta le digo
me haces sentir como que soy una persona tan fácil de olvidar
le digo
una persona tan tan like que que se supera se supera así de fácil
le digo
entonces me dice
no
me dice
que no es eso sino que nunca te llegué a amar
me dice
loco y que me lo diga con esa frialdad me entendés
o sea es que
sí y sabés qué el maje ahora está viviendo con pedro
está viviendo con pedro
no no cállate
o sea al principio el plan era como que nos íbamos a ir a porque yo me iba a regresar a nicaragua a vivir
entonces nos íbamos a ir a vivir los tres juntos
así como roommates me entendés para que like saliera cheaper me entendés
saliera más barato alquilar un lugar
y entonces como que yo les dije
vayan adelantando ustedes pues vayan pasándose y eso
y like a los majes les gustó la idea pues
y entonces like los majes están viviendo juntos pues ahora
y ya ya son roommates y eso
y y no sé loco
ayer ayer me peleé con pedro por victor y
porque sí porque el el maje de pedro me empezó a decir como que victor le empezó a contar pues de que le gusta un maje ahí que no sé qué
y entonces yo como que
contame contame
y el maje me decía no que no sé qué no puedo contarte que no sé cuanto
y yo
puta pedro vos nunca me habías dicho antes no puedo contarte
o sea porque pedro y yo nos contamos absolutamente todo like absolutely everything me entendés
like cada detalle incluso our sex lives me entendés nuestras vidas sexuales
hablábamos como que nos contábamos detalles me entendés
y le preguntaba como que
y te la metió
y se la metiste
cosas así me entendés
y entonces y nos contábamos así sin vale verga me entendés
y entonces el maje
no que no sé
entonces siento como que el maje ahora se está volviendo se va a volver íntimo de de de de mi ex loco
y y yo me voy a quedar mordiendo el leño loco
y entonces le dije como que
ok pues
le digo
no me digas nada
ya está pues
está bien pues
no me digas
le digo
entonces me dice
ah no yo
me dice
no me vengas con esa verga que no sé cuanto
entonces le digo
cuál verga
le digo
a mí no me hables así
le digo
no seas por la verga
le digo yo
sabes qué
nos vemos
le digo
y lo bloqueé bróder
me me me hizo sentir mal loco
porque el maje me empezó a decir cosas como que olvidá a víctor ya me dice olvidálo ya
ya este
ya no es
yo no le
sinceramente
me dice
yo a ustedes no les veo un futuro ni lejano ni cercano
me dice
olvidálo que no sé cuanto
entonces yo le decía
pero por qué
le digo
like si me lo estás diciendo it it it's for a reason
le digo
si me estás diciendo que lo olvide
le digo
es por algo
entonces me
hasta o sea le tuve que que decir y decir y y hasta que lo convencí que me contara
y yo nunca había tratado yo nunca había tenido que convencer a julio para que me contara algo
like él me contaba las cosas right away me entendés
entonces
no no no no no i understand me entendés porque me lo dijo
o sea el maje me dice
no le digas nada
no le digas nada
me dice
porque es que porque si le decís
me dice
y vos sabés ahora estoy viviendo con él
me dice
y no quiero crear conflictos entre nosotros
and i understand that me entendés
pero pero o sea yo le dije como que
no no te preocupés
no le voy a decir
like pedro sabe de que cuando nosotros nos decimos no digas nada nosotros no decimos nada me entendés
o sea y que me lo haya dicho así tantas veces
pero no le digas nada cuidadito le vas a decir que no sé qué
o sea me hizo sentir tan tan tan mal like he didn't trust me any more me entendés
me me hizo me hizo me hizo sentir bien por la verga loco
entonces lo bloqueé
y no sé me siento como resentido con él loco
no sé bróder
me siento me siento me siento todo ahuevado like toda esta situación está
like por ejemplo este maje de manolo bróder ayer fuimos a cenar
y y pues fuimos a cenar y todo de a verga me entendés
pero like plan bróderes me entendés
and i really like him me entendés
el maje me gusta
y y todo o sea el maje me gusta físicamente
y como persona porque es una persona de a cachimba el maje loco
pero el maje todavía está pensando en su ex loco
o sea sólo son ellos dos me entendés no
y y ni por porque ya ninguno de los dos sale me entendés entonces
entonces ella como que no hay
no hay
o sea tampoco así pues porque los majes se han aislado completamente pero
pero pues no dejar que nadie se meta me entendés porque la gente siempre le encanta meterse en las mierdas de uno
apliqué con este maje de de ryan me ayudó por teléfono
pero me dijo que todavía no iba a estar contratando hasta no sé cuándo
sí estuve en el teléfono con con laian un cachimbo tiempo bróder
pero te pegan unas puteadas loco
no si yo también un amigo me estaba consiguiendo para taca
me entendés pero
pero pero bueno ideay
se llama moncho el maje
y después de eso nos fuimos a la casa de filberto
el otro maje que andaba ahí con nosotros en bahama breeze
y ahí estuvimos pues
yo pues ahí me quedé a dormir y todo
pues supuestamente íbamos a tapinear pero al final yo yo no tomé pues
entonces pero igual ahí me quedé a dormir
después el sábado nos fuimos ahí a la casa de manu
y ahí estuvimos pues toda toda la tarde y toda la noche pues jugando board games y y jodiendo
me entendés
aquí pasé encerrado
y nada más
ni sé qué día es hoy
y y a mí pues que el ruto no me no me no sé lo mastico pero no me lo trago
pues yo a fred tengo siglos de conocerlo
yo lo conozco desde high school me entendés
y pues no es que sea mi bróder ni nada
pero pues me me cae regular pues me cae bien
ves y pero este ruto no sé no me da buena espina
y como que
no sé pues
la pues
si if it's good for her
me entendés le
si ella si ella lo quiere y eso pues
cosa de ella me entendés pero
like no sé pues como que como que se está alejando de mí la maje por por salir con el maje me entendés
bueno idiay cosa cosa de ella me entendés
she knows de que i'm gonna be here whenever she needs me pues pero
hablé con no después de bahama breeze hablé con ella creo que el siguiente día que que salimos filberto manu y yo
pues dijo que sí que iba a ir con nosotros que no sé cuánto
y la maje como que hagamos algo bacanal algo desturque que no sé cuánto
y entonces todo todo de a verga pues
pero después la maje como que no sé me estoy desanimando hagamos algo chill

entonces ya después al rato
no sé vamos al cine
me dice la maje
y yo

le digo

y esa película pues para nada que me llama la atención
al final creo que terminaría terminaría yendo a ver step up two
le digo
pero pero seguramente pues va a ir ruto
y pues you know what i think
le digo entonces
entonces la película pues vale verga al final pues la voy a terminar la la voy a terminar de ver por vos
le digo
pero sé que va a ir ruto
le digo
entonces prefiero mejor
like para sentirme incómodo para qué me entendés
entonces le digo
pues disfrutala pues pasala bien
y la maje como que ah ok que no sé qué
y nunca más ni me volvió a escribir
ni ni a llamar ni ni verga
entonces como que
o sea es que el no sé like están pasando un montón de cosas en mi vida ahorita
es que como que me están están cambiando mi mi mi mi vida y mi rumbo me entendés entonces
no no tengo reales para eso
con eso lo estoy de a verga
eso no lo suelto por nada del mundo
i would rather dejar mi carrera a un lado por quedarme en univisión me entendés like
pero siempre andan como con mil seguridad bróder
y esta vez los majes andaban como pedro por su casa
entonces they were like more available
entonces pude tomar fotos pero la cámara siempre le anda

para que no para que se sientan más cómodos pues
y no sientan que tiene que hablar inglés
me dice pues
me voy a me voy a ir a fuera a leer
se trajo una revista el maje

él ni él debe entender el maje lo que estamos hablando
tal vez están tratando de de ver cómo cómo se comunica la gente me entendés para para dar una clase platicada

algo así me dijo el maje

that had to have been there when i went outside
that i went outside to smoke for a minute
and then i came back in
and he went outside
and he goes estaba buscando

and that's
i i had to go to four different places and i found i the ah pinch a penny over here on bird road
they said i had to order it
it was special order
that they don't keep any of those things any more
i went to home depot the home depot next to where paulo works
they didn't have it
they didn't have even those um those liners from landscaping
i went to walmart
they didn't have it
i went to the other home depot across the street from walmart
they had it
and they had one and i hope it'll be big enough to be able to do it but it's black
it's a black liner
a blue liner a blue pool liner
you know
no i don't think it's gonna matter but you know as long as it's it resists as long as it resists at least for for tomorrow night
you know
and ah so i'm hoping that that'll that'll do well
where
i i will
angelo'seng homily was very innocuous
um everything went well
i spoke to father hank
he went in
he was all nervous because we were working today together
and he said
you know i was reading about what had to be done
and and and and i go
look
i said
chill
he goes
you've done it before
i said
i've been doing it for ten years
ok i said
don't worry about it
i know how to do everything
you concentrate on your homily
and ah and he goes
do you wanna preach
and i go
no no no no you're the one who's preaching
and he goes
no because you know i'm me i'm preaching on the sunday already
and i go
i'm preaching the easter vigil
i don't need to
i said
that's one less thing i have to worry about
well you go ahead and and do that
and then he was ah he goes to me
oh congratulations on your new position
i hear you're gonna be vice principal of the school
and i told him
yeah
and he goes
oh you're gonna be working with sister maria
oh she's so wonderful
yes he loves sister maria
he says
she's so wonderful
she was the vice she was the principal at ah little flower um when i was there teaching c c d
and she's just such a wonderful person
and she's just so nice
and all this other stuff na na na na na na
and i told him
you know you would have been good for the for father derrik'seng position
yeah
so anyway
so let's see
and my mom says she's gonna go at three
for the stations of the cross
and then she's gonna stay at four for the good friday service so that you can go at seven and you can leave her the baby
ok
so
and esmerelda wants to go because nancy'seng gonna be baptized there
so um
maybe my sister will take care of him
maybe he'll even sleep there
well why not
pick him up on sunday morning
how's the coffee
i was getting kind of tired of the creme brulee
ok what time are you leaving
oh so that would mean you know tomorrow or something like that
i'll pick up just a little bit
i'm not gonna pick up the whole thing
ok
i mean esmerelda'seng room is disgusting
she needs to pick that up
and paul'seng not here
i imagine he went to work
y tengo un dolor de cabeza de este tamaño
i am i'm gonna take some
and as usual
as usual every time easter comes
and i have to do all this stuff in the in the parish
i get sick
me dio una entrada de patadas anoche
i don't know how many times he kicked me in the bed
no it was me
it was me
he was kicking me the whole time
i didn't sleep very well either
i was waking up at three and at four and at five
yeah i know you did
you were snoring
and quite loud i might add
and paco was snoaring really loud too
so anyway
i'm gonna go drop that off at the motor home when i leave for the parish
bueno de qué más quieres hablar
the one that has that problem
she goes to me
oh because she's coming back to work
just get transfered from one place to another and the school system is doing the same thing
right they're more scared of the lawsuit from her the employee than the lawsuit from the parents
who's this
oh ok yeah
right right right that she was in that school in
so then tell them that they have to leave again
even the principals and stuff right
put her put her with six grades six grades
oh that's right
put her put her with fifth grade students
then she'll leave
y ellos no miran nada los los papeles y los expedientes de la gente
but at any rate didn't they get somebody to replace her while she was gone
and so what happened when this woman came back
good
y todos esos chiquitos hablan
but this is from your school
where are you going
ok hurry up because i don't want you to leave your brother out there alone
y ésta es la misma que fue acusada
so she doesn't she doesn't give a damn about the kids
bueno
es los niños
absolutely
yeah
i think katie is gonna start in a school in june
well i don't know if she's resigned
but she hasn't signed the contract yet
but um i think they started calling people down to sign their contracts on thursday
i mean not thursday yesterday
yesterday was wednesday
but yeah yesterday
no yesterday was thursday
no wednesday
i'm sorry
they started calling um people down
so i imagine that they'll be calling her soon to go sign her contract
and then the nun said that er to see if she could be coming in you know at some point maybe for like a week or something
just to see how things are
and then and then probably start in june to try and get the
it may be better for her not to
they are gonna come to me
no mi papá me lo dijo
mi papá me lo dijo
mira alégrate de que no le den trabajo ahí a paul
y y esta chiquita bueno ya está ahí
no paul uff
a paul lo van a botar de varios lugares si no se cuida
what i told her is
get your certification
in social studies so that you can work at at a public school
and then she told me
no janet was saying that in ferguson there is gonna be openings for six new teachers in every department
and i go
well there is your entry right there
you know
and she said
yeah but you know i don't wanna work in public schools
and i go
well you know what
if you work in a public school you are gonna make more money than what i'm making right now
ok
and i said
so go ahead
and start doing that
and the only way you are gonna get fired is if you do something to one of the kids
come on
he's such a jerk
i can't stand him
how do people like that get jobs
oh that's the one that you caught going through your desk over here
at at at the other one
that's just amazing to me
that's the thing that's the thing with my school since we work on contract
you break your contract you're out
no no i mean here they you know we try to help you out
you know we'll put a mentor
we'll give you ideas
we'll talk to you but if it doesn't improve you're out
you're out
i wish they would do that with the kids
you know
because the parents in essence sign a contract with you know with the kids when they get there which is the handbook
you break that you should be out
oh no no no but the kids continue to go
you know
it's just i don't know
it really bothers me
i'm looking for a rough year next year i'm telling you
it's gonna be rough
i have the teachers on one side expecting me to do everything
i have
i don't know
yeah i'll tell her
bueno not her i gotta tell sister
para el año que viene you know to put him on schedule for to go and celebrate mass
because father derrik used to bring people all the time but that was him but now father nichols is going to be doing the same thing so
i'm hungry
tú no tienes hambre
i already had my coffee
i'm hungry
viernes no se puede comer carne
that sounds pretty good
pero bueno
estamos conectados
i guess we could hop in the car with it and go get it
it's portable
do you want to
just hop in the car and go get some pastelitos
yeah he could be baby sitting
he's outside right now
i mean apparently he's keeping the kids entertained
ay mañana es día de del carajo
i don't know what i'm gonna do that paper on
i have no idea
what ethical dilemma do i have in my place of business
let me see
i hate my boss
i think she's a hypocrite
ah my ethical dilemma
the fact that i'm choosing to work with her closer now in my new position
that's my ethical dilemma
i don't know how i'm going to work that out
esa mujer todavía no me ha she hasn't given me back my grade on the presentation
and it really bothers me that peter got a the same thing that i got
because everybody was saying it
everybody got a twenty on their presentation
i mean come on
my presentation was a hell of a lot better than a lot of other people's there
i posted i sent her my thing on monday the day right after class and it's friday today and she still hasn't posted my grade
she did
she sent me an email that she received it
yo le estaba diciendo que que hay gente que
yo le estaba diciendo que hay gente que que que lo ve extraño
hacer esto
maría que me estaba diciendo que
sí pero yo creo que porque no conocen porque no saben que
no no no sé no sé
no sé
no no es tonta ni nada pero
bueno a mí la verdad que a mí no me gusta mucho tampoco
did that come out already
but where is it
ah pero ya regresaron
oh en parís
me dijo yo te dije no te dije que esta muchacha mary smith
mary smith una una chava que viene
no una chava ella es una señora mayor que vive en londres
se va a mudar a parís
y ella trabajaba para el exploratorium
pasó como veinticinco años trabajando para el exploratorium allá en california en san francisco
no se qué pasó entre ahí
pero ella terminó en londres trabajando en londres
pero no sé si hay museo de ciencia ahí
y luego ahora se va de londres a parís
me dice que tienen un lugar
no sé si lo lo se lo están alquilando bien barato o algo
y que tienen un cuarto a parte para nosotros
para llegar
no cuando tú quieras
cuando tú veas un viernes que yo llegue a buscarte con una maleta atrás
ya tú sabes que te vas
pero ella me dice
sí i i have a room
no
ella no porque es un apartamento no
un roommate
ella está un poco verde para
sí un poco cómo se diría
madura
no sé
no ella no no tiene necesidad
no tiene necesidad
yo creo que siempre ha sido soltera
digo yo
no sé
yo creo que siempre ha sido soltera
ah yo te dije pero te estabas durmiendo
ella me dijo
mandó un e-mail diciendo que le había que había otra persona en la dirección en lugar de ella
no
todos los museos
es que ellos dividen los museos
están museo de las ciencias museo de la luz y otros dos
debe ser un complejo muy grande
entonces ella está viendo
ella estaba ella estaba en la dirección de universon
que no no sé si en eso quiere decir que son todos
yo creo que eso quiere decir que son todos
está en universon porque tú vas a la página de universon
y luego hay eh hay donde uno puede apachar para ver eh el el de la luz el de las ciencias las diferentes
entonces ella está viendo si le si lo separan
y ponen todos los museos bajo de ella
y lo que me quiso a dar a entender que la dirección general está como aglomerada
que no sólo están los museos bajo la dirección esa sino otros
otras cosas
que no son museos
entonces ella viendo que si le dan los museos a ella
parece
parece parece que hubo
no sé
o o o le dan la otra parte
y le dejan a ella en paz
es que eso es una ciudad ahí adentro
es la unam
todo es parte de la universidad
por eso es que queda un poco raro la forma en que está organizado
entonces nada pero entonces pero me dijo que no que no tenga pena que allá con mucho gusto llegan ella e edith
yo me dio a entender según como leí yo que era ella e edith
so i don't know
i hope
eso es en octubre
en octubre no unos cuatro días nada más
cuatro días
i thought you were watching the movie
yeah
yeah i wanted to watch it together but it's alright
sabes qué antonio pon el calentador

yo le dije
yo le dije
qué más
no creo

pero yo honestamente no pienso que una persona que ellos son bilingües
en el sentido
no creo que son bilingües
que la
por eso yo digo
yo no tengo ese no es el concepto mío del bilingüalismo
i don't know
i don't know
he didn't tell me
they didn't explain
it might have it might have it might have something to do with the something else that has to do with an attribute of bilingual people
that doesn't necessarily have to be do with the actual language that they're speaking but
i don't know cadence
i don't know
i i can't imagine because i
o algo así pero no creo
la verdad es que no creo
yo lo estoy haciendo interesante
a que estudien
si tú no es que tú no hablas
yo hablo
tú no hablas
no no no no no no no no
es que
no es eso
es cuando cuando quieres decir algo
primero me dices

y luego empieza como fue que llegó a matarse
ya que me dijiste que se mató
huy chica me no me tienes me tienes que decir cómo se murió
y tú también eres así
no dime no dime
no quiero no quiero el suspenso
y entonces yo te voy pidiendo los datos
no
pero
pero muchas veces a ti tampoco te interesa lo mío
no pero hay otras cosas por ejemplo
número uno cuando yo te te he llevado al museo y te he mostrado un trabajo que haya hecho a veces te interesa a veces como que
no estoy hablando de interrumpir
estoy hablando de interés
yo sí te dejo contar historia
yo a veces pregunto
pero tú te pones brava que yo pregunte
pero no es algo fuera del normal que te pregunte
no es fuera del normal
porque quiero saber
no
pero no es por apurarte
es por querer saber cómo termina la cosa
qué tiene que ver porque me interesa saber cómo termina
ah no
por favor yo te cuento de lo que yo estoy leyendo un libro
y estás dormida en dos minutos
y yo no me enojo
no hombre
no son cosas muy interesantes
no estás bien
y cuando yo empiezo a hablar se te va la onda

es de lo que está de lo que se trata
el primer la primera parte del libro que leí sobre omnivores'seng dilemma

en esa cosa azul tú dices
comenzando con no sé si hay de eso ahí

ya tenemos que mañana llamar a
llamamos nosotros
o dejamos que antonio pide que es por ejemplo antonio

y y lilian
entonces tiene
ellas están ellas dos estaban tramando de hace un de julio
pero lo que pasa
por eso por eso
no es seguro con esa mujer por eso no quiero hacerlo ya
bueno entonces tú llama a la otra entonces y a la juanita
para asegurar el negocio
sí
lo llamo yo
no me dicen que no
juanita no me dice que no pero
no sé no sé
esa paula no no me para bolas
jamás
cuándo tú has visto que
esa paleta está de lado
está de lado
pero están de lado esta estas
yo lo veo más de lado
no va a soltar más
yo lo limpio
yo me paré ahí a limpiar el día que limpié toda esta casa
qué te iba a decir
no esa gente no me para bolas
tal vez la juanita porque la pobre
mal servicio sí alguno
y me ve ahí trabajando y con los niños y eso
le da cosa porque son mujeres
no es cierto
pero la otra yo creo que se mueve más
trabaja
y tiene la la mamá ahí
debe tener quien le dé amor
ese mauricio no la vuelve a mirar ni a
no
no eso es un muchacho
mauricio tiene otro concepto completamente
ah hablando de mauricio estábamos mirando
lilian puso
no sé dónde lo encontró
una una página electrónica parecida a la que yo busqué en washington para ver dónde ir a pasar el rato
y decía ahí los lugares donde se puede ir a escuchar música latina y bailar
estaba hoy como ayer que es que los dos queremos ir a ver cómo es
eh bungles que se convierte en en cosa de baile después de no sé qué hora
y la coacha
entonces yo le dije
bueno yo no sé la coacha porque dice teresa
covacha
y yo le dije
yo no sé pero a mí me parece que eso es para ir a buscar
yo leí en inglés que es para hunting
es for hunting
que ahí va a cazar mi mi amigo mauricio
a ver si se la prestan
a teresa
yeah
y no sé si si lilian me me hizo mucho caso
para
no lo sé
es que yo no le puedo echar nadie a mauricio porque después quedo mal
no
es que él no trata de darle vueltas
él trata de de de de ser claro
trata en lo posible de darle impresión de que él no
pero todas las mujeres aunque están viendo que el hombre dice
yo creo que él
no sé
es que ya está
mira mauricio él ha siempre ha sido como de mente como de persona mayor
de de
y ahora que ya está medio maduro peor todavía
él está muy muy acostumbrado a lo de él
no un viejo verde que eso es es discriminación
picaflor todo el mundo tiene derecho
no creo que se friquea
yo no creo que se friquea
pero no quiero no quiere estar no quiere que lo estén jodiendo
no quiere aguantar locura
no quiere
por qué tú me jodes
yo jamás te he dicho que tú
sí
ajá ajá ajá
el medium
cómo se llama la chava esa
cómo se llama la chava esa
alison
alison plaza
seguro que
y seguro que
nombre
choca carro
a saber que
porque él debe gozar de eso
pues sí han pasado
en número
a ver
sí
a ver
creo que aquí dice veintiuno
pero no sé si se está cambiando ese número
no sé no sé
nunca hablamos tanto
pero eso no es triste
pero por qué no tenemos
pues porque somos feos
o que somos
de repente me interesa
qué cosa a ver dime un ejemplo
pero hay otras cosas sobre qué hablar la filosofía la política
pero tú puedes decirme eso
no porque todo te preocupa
no pero todo te preocupa
de hablarme de los cubanos
sí
the purpose that ah for this meeting today is for um to make ourselves independent from the county as far as the testing ah
yeah he was there
yeah but what's the purpose for the meeting
the purpose for the meeting is to
eventually
i don't know if you guys know but from um they're gonna start giving us a c j bat test at work
yeah
the um the classroom is gonna be set up as a testing area
and i'm sure you're gonna be involved with that
um
yes you are
no
well but
yeah but does he has to set up the software
no that's the system
mhmm
they're gonna do orientation
ganan dinero
i don't think so
yeah but that makes sense
taking the test first
you don't think so
but mason in a way it's better because if you pass entonces you know you have the capabilities you know
well
no
entonces lo que vamos es que hacer es que cuando ellos vengan hacer el c j bat
tú vas a tener un log que ellos pueden poner su nombre
y tú la preguntas ahí did you apply already on
yes or no
then they have to go and apply
go online
pero i don't know why are they doing that like that
yeah but that's that's gonna cause a lot of problems
if the people that you're having come in for the c j bat have not applied in that's gonna delay more your procedure
why what but why is it gonna be done like that
why not give them the orientation first
and then the c j bat test in the afternoon if they're interested
i mean doesn't that make more sense right
for them to have the orientation
let them see what it's about
see if they're interested
and if they're not interested they don't come back in the afternoon for their c j bat test
ah oye y anota ahí que esa fue idea mía
that was my idea
cuál
oh right right
and now they're accepting
but all these are state certified um
bueno pues yo sinceramente pienso que deben de tener la orientación primero y después el examen
definitivamente definitivamente
i'm not qualified
right
exacto
no no no no no
pero mason but but you have to say that to him
i'll say that to him
that doesn't make sense
eso no tiene sentido
van a gastar papel
it's gonna go in the garbage
and you're gonna get people that after they take the test are gonna say
oh this isn't for me
once they hear the orientation
no that doesn't make sense
and how much does
listen
that test how much does it cost us
a person
ok so once again why would you have the person spend the money you know why should we spend nine dollars for somebody that after you have the orientation might not even be interested in the position
that's not cost effective
eh that eso no tiene sentido
boy i i would have gotten into a good argument with him with that if i would have known that
para que quieran aplicantes
van a hacer van a hacer la academia hasta abril y hasta diciembre
what did you say landon
what are they gonna do
oye things are bad
things are bad
oh my god
but that makes sense i mean you know
it makes sense because we're the ones that deal with it
and we know what you go through you know
ah the larger the file the more time it's gonna take you to do everything that you have to do
yeah they're gonna have a job opening for every month
three hundred
i don't think you'll have that many
five hundred people
y tú no ves como un cambio o que viene así como de muy lejos
tú no ves como que va a haber un cambio de algo
te voy a decir
ay yo no sé
ok
you know why because you know why because i was told to teach daniela everything i do
i'm trying to put two and two
together
tú no sabes que lo que van a hacer
sí pero fíjate que a ti todavía no te han puesto el assistant ahí a trabajar
cuatro o cinco
i don't know either
where
where are they doing
but they they set up meetings
they set up like sign ins and stuff
i don't know
do you see it
do you guys see a list
so what is it they take when they go to these recruitings
so who gets that list of people signing up or whatever
so how do so how who is seeing that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing
sentados ahí
and who were these people
oh well that's right
i remember when last year they came from spain or something
que había unos españoles que habían venido
i remember
oh my god
oh that looks good
oye eso sabe rico
es algo de lana
lo de lana parece yo no sé qué cosa es
una frazada en vuelta ahí
but what is that actually
qué cosa es eso por afuera
pero es un taco
thank you
ay thank you
no vamos a salir de aquí con olor a comida
i i'm gonna smell like a fried ah chicken
positive
some people have to do an application three times before they can get it correctly
before it can go through the whole screening and downtown screens them and everything sometimes three times they have to do it
thank you
coger una cosita de
no but listen listen mason
you know what was funny here in this meeting
there's this man sitting next to me from t e t s c
very he's like very intelligent you know
and um he he gives us this whole presentation in paper with diagrams and with ah pictures and
i i mean like nice presentation
well the lieutenant took over the presentation from the beginning to the end like if he had done the presentation
it was incredible
the guy didn't say almost i mean i think that if he said four words
yeah but
and the rest of the stuff
he put it all in writing for us and everything
yes
yeah he did
we were laughing about it now in the car
le dije
teniente no dejaste a este pobre hombre hablar
dice
ay es verdad que it was noticeable
él dijo
yes
no but you know what got me
that he wasn't aware of all the problems that you were going through
everything that you were doing he had no idea
but you know i think that the bottom line is that because we're just one department that's having this problem the county is not gonna change the whole frigging system for us
you know what i'm saying
no way
oh did i say a bad word
i mean really
that's how they look at it
they're not gonna change the system for us
well because of the type of position that it is ok you have to keep um tracking it for everything
mhmm
no tiene que estar tracking cosas
oh my god what color was it
uh oh
and that's not the only test that police officers take
they do the polygraph
the they do the the what the medical stuff
what's the other thing that they do
no el assessment
really
you mean they're not gonna do it at all
or somebody else is gonna do it
oh like part of the training or something
do they get support for that now when they do it
so this is better for them then
no
i think they're testing for common sense or your common sense
how you're you know how would you react to different situations you know
yeah
do people actually fail that
they do
i think they should definitely also implement the fact that they should be able to see their c j bat scores
or maybe automatically when they finish with the c j bat test an email gets sent to them saying
you got a seventy
you got a whatever
now no
not with the police officer position
with police complaint officer and police dispatcher they do
you can actually go into um miami day dot gov and to the testing site
and it'll tell you pass or fail
it's not gonna tell you your score though
but that's because
the county is the one that sets up those appointments
that's why ours don't they can't be seen
oh my god
qué es eso
oh
no
that must that must be a puertorican word
because i've never heard of it
dime cangrejo then i know what you're talking about
crab
la quería lo quería matar ustedes de verdad
por poco te mata
but you take it out of the shell
mhmm
ay pero yo me mira yo me he reído tanto
la ha pasado más bien en el carro con el teniente ese
porque yo no estaba enterada de que el sargento esto para él es una nueva experiencia
él nota
exacto
y entonces el loco ha sido administración
nunca ha hecho eso
so él está como como
what's the word that i wanna use
florentino
and he's such a nice guy
pero he doesn't know his way around downtown
entonces
no
y el teniente dando instrucciones
para acá para allá para dobla aquí
vete para allá
el qué sé yo
él haciendo el caso todo lo que decía el teniente
digo y yo creo que no tiene opción de no prestar no prestar atención a lo que está diciendo
that's why i said i don't think you have an option
entonces después tiene que park
y entonces nos empezamos a fastidiar
dice
ya me están poniendo nervioso
no voy a poder parquear
ella nos iba a invitar a almorzar
pero como sabemos que hoy íbamos a hacer eso
ha ido con él vaya
pero es que yo que lo que el teniente estaba diciendo
yo que leí que el teniente de verdad que él le había hecho de verdad un graph de eso a él
y yo lo quería complementar complementar
y lo que hacía era hundirlo
entonces yo le dije
well you're really a nice edition
it's a pleasure having you in the department
i can see that you're
he's just so nice you know
and you can see that he's interested and that he wants to learn and he wants to you know
mason how do you do this
how do you do that and this and that
wow
entonces yo le digo
yo le digo
pero de qué parte tú vienes
porque yo me estoy dando cuenta de que tú no estás familiar con ninguna de esta área
hasta por aquí
estaba como medio perdido
ay dios mío dice
no es que a mí me tenían
ay dios mío
él se ve que es buena gente
eh

hmmm
y dónde se sienta él en eso
al lado de smith
el otro es más serio
pero este sabe que es un que es una persona humilde
sí
sí
no lo he tratado todavía
dice teniente
entonces yo le digo yo le digo al sargento
mira you're doing a wonderful job
yo no estoy muy segura de lo que tú haces
pero yo me doy cuenta que you're doing beautifully whatever it is that you're doing
y dice él teniente
oye yo creo que tú estás invitando al sargento a almorzar
dice entonces dice un dicho que si luces bien yo no sé qué cosa
no te preocupes que tú luces bien so

now i know what to do
yeah i think new york is old
i need to clean it
but now i know how to play
yeah we did
but i guess he still got nervous when he was in the car
and he likes to stick his head out the window
sí
no because we put it really high high enough for only his head
sometimes he might put his feet
but he can't get out
no it's about um
his hands could touch the top
and his it's as high it's high enough for him to put his hands
yeah i hold him
but i think that they're they're high enough so that él no se
chill
yeah but i don't think
because he sees people all the time in the cars
mhmm
he's seen one before
i know
oh
i don't know
yo creo que es una pasión
it's like it's a passion already for me
i
we did
pero it was completely different
it didn't work out
they didn't they changed the entire game
pero for the first time
in my old school
yeah they did
and tú sabes it wasn't the same
pero now i actually get to go into a team where i got i actually get to play the game
and you know i was so nervous
because i wasn't sure if i was gonna be able to you know entrar el team like if i was gonna make it
because i was because i was around so many like awesome players
y ya fueron
she didn't make it
i don't know
i think it was because she wasn't doing so good
i'm not sure because maybe that's what they thought
pero i thought ella fue like very good
sí fue buena muy buena
maybe it was because
i don't know
maybe it was because that she had her grades low
because if you have an f or maybe more than one f you can't go into the team
maybe
but maybe that's not the reason
maybe they just didn't like her
or maybe they had better players
we have to practice every day uh every week um school day
monday tuesday thursday and friday
i mean monday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday
monday tuesday thursday and friday at seven forty five
and wednesday
yes
ah no
no probably mami and papi
well there will be other girls that are on the team there waiting
she'll be coming in at the same time
there are teachers coming in at that time already
yeah but they're not there outside
they're inside preparing for school to start
yeah
and we're outside
well we go through the bus loop
and the parents drop us off there
and um
where they where the bus is for for the kids that go on the bus
they drop the kids off
uh
no the and on the other side
ah
oh no no no the other side where they all where all the buses are
yeah
that way we're closer to the school
and i don't have to walk that far
it's an hour
so if i start at seven forty five i end at eight forty five
i don't think so
yeah the school clothes
no we just stick them in our book bags
jean and a polo shirt
we have we are gonna take the shorts and any type of shirt with our knee pads
yeah
you're crazy
yeah but that's not the same
because if you go on the floor you can really hurt yourself with those
yeah
that's why
yeah
no
only wednesdays and maybe on the weekends
bueno we're i'm probably gonna have to start eating at the school
mhmm
only wednesdays you you can make me lunch

i feel bad for him
the man
uh not really
he's a police he's a fireman
he's um in shape i guess
he's not fat
nor is he skinny
he's just buff
i guess
sort of
i work well i'm currently employed by
i have my broker
he's a real estate broker
my attorney he's a real estate attorney
i work for a title company
i work because um
my attorney consolidated with the broker
he owns both businesses
but like his business partner he's the broker
and his business has been so bad they consolidated
so now i work
for both of them together simultaneously
they just pay me you know four hours one pays me the other one pays me four hours a day like that
but i
i'm like the office bitch
people can say
pardon my french
but um i do everything
i answer phones
i get the mail
i order supplies
i babysit the realtors because they don't half of them don't know what they're doing
they don't know any of the forms
they don't know anything
so i'm a administrative assistant
i'm a receptionist
i'm a post closer
i am the head of the post closing department
i deal with everything that has to do
once a deal closes like when you buy a house
you would go to a title company to do your closing
to sign all the paperwork
after that i do the package
i send it to the bank
i deal with you know funding conditions
then i'm the one who prepares the policy
i do recordings
you know i send the stuff to be recorded to the court
yes
i do a lot and
it's in doral
but um
yeah
do you know where the mall of the americas is
and the walmart
it's by there
yes
you know where chevys is
no
right where are you from
right
ok
and do you live
but where
you have to tell me a place because
you know how women are in directions
you have to give them a landmark
yes
can we use bird bowl
bird bowl
you've been to bird bowl
uh
er
ninety second
yeah
ok
yes
i've inputted
oh wait i haven't told you
job description
what i told you is pretty much you know the receptionist the administrative assistant stuff is mostly for ok both companies do that
post closers for the title company
i also process files like when they come in a new file you know request title
ok then for the the broker um the realtors don't have to input their own listings i input them for them
so if a house is going up for sale you know they bring me the listing i input it into this m l s it's the system or whatever
and um
most of them don't know what they're doing
they don't know the forms
it's it's really bad
because i
if you see i have so much to do that when they come to me and they tell me you know how to do their job it annoys me
because i don't have time to babysit them
what happened
yeah
and then um like if i have if i have to go to the bank to do deposits
yeah actually um like last week i had interviewed um back in november i had interviewed with an insurance company and this lady she emailed me she emailed me out of nowhere last week and told me oh you know are you happy where you are because you know the girl that we hired back in november she has been promoted
are you you know interested in and i was like
i wrote back to her i was like well i'm not really happy where i am and um um she goes
oh no and she writes back to me and she is like oh we're interested you know eleven dollars an hour
i'm like oh really you know
and then um maybe you make more than i do but whatever
no
i told my attorneys and the broker
i sat them down and i'm like look this is what's going on
and they are like oh you know thank you for letting me know
but um then they told me oh no you know we'll raise you starting next week you'll start at ten and then in two months we'll start you at eleven
so it's good because i don't wanna leave where i am
i mean i've been there for two years
i know my job like the back of my hand
and then if i leave to the insurance company i'd be learning everything from scratch
i don't know the people so i don't know if their
the lady seems a little anal
so
my major
undecided
declared undecided but
i want to become an optometrist
yeah
maybe even an ophthalmologist if i go the nerve to go to med school
me too
what's your prescription
you think you're bad hmm
i have a negative six
point seventy five
and then negative five point
no it's negative six point five and negative five seventy five
so if you think you're blind you should have my eyes for a few days
i can't see crap
yeah i can't see anything
so you don't wear
yeah
yeah
well what sucks for me
is that no when i get home i take off my not really before i go to bed i take off my contacts and obviously i have my glasses
but i put them on and then if i take them off and i put them down somewhere forget it i lost them
i can't see them
so i have to like feel around for them so
no i can't see far
i mean you'd have to be like right here for me to see you
oh no i can't
oh no
i like if i was
no if i had to read this like i had to be like like this close
to be able to see it yeah it's really bad
and i'm scared to do lasik
they well they recommend you to wait till you're twenty five
because it's when your vision kinda just balances out
because at first they told me it was twenty one
but i'm twenty one and my vision keeps you know increasing and getting worse
and um i'd say decreasing and then um my doctor he's like oh wait till you're twenty five
and i'm scared because like if they do it and it doesn't come out right you can't go back to contacts
you have to do glasses
so
i don't know
it's something yeah something they do that
if they laser it
yeah but there's two different kinds of lasik
yeah there's lasik and then there is another procedure
i saw it on this show it's called ten years younger
on t l c i think it's
and um
the yes
yeah
i'm a i'm a t v buff
i have a lot of favorite shows
like ok definitely law and order s v u
all the i like all the law and orders
c s i
i love new york and vegas
i don't like miami
c s i miami
have you ever seen vegas
because it's the original one
oh but i love it
obviously
well come on
it's cable
well not even cable because at all
it's t v
yeah
i love it like
i love without a trace
cold case
have you seen that
i love it
i love house
i love house
what's another one
you know what
the the problem with that is that when i watch like c s i and law and order i know it's not real
so once you put me like
if watching the real things it affects me
yeah
so i don't i don't know why
so i don't
because when i was senior year
junior and senior year i got into psychology
and i specially the abnormal psych
and i started reading a lot on um like psychopaths and
you know stuff
did you take a p
i took a p psych
it was crazy
the national was crazy
i got a four which is good
i thought i was gonna fail it but i got a four
i can't i'll go crazy
i'll go crazy along with them
i can't do it it's too much
i'm not that strong psychologically
no
yeah it does
i do i i can't
even with t v sometimes like if i'm watching s v u or anything right before i go to bed
yeah
but imagine just having their jobs
you know
i i couldn't be able to do it
i couldn't be able to handle it
i'll break down like i i'm gonna need like a psychiatrist
like you know all all the like the psychologists go into the psychiatrists
no i wouldn't yes
i wouldn't be able to
i think people
i don't know either you have experienced something that and that's why you're fighting against it
or you're just born you know with that strength to deal with all that you know because it's hard
i wouldn't be able to do it
i think
but the thing is is is not even taking it personally is you know don't bring your work home
right
but i wouldn't be able to do that
right
exactly
you can't it's easier said than done
obviously
and we can't do it
it's like you're trying to sleep and your brain doesn't wanna shut up
that brain chatter is what it's called
i love heroes
aside aside from that kind of show
i love heroes
chuck
i'm an n b c fan
chuck
journeyman
never seen it oh my god
they're so good
bionic woman
life
you seen life
yeah
will and grace laugh
you are not ok
oh ok
i'm very pro gay
so laugh
ok
you don't see it
oh ok
i don't watch comedy central
john stewart is funny
well actually i'm just saying it
jon stewart at the oscars
he was hilarious
like talk shows
it's not a talk show
ok
ok
ok
it's like the soup have you ever seen the soup
on e
with joel
just not as
well obviously it's cable
because it's comedy central
but what show what comedy show do you like that is not on
yeah
like just a regular
you know i like him but i can't
it has to be certain days that i could just sit through a whole show of everybody loves raymond
yeah
like in a show
me like i don't i like comedy like that that it's innocent and it's just everyday
but like raunchy comedy like people that use like i don't know sex or insults and stuff like that i don't think that's funny
no because i
have you ever been to the renaissance festival
ok well this is the renaissance
yeah
it's in um where is it
it's further i don't even know because i don't know directions
but um quiet waters park
it's is it penbroke pines
i don't know it's one of those that you have to drive a little yeah
so it's a renaissance festival
and then they have this show
the guy's called christoph the insultor
and basically you pay him to insult you
it's ridiculous the guy walks out with like five hundred dollars worth of people you know
like people would pay for or it's a group that they pick one person
they put money together and then depending on you know how much they give him he'll how long he'll insult the person for
but it's so stupid like i didn't find comedy in it
i like like friends
have you ever seen that
you know friends is funny
and what else is funny
dane cook
well but
well i haven't really seen his stand ups
i've seen his movies like
you know um good luck chuck
well that that was pretty raunchy ok but
that's what i saw
ok but
i think that
it is yeah it's bad
but did you see um
you know the part that i busted out laughing
the part when she goes like this
and then he's like what happened to you did you get in a fight with a stamp
you know that part is
i think that part was so funny
it was all unexpected to me and i cracked up i was
i hadn't laughed like that in a while
i just saw it the other day
but i like comedy like that
family guy
you know i don't
i if i watch it alone
i don't find the humor in it
i don't
maybe it's just
but if i'm with other people i see i don't know
right
i guess maybe it's so in my face that
i don't get it laugh
right
ignorant
right
like me i watch it and i don't laugh
like maybe i'll smile whatever but i won't laugh
like i have friends i have a group of friends that are addicted to family guy
and then when they talk about it and they say things that they say in the show
i laugh
because they make it funny and because i don't see the humor
i see the humor in what they are doing
i love stewie
yeah
yeah i know who they are
stupid
ok
well
you lived in hawaii
wow
for how long
was it beautiful
is that illegal
family guy
you know
i guess i don't watch a lot of comedy because
it doesn't
i don't know you can't gain knowledge from it
not really because i love comedy
i love laughing
but
if i'm gonna put time
yeah i wanna learn something
and i
yeah
because in comedy you really don't have to figure out anything
you know
yeah yeah
like in a murder
like
i'm not quick
right
right
i think that's my problem
ok
ok
right
what
you see i wouldn't get it
because
you know yeah
i wouldn't i wouldn't catch onto it
i guess that's why i don't find it funny
i have to have someone next to me explaining these things so
my uncle was there
during i think it was the second world war
no i lied
i don't know
he was i know he was in the military
and he was stationed in hawaii
uh um i've only been on cruises
i've been to cozumel
in mexico
i've been to grand cayman island
and ocho ríos jamaica
well the city itself
fifteen
the city itself is not pretty
like it's nothing
to look at
i guess
i mean the beaches are beautiful
but um we climbed the the dunn's river falls
it's like i don't know how many feet
it's the
and then you climb to the first two hundred feet of the falls
and you have they yeah they have guides
that who will guide you
and you need you know the water socks to go up
because the rocks are slippery you know
on the water
the water's freezing
it's the coldest water i've ever you know
it's just the waterfalls
it's freezing it's freezing
it doesn't matter how hot it is outside the water it would always be freezing
and um there was this couple that they didn't go with the guides
they decided to go up the middle
retards
and they fell
they slipped
and they fell down i don't know how many feet
and they had they on a rock
and they had broken ribs
everything they were full of blood
and it was crazy
huh
yeah at least
but it's it was pretty
and then that part was pretty
but the city is
like and then guys offering you weed
yeah and then you see like them wrapping the weed on the plants
i don't know i don't know
huh
no
i find it gross
do you
i don't what else what else what else
and then in the second one we went to saint thomas the virgin islands
we went to the bahamas
to atlantis atlantis
yeah beautiful
it's beautiful
and where is the other one
and dominican republic
and then in in the united states well i've been to orlando
who doesn't go to orlando
tampa have you been to disney here
yeah
i've i've been to universal and i've been to busch gardens
busch gardens and islands well islands is universal too
i've been to cooperstown new york
i've been to the baseball hall of fame
that's where it is
i've been to
we went to north carolina on a road trip
we stopped one night in atlanta
so that doesn't really count
because we we never we didn't stay there
where else have i been to
well spring break i'm going to virginia beach
huh
v a beach
yeah
that's what they call it
ok v a beach
that's where i'm going

it's gonna be cold over there
no it's my cousin's fifteens
and she lives up there
no i won't
no
i am actually going this saturday for the like the first time to a club
no
um i guess there is more to life than clubs
well um well i was when i turned
música de todo
i like everything
it just depends on the song
if i like it doesn't matter the genre if it's country if it's pop rock anything
as long as i iike the song
like the thing was when i was when i turned fifteen i met this guy
we were together for four years
and he was very machista
and he isolated me from everybody from my friends
and i mean it was my fault in the way that i allowed him to do that
but um
it happened
and then we broke up
well i broke up with him
thank god that was over
and the friends that you had when you were fifteen you know people change
in four years specially those years from fifteen to nineteen you change a lot
and i i tried you know to go back to those old friendships
but it wasn't the same
obviously you can't expect to find the same thing you left four years before
and obviously there's grudges from people you know
you leave
and
but i like the movie
yeah
a murder
yeah
they were like living like normal
yeah but they're crazy they kill people like
pero exactly that's like that's killing people
because there were still some survivors left
i know they they adapted
adaptaron a a la vida de ellos
i got it
i wanna see it i wanna see it
the movie yeah yeah
i wanna buy it
yeah
i wanna see it
so yeah
hmm
oh really
oh but
yeah but they can't do that in the movie
because all all the monsters look like they look like zombies
and the other people look like normal people
so like there's no way que ella se puede pasar como humano si se parece como un zombie
well - remember he had that girl on the bed
yeah

she forgot i went
and she goes
oh maria went with me to the meditation

and it's cute and everything
and i go
but they actually idolize a living person
come on
oh you didn't go to the meditation centre with us
oh my god sam
it's beautiful
let me tell you
the the meditation thing is is just gorgeous
but it's a lady that i heard about when they read they read things
and um i read it in a magazine in new york
people actually go see this lady
and they bow down to her and everything
she's like a god
and in this place they have candles and pictures of her
and the people light candles to this lady
i was like
there's something wrong with this picture
i would never like do that
hi baby
so i was like
they are doing worse
you don't
how do you how can you do that
you know
but i heard that the lady is like really like um not like gandh
but you know
so people from
él dice que new york
when the lady goes to new york the lines are out the door
unbelievable
she thinks she's the pope
for that part of
maybe
yeah that's a cult
to me that's a cult
i felt like
i mean the meditations were good
yeah but that was like a cult
the place is really nice
they are very quiet
it's beautiful
you take off your shoes
it's all red carpet
it's beautiful
but cuando yo entré
y yo vi todas esas fotos de esa mujer
la la foto de la mujer
entonces they put flowers
and then they put and they put candles
and i'm like
what is this
and then i ask her then
and then at the end i go
who is that
you know
i'll tell you when they were having the food is awesome
it's all organic
you know like whatever
yeah yeah
awesome food
and it's not expensive
so i was like
who is that
and then she tells me
oh that's
and i go
oh i read about her
and one of the things
but i was like
why do you light candles to
no because she's like our
not that she's anything
but she's like the head of the thing
y no sé qué
and i was like
mm that's wrong
i mean
i'm sorry
but you know
she's still living
why are you lighting
you know
i mean we light candles
because i like candles
and i pray for everybody but
no no that's not
you are idolizing
yeah you are not supposed to idolize anything
that's one of the first things god says
i'm before everything
and when you put a when you put a picture especially living person
you know
right the mexicans do
no and the mexicans in that thing they they honour on death day or something
yeah they put the
yeah they put the candles
and they put the things for them
and they do
you know
to bring them back
and they put everything that belonged to the person
and they put it on the thing so
it's cool
subway passes to where to new york
yeah but you know what she bought i told you she bought that pass
it's a special pass that they give
um
it's a special pass
it's called something and it gives you also discounts to certain museums in new york
it's like a
yeah con ese pase you can you know you can use it and you can you have certain discounts
but it comes out more expensive doesn't it
like i would
was she gonna give it to you
i don't know
i don't know because i saw that
they talk about it
it's called something
it's like a a supersaver i don't know what
and i was like why do they keep on referencing this
i wonder what it is
yes for the subway
it's for the it's it's for that
but there may be something different that she bought
because this one serves as as a as a thing for the subway
but it also gives you if you have that card sometimes you can get into certain museums and things like that
pero bueno i checked out the prize and i was like if we are just gonna use
it's like using the metro here and you buy the annual pass it comes out cheaper

fifty dollars
he's like i would wanna go
pero there's a whole bunch of restaurants participating
what i wanted to ask adelina was
i've never seen it before
maybe like i bumped into it going home since it's on my way
and i noticed that the streets are closed
but i wanted to ask adelina because they have a list of
it says it says that they are gonna be serving
there's gonna be wine right obviously
but it's gonna be
exactly from from this place wild oats or something right
espérate
but then i'm saying fifty dollars
and are you gonna get hors d'oeuvres
but then i went into the restaurant section
and it has all the restaurants participating
so i'm like bueno is each restaurant gonna have like a booth that you can sample their food porque está flemmings ahí
ok or are they just gonna pass the stupid hors d'oeuvres and that's it por cincuenta pesos
no hay manera que tú te puedas tomar
bueno they're gonna have premium drinks too
you know
but i don't know
i wanted to go
but then rafi was like
but then we had we left the girls yesterday to go to do the taxes
so rafi'seng like
i don't know if i wanna leave the girls again you know
so i don't know
i don't know
i have to ask her
y después que le grité hoy
it's only for two hours anyway
we are gonna be right there
you know
because he says
it sounds good i've always wanted to go
i always wanted to go to the one in south beach
but the one south beach is so expensive
yeah it's really expensive
and they keep on and they keep on
they keep on hiring the prize thinking that people are not gonna go
and more people go
yeah
and here but here in here in miracle here in this one
they have a v i p for one fifty
that you go in the tent
and i don't know what they give you
is adelina here
sharon
el el food festival ese
ellos dijeron que iban a dar appetizers at wild oats
pero hay comida
entonces todos esos restaurants that are participating will have booths
and they are provide food for you free
oh ok because if they're just giving appetizers
eh
no they have a list of the restaurants that are participating
it's just in the little thing where you buy the ticket
it tells you no eh you know the wine and premium drinks and hors d'oeuvres from wild oats
i'm like
sí pero they have everything más o menos
but still i mean you know it's hors d'oeuvres it's just
i mean
i'm sure they probably have a sampling no
que everybody has
yeah but you are paying for that right
that's probably what it is
ah bueno pero mientras que todo el mundo tenga

all you have is under the general section
eh
y la canción
you can just go and pick
qué
qué pasó
i did mine already
old news
old news
we should we should say all the main questions in english all the nice questions in spanish
how do you how do you say how do you how would you say like officer in spanish
and um there was a there was a staff like a huge staff
i forgot the the name for the the actual emblem
but it's ah it's it's it's some some particular thing uh that signifies the legion
you know that signifies the caesar
and it's called the
yeah so like he told me about that
i was like
yeah it's pretty cool
like i didn't i didn't know that
um
yeah so
that's the thing
like like like like if
but as you get lower on the curve or higher on the curve they start to converge
fascist italy and communist soviet union not that different you know
so it's what's the difference
you know it's it's a it's a state governed
yeah well it's not state it's government you know
it's it's management
i mean yeah it's whatever you know
so
i was gonna ask you about the about the gun
i was gonna say backlash
and it's it's like it's the weapon
and it's like the
what do the other guys have
i mean if you have your target in place i mean you want to unleash
do it
go full auto you know but
you know just kind of like
and he said he says he's down to to um to oversee today's proceedings with todd and stuff
like i didn't talk to him too much yesterday about it
i just brought it up but so
yeah we can role play
we can you know
you can be the officer
so
i got nervous today man
i went i went upstairs
i need to get there early on wednesday
because i was like
like i got a like i got a little nervous you know
so
i mean i think it's just jitters that are gonna go away within like five minutes
i just need to like breath in the musk of that room you know
i saw the woman
i saw i saw the director
i i didn't see like i didn't see the dark force
it's like i don't want anything from her i just
or wouldn't give you an answer
i i i think i think i i think we need to kill her with kindness you know just
i mean like you know very
you know i haven't i have no problem being kind to the police
i mean kind to whoever
because this is all about survival so
survival i will l will like i will shake hands
i will like do whatever it takes
because when it's all said and done you know i can hate whoever i wanna hate at twelve o'clock at one o'clock
i'm twenty five years old
like i can hate whoever i want for the rest of my life
like these three hours are are big
so
i mean i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be anything above and beyond courteous above and beyond respectful
i mean i that that's that's my main thing
i wanna be respectful
because because again like whether whether the the officers
i mean i'm i'm i think she deserves respect just as an individual
but whether the officers deserve respect or not is not a matter of intrinsically
it's a matter of in the proceedings
the proceedings have to be treated with respect
because given that it's so wishy washy given that it's so shifty and unstructured respect is gonna factor in
watch me crack my fingers
and just calm down
and then i ask a question
and todd asks a question
i don't think you're gonna you're gonna be allowed to ask like consecutive questions
it's gonna you me todd you me todd like that
ok
so which is good
because then you know you're thinking about your next question
and then i'm thinking like uh
he's a you know he's an inebriated
and then he's just like he's vacant like his whole face is just like
he's like he's just like
beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
but i think i think i had in spanish
it's like like
i mean how do you say
you know it's but it's like
like the the that compound in english
you know it's just like you're not going to find that in spanish
trash can
you know it's trash can
like in in a in a in a in spanish it's just like no it's like it's one item
basurero
so you have uh again like a professor of french say french professor
whereas in spanish you don't have that
if you say if you say profesor francés
in english you have that ambiguous ambiguous possibility because of the the way you can put place um uh modifiers
like just thinking about all this crap
like i don't have my test results yet so
you know like
like i i was actually telling marta that like you know the way the way i cope with any of this
she still doesn't know about wednesday
but the way i cope with any of this is that i i take it
like i told her
you know it's
i mean unless like i get screwed over you know
like because like my whole idea is that
like had she been here had she been here i would have told her
because i told her about the event
i told her that evening i spoke to her
i was like
oh like this shit happened and whatever
and she's like
oh that really sucks you know
but i just never brought it up again you know
like i never told her when i got hearing notice
i never told her about any of that you know
um
actually i have my own copy
this isn't you know even supreme
but
that's the the main like entrance door
ok good
ok thanks
there you go
with these two people
and then we'll just mimic the other side
and uh and i i remember this long lost like spanish term you know which was uh which was vacilar
vacilar
because the thing about vacilar is that it it means it means to take in visually
o k
it also means to have fun
so it could just mean like it's like it's like being merry you know or having fun having a good time like living it up
you know
it's not just visually
it's not it's because you see you can't directly translate it into checking it out to checking out like i checked out that girl
you can't say like i checked her
it's not quite the same
it's i am i there there's an aspectual there's an aspectual component
aspectual means like there's a there's a it's a it's more complex
so it's not just i went to the store it's like i have gone to the store
so you have the complexity of of perfective tense
yeah so vacilar is like i i am checking her out
and i am in the process of checking her out
so i am taking her in
it's like i am drinking i am drinking her sight visually
i am drinking the sight of her
it's like
but it's just like i i took her in
i didn't just check her out
it's a it's a it's a it's a renewing process of checking out
it's like checking out for an extended period of time
taking it all in
it's it's like a full it's like it's like a it's like opening up the lense you know like to you know the slow slowest shutter speed
just letting letting the entire image you know like
it's
it's it's a it's a it's a serious word
i'm just like like there's no equivalent
checking you out i'm taking you in
taking the sight of you in
you know i am comparing you to like the you know the schema that i have in my head
all these things are contained within that one word
and i see this woman you know
it's like then i just like turned
it's like it's like this word just a word you know it's for this you know for like the type of
because like we checked her out on the way there and on the way back like
because we had to use the u turn
it's like
it's like i'm i've taken this woman in
you know like various aspects of her of her of her personality you know like you know visually visually
purely visually
like
you know like hay que vacilar like
you know like take in life
you know take in a a joyous activity you know
so
it's a it's an inspection mechanism
and you lose some of that pleasure
you know like the there's there's pleasure in sight
you know like i look i look at a mountain side and like there's no pleasure
you know it's it's like a shape
you know it's it's shapes
um and and the only thing i'm trying to do is figure out how it all works together
i don't get that that hit you know
but like remembering that word and remembering and like and like i think like that that doesn't happen to me with women at least
you know like certain things certain things like really catch my eye you know
she was she was friends with him
you met her
i forgot
not that i know of
no
don't worry about it
but uh
i have no idea
there's no need to to do it over and over again
i mean i told him like you know we we should get together after it's all said and done
i mean he wrote me the two letters and stuff
he wrote me i mean one of them's gonna turn into the other one
i guess i'll keep i guess i'll get to read them
because i've never read like any letter that anyone has ever written me so
i noticed
i left it on the same page
because i
i mean i showed you that poem
and then like i left it on that page
i almost get like a certain joy out of it you know
like a slight a slight damage you know like
it's been
i mean i mean i if i had to choose like if i could keep it in perfect form
but i like to bend my books back
i like to write in them
take notes
carry them everywhere
and if i have big cargo pockets put them in big cargo pockets
so
yeah we're trapping police
like like rapid fire like four questions you know
and that's just like that's it's just gonna make him an enemy
you know and it's gonna make the the
you know we want
because i want to give them no reason
they can like
if if we remain calm and then they become agitated like especially the police officer like officer police like
you know or you know or or
just trying to ask a question like
you know i i i don't i don't desire anyone to become agitated
you know so
so if we can make him lose his cool that's great you know
we don't lose our cool
jump right in
have something to say have something to say
because like we
so uh the book is is like you've read the book you don't wanna watch the movie
like the end
but if you when you when you read the book you don't wanna you you say what why they they don't do that in the movie you know
and at the end they put they put like ah como una inyección
se la ponen and like
él podía escoger o una inyección o unas pastillas tomarse unas pastillas o salir para la calle y fajarse contra todo el mundo
he was like like a murderer
for them it was he was like a murderer
yeah como un asesino porque ya ellos tenían su comunidad comunidad ahí
you know
no they don't kill people
they don't kill
ellos no mataban a su propia gente
ellos mataban a la gente como nosotros
you know but
i don't know
yeah
have you seen the the first one
the one that the one that came on the on the movie on the movie theater
that the special edition is the one that comes with the
it's like twenty something twenty something bucks
and
and in the in the in the book
they drink the he drink the pills
ah it's like like you know como que te enfocan que se se fue como que se va yendo así you know
but in the book there is a girl that betrayed him que se hace pasar por humano
y no es humano
es de los los demás tipos
yeah
that's the that's the cool part that they don't show you in the in the in the movie
why
yeah
pero ella se estaba curando en la en la película ella se estaba curando
that one that one se estaba curando
on the second ending they show you like the girl is is like curing is like healthing um
cuando se la va a entregar le da un shot y se convierte de nuevo
dude you you you saw that the the the girl was breathing like like a lot
ella después en el final estaba como más pasiva
y le da algo el tipo le da un shot de de otra no sé qué de las que tenía él
y y se pone monstruo de nuevo
entonces they close the door and that's it
but
yeah
so none of none of none of the endings is is like relative to to the movie to the book
yeah it's like they they got like three movies
but i don't know why they why they can't do the movie by the book
they already they already got the book
ah
yeah
because they because they got a lot of clothes in

nicky's always with

but
kind of
er
yeah that guy is
that guy is awesome man
they haven't put syler like later on
they haven't put him
on any other chapters
no
um that that's the thing about that i was telling you
yeah
what i was telling you that they just put everything in one chapter
on chapter nine is everything
if you see like six seven and eight that's it
you don't have to see the rest of the chapters because everything is is like the same thing
you just gotta see six seven eight and nine
that's it with with those four chapters you gonna see everything what happened on the on the rest of the the chapters
yeah
because chapter nine's is everything in chapter nine's is what happened

the what
ajá
oh sí
ajá
oh
él le dice él le dice a un rey que es lo que lo que le va a pasar
y en realidad le pasa algo al rey
y entonces es cuando la gente se pone
pero that's illegal
esa rotonda es illegal
from what i know
supuesto de eso es illegal
y si y si entra algún camión ahí por ejemplo a dejar muebles o cualquier cosa
yo no sé
cómo va a doblar esa rotondita
porque no está fácil para los carros de uno
no tanto este lado sino el el lado izquierdo
cuando tú entras
pero viste las cositas que compraron para los speed bumps
tú viste lo que van a hacer
tú no has visto una
los bloquecitos esos para ponerlos en el medio
donde estaban las tablitas esas
ajá
sí pero a lo mejor
bueno
pero la calle no la van a hacer no
pero es que yo no entiendo
porque primero se asfalta antes de poner el el la hierba
no que yo sepa
están están gastando doble dinero ahí
y el parquecito viste que van a hacer
el parquecito
no viste que te mandaron una hoja hoy con todo lo de del meeting
it's beautiful

yeah
this is great back here
and this month that is pretty cool
ah but thank god you don't have to worry about a pool
because pools are good for when you have smaller kids but already
they don't even wanna jump in it
most of the houses have pool
ya yo me recuerdo
but you've done a lot to this house
you have done so much
it's incredible
yeah
make it a shower
you don't like showers
oh ok
humidity
para arriba
y aquí antes was half way
yeah
up
and press the button
right
and everything opens up
my friend has an r v
it's beautiful
oh my god it looks like a house
but it's big
you know
and he takes it with him
i mean it's wow
he presses the button
that whole thing like opens up
it's got a master bedroom
and a
and two other bedrooms with a bathroom pretty big
i mean it's really nice
the kitchen is beautiful
flat screen tvs i mean he's got it
because he likes to go to the keys a lot
expensive
space now
yeah because what they do is they build now on them instead of
yes because people are making money selling the property so
they don't make as much renting as they do selling
yes
wow
oh look at the little
es una conejita
oh my god
is it a miniature
no
ay how pretty
i have a friend of mine that has two miniature rabbits
he keep them he has them as pets
and they are little
they don't grow much
and i have some another doctor over there that has a miniature pig
that's the daughter's pet
it's a pig
but the little ones the miniature ones
yeah
everybody has their own pet
good
it's busy but it's good
you know they have more work less people
every yeah because you have to work double so
i mean what we do is they give us like a raise i mean is it depends on how much you make
but basically what it does is then every year they put up the insurances so high
that the little money that you are making
it's they take it away with the insurance so really you are not seeing much
it's just like there's no raise
you know
and i'm the one that pays the insurance because my husband's insurance is much more expensive
yeah because since i work for you know they have a lot more
so you know it's
insurance is cheaper but still
yeah
no that's not bad
and isn't it better for you to go with her with the with the county no
oh i see
oh ok
but my brother my brother was telling me that that that law that came about with the homestead exemption
that he was saying that you know that it's not worth it
he was telling me that so many people from the county are gonna lose jobs because of that
they are gonna take you know they are gonna cut the cut down is gonna be so drastic
and the people what they are gonna save for the homestead is so minimal that it wasn't worth it
and i said well
everybody is looking for a buck
no
hello

la cincuenta y siete no es miami lakes entienden
that's miramar

ok
ok like we were
ah ok
just like after that palmero
that's not miami lakes
navarro
er los burger kings and mcdonalds todo eso para allá es
is miami gardens

ok
que
y entonces por eso le dicen miami lakes
pero fíjate una cosa
siendo nosotros miami lakes y siendo incorporados tú pones
three three zero one four y sigues saliendo en hialeah
why don't we get our own zip code
no porque tres tres uno cuatro coge mitad de hialeah entonces
y cuándo
because i keep telling like if you call a credit card you call somebody and you give them an address and you tell them miami lakes they are like no madam and i ok hialeah
because if not they don't know where to put you know they don't know where to send you the stuff
ok
right

yeah maria is working tonight
and she is off already for er
the schools are off for easter
the universities
pepita no estaba
ella ahora empezó jennie jennie allá
yeah
look yo i found that that that saint thomas started too early
at the same time yeah because it would be atrocious for miami
beach
yeah
you know traffic is gonna get bad all these days now
yeah
the keys a lot of them like to go down there too
very expensive for them
pero let me tell you miami beach is getting to be the same way
before the kids used to come to miami beach and hang out but
first of all they are not renting it to the kids any more you got to have an adult that would rent the place
and we are talking about almost two hundred dollars a night minimum to find anywhere which before for fifty something dollars you can rent out at the beach spend the weekend
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah
yeah
grabando a la gente cuando te hacen algo
hey here you go
pero mira before you used to go to the classes in the university
and you used to be able to record classes
i guess not
maybe the teachers are not
they are teaching so properly that they are afraid that they might be recorded or might say something that they shouldn't say and they could
you know banish them
yeah
pero this country has gotten
just like the lady that that chocó a myriam because ella fue la que lo la chocó you know
the lady is already her back hurts this and that everything hurts and i'm like
the one who should be hurting is my kid
no que le dieron por la ventana por la puerta le desbarató la puerta
el axle de la de la goma de adelante se la partió con eso yo te digo el golpe tan grande que le dio esa mujer
she's just got one of these nineteen ninety five toyotas that are like
remember those toyotas were really heavy
and the and the bumper used to be a different color that they used to
no no it was a car
thank god
imagine if you for a little p t cruiser
la hubiera matado
porque yo no tenía airbags en el p t cruiser
yes but what happened was my my husband being such a small person wanted to buy her a car a used car didn't want her to have a new car like i told him
get the kid a good car when we ended up finding out when we had already paid everything for the car that car had been chocado de adelante completamente
fíjate que tiene el sticker
pero parece que it wasn't in the system yet because it had just happened
so they fixed the car
and they sold it to us thinking that que no nada nada tenía el carro
when we went to trade in the car for the honda the guy told me that he couldn't take that car
and we say why can't you take this car
because that car is no good
it's been crashed from the front
and they put a special sticker when you open up the door of the car on the side right there
they put a sticker when a a a car has been crashed from the front
because of
yes
and they wouldn't they wouldn't take the car for nothing
no ni lo querían
they said no we don't want this
this is the liability for us
you try to sell it the best way you can
and i told let's sue the guy who sold you the car
no no no no i don't wanna worry
you know i don't wanna deal with that
oh ok
but thank god
hello

que que number seven is a i don't know i g t whatever
she'll answer faster to a text message than to answer her phone
i'm serious
you know i wish that that would be a solution to the problem
you know taking away
you know the the the
my philosophy is totally different that
i believe in you know look for something that she's doing right
and reward her
some how
you have to find a way to to either overlook it
and then reframe the whole circumstances
tienes que buscarle la onda porque es que toda la gente en psicología sabe que que eso no trabaja
taking away taking away taking away
that's not good
yeah that that to me that kind of punishment is like when you have finished all your recourses
to reframe the circumstances
you've gotta find ways that she would wanna do it voluntarily to behave
to to get her clothing out
er finding ways
i think that she will be
try it try it
try it
i mean some times you have to use that kind of um
you know training yeah
a a lo mejor trabajo contigo
pero yo trato yo trato lo máximo de no usar esa técnica
no
well many times i give him the silent treatment
bueno no i give him the silent treatment
and he he never gets the silent treatment porque se porta bien
no
instantáneamente ya él sabe que yo estoy disgustada
y and he'll ask me
are you mad at me
i say
yeah i am
what do you expect
you want me to have a smile on my face
but we have a very good communication thank god
and he knows that i'll you know do whatever i can to support him
i say you know
is that necessary
i say
is that necessary
we we in this household believe in respect
and we try to work it out
hablando se entiende la gente
pero hasta ahora because él nada más tiene que quince añitos va para dieciséis next month
a hundred and twenty god willing
thank you
and you know they go through some kind of osmosis when they hit sixteen
sixteen seventeen
so you know he said to me the other day
oh you know mother
you're the greatest
yeah
yeah
él siempre me da cumplidos así
so i said to him
talk to me in two more years
well because they go through this osmosis
then hey what what happened to the to most kids
no i'm praying that it won't happen to my kid
i mean
my oldest son went through a a little bit once he got to the point que estaba dating
and a that seems to be a problem
yeah
no no he was a he went to europe
yeah he used to have some friends
yeah
but the the point to be made is thank god que era serio
y con todo y eso he was problematic
staying up late sixteen seventeen
and he went to religious school
well i would say you know comes nine o'clock nine thirty because she is only eleven
so nine thirty is the latest
the phone gets shut off
the lights go off
the tv goes off
and everybody goes into the sac
it's time to go to sleep
i think that if you program kids like that early in life like my son right now
he automatically can he can't stay up
está cansado
for example now que he's into football
everyday they do training at six in the morning
yeah
it's the first one in the nation
from a religious school
he's thrilled
and
i don't know yet
but he's the guy that's supposed to stop them from moving
yeah i don't know
he said first lineman
i think he told me first lineman
he says
mommy you would be so proud of me
i said
i'm proud of you know
because of course i don't what him to play
but you know what
i don't wanna stifle him
que la vida hay que hacer de todo un poco
yo nunca aprendí a nadar ni roller skate
ni ni ni ni no hice muchas cosas en mi vida because
swimming oh my god that's a perfect
yeah that's the perfect thing to do when you get older
and you know
yeah but yeah
i know but i'm saying
she has to learn
tiene que aprender
she can come with me any time
pero you know she likes
last year we had a great time
we
it's a conflict
yeah
yo te voy a decir una cosa las amigas
por eso ella se puso brava conmigo
porque la amiguita esta que yo vi que estaba con el muchacho ahí
what a stressful situation for that guy
he's in elementary school
and the girl is making advances towards him
you know what is the guy supposed to do
qué podía hacer el pobre
estaba tranquilo
ella cogió la mano del muchachito
se la puso en la en la pierna de ella
la dejó ahí
pobrecito what was he supposed
it's a it's a lot of stress for boys because these girls they don't know how to behave
bueno
no no yo tampoco
pero
pero eso nada yo te digo la verdad
yo estaba sorprendida
yeah
oh thank god
well you start early anyway
yeah
thank god this is a blessing because people that are mothers
you can't you've gotta be on the top of these kids
well you you see how good she is with the computer man
yeah we have we have research but not enough
she brought me a book
me trajo un libro que ella lo había leído when she was in third grade i think
no ella lo quiere así grande
no ella no quiere
ella dice que la maestra lo hizo así
and i said
fine
i say
you know what
the instructions no sirven because te dicen que lo pongas arriba y la maestra dijo que lo ponga abajo
what kind of instructions are that
oh my god
praise god yeah
yeah we'll work on it
she's very good
yeah we know what we're gonna do
i don't know
but you know what they do is for the parents to do their work
you know how many projects ella hizo
tantos proyectos que ha hecho
what kind of a feedback did you get
what kind of a feedback
er in april the first day that you they get back from their vacation
this is due
it's probably in may
may
no we wanna finish it because i'm going on vacation
yeah
yeah
we have the whole week to do that
yeah
no she's good
ella es buena
you know these are
it's supposed to be fun
pero you know what the way they do it
i don't know if they are gonna remember any of this stuff down the line
maybe they will
maybe these things are good
yeah
yeah
we can work at it
ahora yo no sé me gustaría que ella aprendiera a nadar
you know i i'm gonna see maybe maybe
if armand finds a job i need him to get to work
yeah
anything i'm gonna put him in publix anywhere
because last year he worked with nancy
but this year i don't know
no
oh
yeah
no hay dinero en ninguna parte
y el stress level oye
ya
well because of the allergies no me gustaría
tú sabes dust mites he's very allergic
i don't know
i said publix
yeah you know anybody there
yeah good
well i applied last year
pero it was very late
and they already had hired todo el mundo que ellos necesitaban
so
yeah
they make you go
and fill out this application
i i could drop him off
pick up carmencita
pick up armand
drop off carmencita
no conflict of interest
nine
nine to four
it's a whole day
nine to five
yeah
yeah he's sixteen
he'll be sixteen april thirtieth
yeah i like it
and you know the supervision there probably is better than other places
vamos a ver
no
está bueno
whatever
i don't care
i don't want him to be a stock boy
but usually they have er women doing cashier
i've never seen a guy there
the bag boys
yeah the bag boys are guys
and they they're really handicapped the ones that are bag boys
he's good in math
but will he be bored with that
i don't know
oh he would like that
but you can't work in there until you are eighteen
yeah laughing
only why
i tell you why
sí
así a mí no me gustan
i didn't think about the machines
not even in the baking section
no se puede hacer
porque él sabe hacerlo
y él tiene todas las herramientas
no que they have their own anyways so
oh they were outstanding
i ate them all
and then mother goes
oh there's some more left
and then i go
no ya yo me lo comí
y entonces me lo me lo comí todo un día siguiente al otro
y cuando carmencita fue dice
nada yo te todo
see i love sweets
that's my problem sister
no i can take it or leave it
no me no me hace nada anyway
lo que sí hace es ponerte gorda
and i don't need that
i know
and i was reading you know que sugar is bad even for cancer because the cancer cells
yeah they feed on sugar
so that's not good
es mejor
really
i i had an article that someone sent me en en el internet
sí ahí decía todo de eso
sabes quién lo tiene marcelo
she does
yeah
she called me the other day
yeah happy go lucky
tú sabes you know no tengo tiempo para eso
su mamita
pero es que a mí no me gusta heights anyway
ok
maybe
yeah with with carmencita i can go
i'll take her to the pool
i know how to teach
pero yo no sé nadar bien
pero ahí ahí no pasa nada anyway
i mean i take her to the parties
but then she feels like she's left out
i i hope
i know sis
but i don't know what to tell you porque ella no no se quiere mojar la cara
y no sé como va a aprender
no you know what happened at the ocean the other day
that when we went to the park all the kids decided they wanted to go into the ocean
and of course carmencita no fue
fue pero no se metió en el agua
and all the kids got sting stung by a
yeah
todos
llorando y gritando
y yo estaba feliz que mi hija no había entrado
no estaba feliz pues they got hurt
y no llamé a las madres para que
i think was urinating orinando
pero pero todos los niños llorando porque dicen que le dolía mucho
y carmencita tú sabes
pero esto tampoco no le ayuda a carmencita porque le da miedo entrar al agua porque ella tú sabes que le da miedo de todo
so if she would have got stung that would have been her first experience laugh
she wouldn't have been going back in the ocean
i'll tell you that much
no
there was no flag
this is by
no no tenían
nothing
no that's terrible
so
it's very scary
porque yo le tengo mucho respeto al agua
really well you know what
now that luis is is behaving we should go back on the ocean because i don't think it's gonna be wild
i hate it too
but you know he loves his boating
and then his kids have been using it
every weekend los niños de él
no i know
on land
i'll go to the movies while you are on the ocean
i'm safe territory
a él le encanta su bote
ah pero no últimamente no está yendo nada
a los niños
they took over his boat
in a way i'm i'm happy
no
really
and
he does
do you know luis is a is is is knows how to fly
he has his license and everything
but i told him
don't go get your
you don't have to renew it
you have to renew it
yo le dije
don't renew anything
porque yo no me voy airplane with him
oh yeah
is that
paul you met my sister right
paul in the refrigerator sweetheart there's a thing called an empanada
i bought i bought it yesterday
you weren't here
have one
you are gonna love it
i bought it at a colombian restaurant
that's where we are gonna go to lunch today
un restaurante más rico
it's colombian and their empanadas
yeah
but you cook too sis
see i don't
i don't because
although for luis like this week i made him some filet mignon
i made him some fillet mignon week
yeah and then i made him a salad
and carmencita of course estaba comiendo su macaroni and cheese
bueno está comiendo pizza which is a cheese and a a little bit of the sauce
i know
the french fries está comiendo los chicken nuggets
she likes those
yeah
she's eating more salads though
yeah
she's eating chicken caesar salad now
so i need to today
i don't want to go to publix and buy her some more chicken caesar
she loves it
you know the ones that come bagged
a ella le encanta comer eso
but what's in the pasta cheese
y cuánto tú le sirves a todo el mundo
i thought that you meant that you had helping you
do they ever wash the dishes
because yesterday luis luis was washing the dishes yesterday
i was impressed
because you know he would never wash dishes before
yeah
right
no
no no no no
well the guys should help
no that's not good
not good
exactly
do you love kickboxing
i need to start on my treadmill también
ahora que luis luis ha estado ahora
tú sabes que va a coger otra vez el gas station
he got rid of the one in
and he's gonna take one two weeks
but this time he's gonna have an associate because it's it's very expensive
his cousin
yeah
so he'll be back at it
yeah he's good at it
no he knows
and people actually look for him to ask him his opinion
he's like a consultant
and i said you should charge
instead of giving free opinion
yeah
gente cobra
yes he does
yeah he is a very serious guy
now he is more serious laughing
no he is really serious
but yesterday we were watching t v
was on he says
did you know anything about publix
and i said what
and then i told him i needed some ajax soap
and he went
and he got it for me
did you rent it or you didn't
people tell me
oh sí ya voy para allá señora
y me dejan esperando two three four hours
y no vienen
it's terrible
tampoco está alquilado
yeah
fifteen hundred and it's beautiful inside
dos cuartos
dónde tenía adrian su apartamento
lo que pasa es que están arreglando
el edificio afuera le están poniendo todo nuevo pero no han llegado to my unit
so you know
i mean the only thing that you can really use es el balcón
yeah the whole thing
i mean it's astronomical lo que están cobrando
for the maintenance alone i'm paying close to a thousand dollars
it's not worth it
listen if you wanna go see it it's a beautiful place sis
nadie te molesta
está todo nuevecito adentro
pero los baños no son tan modernos como el que tú tienes aquí en en el condo
yeah i know
it is for closure
so many people are in for closure
i don't know how many millions of rooms are gonna be in for closures
sí
listen if you wanna move in there i'll give it to you cheaper
no pero de todos modos no vale la pena
yo te digo sinceramente
i think that you both should come and see it
es lindo
in fact luis se iba a mudar ahí
iba a vender su casa
y se iba a mudar ahí
sí se iba a mudar ahí porque es bonito
that house is beautiful
he should laugh
pero a él
pero a él le gusta trabajar
he wanted to be this
sixty three i think
i think that at sixty five you can retire with a better income
well this is what this is what he told me
if things would get rough where he is working now
he would give them their working papers
and he would retire
right now you know what
a él le gusta la gente que le trabajan
they look up to him
él se siente contento ahí aunque tiene mucho trabajo
they respect him
and you know what
when you retire many times you vegetate
you are throwing the towel
that's what i don't wanna do
i'm i'm getting this adventure now yeah
well i have this invention going that hopefully they will bite
and if they bite you know i will have an income there
a steady income yeah thank god
no i don't wanna do that
i just want to sell my ideas
déjalos que ellos se maten haciendo lo que yo quiero hacer
hacer el producto
este market it
sell it
manufacture it
just royalties
if they like my ideas
yo le dije al tipo yo le dije
you know what the it's needed
it's something that is needed so how could you fail
people will buy it
it's not something that er
yeah
sí
i know it's gonna sell
now let's see if the guy bites
he wrote to me
no this is the second one i'm approaching
he's a a a big supplier to big big stores
he manufactures all kinds of stuff
so
i don't know i'm waiting for his response a ver qué me dice
tú qué crees
yo creo que le va a encantar because
i i'm banking on that sis
i really am banking on that because i like to see you know something that i do
to flourish
and that everybody will benefit from it
yeah
yeah the insurance
oh yeah man
no se puede
no se puede estar sin seguro
no you can't retire
and mm i don't want him to retire either
you'll drive me crazy
yeah he'll drive me nuts
you know
but he's a good guy
yeah
right
they are quiet men
that's a blessing
just for that keep him around laughing
no
yeah
yeah
como no molestas
sería
sí
yo te digo la verdad
sí
él es buena gente
yo siempre te lo he dicho
he is a nice guy
yeah you gave me the letter yeah
and er ya se la dimos al profesor y todo
oh really
you know i think this is so ridiculous
oh please
that's all
oh please
tú sabes cómo están las cosas ahí afuera con los nenes
yo no voy a dejar que please
no
por supuesto que no
i don't like this looseness
yo te digo it's very hard
yeah
no yo lo que hoy digo es que sí
yo i pick up
yeah
well whatever
the thing is
we can calculate to see because cuando uno come afuera it's expensive
yeah
or we could make it less than what we spend
and then we make adjustments
i think that way is better
yeah
right
we put it on a yeah in a list
and then do that way
that will work
pero let let's let's see if she wants to do that
y ayer también
no she brought it up
no es que mami prefiere que ella vaya al parque
pero mami prefiere
yeah
yeah
mañana qué es
sábado
oh en viernes
oh yeah that'll be good
excellent
it's a lot of work
but we can we can
we can
i don't like that
i'd say let let's finish this quickly and maybe we can lift it
now that's how i would work it
you see what i'm talking about
yeah
that that's that's turning it around
you know
right
you know no
exactly
no eso no
pero that's how i i i was saying originally when we started this conversation yo te dije que i don't believe in punishment like that
i mean she deserved she deserved
but she deserves it she deserves it
she has a big mouth
sí
bueno
pero es que a veces hay que hacerlo
ya el el máximo
ya ella se hizo el máximo
no puede estar hablando así boberías
no
yeah
that's what i said at the beginning
te acuerdas que te dije
going yeah
esa es otra cosa que le va a molestar toda el week
really
oh my god
well ese the good thing es que she is a kid
ok good
i'll say
you know what
i'll go outside
pero the last time she was so good
she was so good when they were pulling out that tooth
or they were filling it they were filling it
now she's by herself
i said
mamita te aguanto la mano mamita
no i'm ok
i said

we got the payment on the credit card
pero
yes yeah it's it's mailed out
and then citizens sent me that fax thing that they sent

pero le tengo que mandar la foto
and that's the message that i left her

later on me dejas el bebito dos o tres días en casa

entonces cuando vayas a correr para adelgazarte ponle el bebito

no puedo yo no me puedo quedar sola con el bebito mamita
qué descaradita es
tenías que haberle pedido el permiso
lo que pasa es que no te peleó porque estás embarazada laugh

eso es muy ventajoso hacerlo hoy en día la verdad
lo que es super caro
es muy caro
los primos y todo
