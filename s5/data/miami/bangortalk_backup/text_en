LEA-herring13-0641	o k
LEA-herring13-0644	o k
VAN-herring13-0645	but i have to figure out what it is
LEA-herring13-0646	because i wasn't sure

VAN-herring13-0667	right
LEA-herring13-0668	why

FEL-zeledon3-0015	no i'm not
ELE-zeledon3-0016	yeah you are
FEL-zeledon3-0017	i just have a habit of not putting things where they go
ELE-zeledon3-0024	well i have to train them
ELE-zeledon3-0025	so
FEL-zeledon3-0026	you have to train them
ELE-zeledon3-0027	yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0028	so
ELE-zeledon3-0031	and we have to see if they get good at it
ELE-zeledon3-0032	they're actually trying to like succeed in the job
ELE-zeledon3-0037	so yeah
FEL-zeledon3-0038	well there should be a lot of people that wanna work in to go
ELE-zeledon3-0039	huh
FEL-zeledon3-0040	well there should be a lot of people that need work
ELE-zeledon3-0041	well i don't know
ELE-zeledon3-0042	they haven't hired anybody yet
ELE-zeledon3-0043	so i'm just waiting
FEL-zeledon3-0044	how old do you have to be to work there
FEL-zeledon3-0045	can't alberto work there
FEL-zeledon3-0046	he's sixteen
ELE-zeledon3-0047	no you have to be eighteen to work in chili'seng
FEL-zeledon3-0048	that sucks
ELE-zeledon3-0049	yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0050	no it doesn't
ELE-zeledon3-0051	because if you do it with kids you have to work around their school hours
FEL-zeledon3-0052	yeah but like over the summer like a summer job
ELE-zeledon3-0053	and
ELE-zeledon3-0054	maybe
ELE-zeledon3-0055	well yeah maybe we get people in the summer
ELE-zeledon3-0056	but for now we don't have anybody
ELE-zeledon3-0057	and they don't hire under sixteen
ELE-zeledon3-0058	and if they were to hire
FEL-zeledon3-0059	under what eighteen or sixteen
ELE-zeledon3-0060	uh under eighteen
ELE-zeledon3-0061	but if they hired someone like sixteen they can only work certain amount of hours
ELE-zeledon3-0062	and they can't work before six
ELE-zeledon3-0063	they can't work after eleven
ELE-zeledon3-0064	so i don't know if they're gonna hire younger kids in the summer
ELE-zeledon3-0065	but i think they're not supposed to
ELE-zeledon3-0066	i think the law says that we're not supposed to
FEL-zeledon3-0067	then how come publix hires
ELE-zeledon3-0068	well because
FEL-zeledon3-0069	you only have to be fourteen to work at publix
ELE-zeledon3-0070	i know but the only job they give you is to bag groceries which is not hard
ELE-zeledon3-0071	so i think
FEL-zeledon3-0072	yeah you have to know where to put the eggs and then the all the bread and that kind of stuff
ELE-zeledon3-0073	yeah but that's not hard
FEL-zeledon3-0074	i think it must be hard
ELE-zeledon3-0075	no it's not
FEL-zeledon3-0077	which is
ELE-zeledon3-0078	a meeting where trainers go
ELE-zeledon3-0079	and we talk about progress
ELE-zeledon3-0080	and
FEL-zeledon3-0081	that must suck
ELE-zeledon3-0082	no it doesn't
ELE-zeledon3-0084	the first time we went to we went to like dave and busters i think
ELE-zeledon3-0085	and then the second time
FEL-zeledon3-0086	lucky
ELE-zeledon3-0087	we went to maggianos
FEL-zeledon3-0088	what happened to discussing progress
ELE-zeledon3-0089	we did
ELE-zeledon3-0090	and then they gave us food
ELE-zeledon3-0091	and now we're going to dave and busters again
FEL-zeledon3-0092	lucky
ELE-zeledon3-0093	yeah on thursday
FEL-zeledon3-0094	but how many people are trainers
ELE-zeledon3-0095	a lot
ELE-zeledon3-0096	like twenty
ELE-zeledon3-0098	there's
ELE-zeledon3-0100	there's like in to goseng there's only two
ELE-zeledon3-0101	but i think that i'm the only one that's going
ELE-zeledon3-0102	and servers there's like ten servers
ELE-zeledon3-0103	ten about ten servers that are
FEL-zeledon3-0104	and what do trainers do
ELE-zeledon3-0105	trainers
ELE-zeledon3-0106	train
ELE-zeledon3-0107	show other people how the job works
FEL-zeledon3-0108	then why'd you put you as a trainer
ELE-zeledon3-0109	very funny
FEL-zeledon3-0110	yeah i know you're good at that
FEL-zeledon3-0111	but uh what i'm saying is that why'd they pick you out of everyone that there is
ELE-zeledon3-0112	because they see that i'm the one that has that knows how to do it
ELE-zeledon3-0113	that knows the job better than others
ELE-zeledon3-0114	that can explain it to others
FEL-zeledon3-0115	ok
FEL-zeledon3-0116	uh that's the thing that gets you the discount that trainer card thing on the back that says discount
ELE-zeledon3-0117	yeah
FEL-zeledon3-0118	oh cool
ELE-zeledon3-0119	so that's an advantage
ELE-zeledon3-0121	it's good to be a trainer
ELE-zeledon3-0122	because you help you're helping your workplace by showing new people
ELE-zeledon3-0123	get it
ELE-zeledon3-0124	that's the whole point
FEL-zeledon3-0125	yeah

ELE-zeledon3-0161	that's the easy part
FEL-zeledon3-0162	division
ELE-zeledon3-0163	it's like the problems
ELE-zeledon3-0165	you know like the ones where it says if this this object has a height of this and it has a uh width of this so what is the area or something like that
FEL-zeledon3-0166	that's not that hard

FEL-zeledon3-0194	next year
ELE-zeledon3-0195	if i

ELE-zeledon3-0217	funny
ELE-zeledon3-0218	oh
FEL-zeledon3-0219	mm
ELE-zeledon3-0220	yeah so is there any movie you wanna see that's coming up
FEL-zeledon3-0221	um mm
ELE-zeledon3-0222	no
FEL-zeledon3-0223	thinking thinking thinking
FEL-zeledon3-0224	meet the spartans
FEL-zeledon3-0225	but you don't want to see that
ELE-zeledon3-0226	no
FEL-zeledon3-0227	that movies looks hilarious
FEL-zeledon3-0228	well i do too
ELE-zeledon3-0229	it wasn't in theatres when i went the other day
FEL-zeledon3-0230	really
ELE-zeledon3-0231	i didn't see it
FEL-zeledon3-0232	no they probably already took it out
ELE-zeledon3-0233	yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0234	i wanna see one that's called stop loss
FEL-zeledon3-0235	which is about what
ELE-zeledon3-0236	it's a movie about these um guys that are in the that are in the army
ELE-zeledon3-0237	and so they were in iraq for i dunno i guess couple years or months or something
ELE-zeledon3-0238	and then they come back to texas
ELE-zeledon3-0239	because that's where they're from i guess
ELE-zeledon3-0240	and so they're ready to get out of the army
ELE-zeledon3-0241	and because they did their duty and everything
ELE-zeledon3-0242	and then the army says that they're going back
ELE-zeledon3-0243	because they don't
FEL-zeledon3-0244	oh yeah i've heard about that one
ELE-zeledon3-0245	yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0246	they don't have enough people to fight the war over there
ELE-zeledon3-0247	so they're sending them back
ELE-zeledon3-0248	so that's what i think stop loss means
FEL-zeledon3-0249	that's dumb
ELE-zeledon3-0250	and so like it's a battle deciding if they're going to do it or not
ELE-zeledon3-0251	and it looks pretty cool
ELE-zeledon3-0252	plus it has cute guys in it
FEL-zeledon3-0253	yes
ELE-zeledon3-0254	so yeah
FEL-zeledon3-0255	since i love going to movies with cute guys
ELE-zeledon3-0256	that's a plus
ELE-zeledon3-0257	so we'll see if hmm yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0258	we'll see if i go see that movie
ELE-zeledon3-0259	if we go see that movie because it looks cool
FEL-zeledon3-0260	yeah when i get ungrounded in two months
ELE-zeledon3-0261	ok maybe not with you
ELE-zeledon3-0263	but maybe i'll go see it or something
ELE-zeledon3-0267	nothing new here
ELE-zeledon3-0268	i applied for a credit card
FEL-zeledon3-0269	what
ELE-zeledon3-0270	i applied for a credit card
FEL-zeledon3-0271	don't you already have like
ELE-zeledon3-0272	no credit cards
FEL-zeledon3-0273	what's the difference
ELE-zeledon3-0274	debit card is like they pay it out of your they take the money out of your bank account
FEL-zeledon3-0275	yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0276	and credit is that ah you have to pay for everything
ELE-zeledon3-0277	you get a bill of the things you paid with your credit card
ELE-zeledon3-0278	and then you have to pay them off
ELE-zeledon3-0279	so
FEL-zeledon3-0280	why isn't debit better
FEL-zeledon3-0281	you don't have to worry about bills
ELE-zeledon3-0282	well
FEL-zeledon3-0283	you just have to worry about losing all your money
ELE-zeledon3-0284	well it really depends
ELE-zeledon3-0285	like i think it depends on what you're paying
ELE-zeledon3-0286	because if it's a large sum and they take it out of your bank account and then you have other stuff to pay then you're gonna be short in money
ELE-zeledon3-0287	so if you do credit card they give you a certain time for you to pay them off
ELE-zeledon3-0288	so you don't have to you know pay them on the spot
FEL-zeledon3-0289	oh
ELE-zeledon3-0290	so yeah
FEL-zeledon3-0293	what about him
FEL-zeledon3-0295	yeah sometimes
ELE-zeledon3-0296	but he doesn't hang out with you guys
FEL-zeledon3-0297	yeah sometimes
FEL-zeledon3-0298	but he gets annoying

FEL-zeledon3-0304	yeah he's fine
FEL-zeledon3-0305	yeah well friends with sam
ELE-zeledon3-0306	who's gonna be who's gonna be your best friend when sam leaves
FEL-zeledon3-0307	i don't know
FEL-zeledon3-0308	well i don't know because um adrian gets annoying

FEL-zeledon3-0320	i don't know
FEL-zeledon3-0321	we'll see
FEL-zeledon3-0324	in the same building it's middle
FEL-zeledon3-0325	but like right next to us is the elementary
FEL-zeledon3-0326	and then there's like a preschool there
FEL-zeledon3-0327	and then the high school is all the way near
FEL-zeledon3-0328	not not wait
FEL-zeledon3-0329	somewhere near the library
FEL-zeledon3-0330	wherever that is
ELE-zeledon3-0331	so
ELE-zeledon3-0332	oh it's over there by the library
FEL-zeledon3-0333	yeah the one next to f i u and the library
FEL-zeledon3-0335	twelfth
FEL-zeledon3-0337	eighth
FEL-zeledon3-0339	yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0340	hmm
FEL-zeledon3-0341	yeah but it'll be the same people
FEL-zeledon3-0342	the only difference is that for elementary for elementary there are three different campuses the west campus east campus and f s u campus
FEL-zeledon3-0343	east campus moves to central campus
FEL-zeledon3-0344	middle at west
FEL-zeledon3-0345	and f s u go together and move to west campus middle right
FEL-zeledon3-0346	and then west
ELE-zeledon3-0347	which is where you are
FEL-zeledon3-0348	yeah
FEL-zeledon3-0349	west campus middle and the east and east campus and no and central campus middle move together to
FEL-zeledon3-0350	what's it called
FEL-zeledon3-0351	the only high the big high the high the big high school
FEL-zeledon3-0352	right
FEL-zeledon3-0354	but like i'll still be with the same people
FEL-zeledon3-0355	it's just like each time we keep adding more and more
ELE-zeledon3-0356	so um what classes do you think you're gonna take next year
FEL-zeledon3-0357	next year i'm taking algebra for math which is a ninth grade class
FEL-zeledon3-0358	um i'm taking let's see for language arts what am i taking
FEL-zeledon3-0359	i think i'm i'm taking advanced language arts which is eighth grade class because advanced is a year advanced at my school
FEL-zeledon3-0360	um i'm taking advanced science probably
FEL-zeledon3-0361	um i'm not i don't have to take reading
FEL-zeledon3-0362	because if i get a four or a five on the f cat um i don't have to take reading
FEL-zeledon3-0363	because in seventh grade in eighth grade i mean you don't have to take reading right
FEL-zeledon3-0364	and right there right here um right now i'm taking seventh grade reading
FEL-zeledon3-0365	so and next be taking eighth grade right

ELE-zeledon3-0489	but i don't always do q a
ELE-zeledon3-0490	i asked yesterday
ELE-zeledon3-0491	i went in at four
ELE-zeledon3-0492	but i had to work at six
ELE-zeledon3-0493	so i didn't know
ELE-zeledon3-0494	i thought it was at four o'clock
ELE-zeledon3-0495	so i was two hours early
ELE-zeledon3-0496	so i was like
FEL-zeledon3-0497	you're always like five minutes late
FEL-zeledon3-0498	and and you and you go like two hours early
ELE-zeledon3-0499	well i didn't know
ELE-zeledon3-0500	i didn't know it was uh until six
FEL-zeledon3-0501	how about checking the schedule
ELE-zeledon3-0502	so yesterday i um did a starbucks run
ELE-zeledon3-0503	i went to go get coffee for everybody
ELE-zeledon3-0504	and then when i came back i started helping out one of the managers
ELE-zeledon3-0505	and i was doing prep work which is like you know making the sauces and cooking the meat and cutting it up into pieces and stuff like that
FEL-zeledon3-0506	isn't that what the what the chef's do
FEL-zeledon3-0507	the cutting the
ELE-zeledon3-0508	yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0509	but managers do that too
ELE-zeledon3-0510	so i started helping him
ELE-zeledon3-0511	and then i started to ask him questions about how much they get paid and stuff
ELE-zeledon3-0512	and he says they get paid like like a thousand like eleven hundred around there um every two weeks
ELE-zeledon3-0513	so i mean for my age that's not bad
ELE-zeledon3-0514	if i can get a manager position
FEL-zeledon3-0515	yeah but you i don't really think
FEL-zeledon3-0516	where are you gonna get a manager position
ELE-zeledon3-0517	they could start training me
ELE-zeledon3-0518	and then eventually just tell corporate that they're training me
FEL-zeledon3-0519	manager of what
FEL-zeledon3-0520	to go general manager
ELE-zeledon3-0521	well no
ELE-zeledon3-0522	i mean if they really train me as manager i'm probably not gonna stay at that store
ELE-zeledon3-0523	because they're always moving the managers to other to other restaurants
ELE-zeledon3-0524	i mean to other stores of chili's
FEL-zeledon3-0525	other chili's
FEL-zeledon3-0526	other chili's yeah
ELE-zeledon3-0527	they call them stores instead of restaurants
ELE-zeledon3-0528	because they're all restaurants
FEL-zeledon3-0529	that's
ELE-zeledon3-0530	but they're different place
ELE-zeledon3-0531	they're they're located different places
ELE-zeledon3-0532	so they could move me which is not what i really want
ELE-zeledon3-0533	but if they're paying
ELE-zeledon3-0534	ok well if if they're paying i mean for that amount it doesn't sound bad to me
FEL-zeledon3-0535	ok
ELE-zeledon3-0536	so i mine as well take the opportunity if they offer
FEL-zeledon3-0537	yeah but well like probably where would you get moved to
ELE-zeledon3-0538	i don't know
ELE-zeledon3-0539	it's not up to me or them
ELE-zeledon3-0540	it's up to the corporate um place
ELE-zeledon3-0541	so
FEL-zeledon3-0542	what's the corporate place
ELE-zeledon3-0543	it's like where they decide things about chili's like the stuff on the menu like uh
ELE-zeledon3-0544	i don't know
ELE-zeledon3-0545	stuff they wanna change in each store
ELE-zeledon3-0546	stuff like that
ELE-zeledon3-0547	i don't know
ELE-zeledon3-0548	yeah so i don't know
ELE-zeledon3-0549	we'll see
ELE-zeledon3-0550	but or or i might actually quit chili's

ARI-zeledon13-0468	i at the end of the day i think she has a she has some of a heart
ARI-zeledon13-0469	ok because she's done a lot of messed up things like the whole thing with brenda paltro
ARI-zeledon13-0470	that she
AVE-zeledon13-0471	yeah but how how is brenda even talking to her
ARI-zeledon13-0472	yeah that's what i'm saying
ARI-zeledon13-0473	sara realized that she had messed up the next day
ARI-zeledon13-0474	because she was belligerent
ARI-zeledon13-0475	so she realized that she had messed up the next day
ARI-zeledon13-0476	called her up
ARI-zeledon13-0477	and said like
ARI-zeledon13-0478	sorry look
ARI-zeledon13-0479	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0480	i was messed up
ARI-zeledon13-0481	whatever i said things i didn't mean or whatever
ARI-zeledon13-0482	and once you talk about it it's ok
ARI-zeledon13-0483	like the whole thing with katrina
AVE-zeledon13-0484	yeah but i don't like sara wanted to come to my house
ARI-zeledon13-0485	did you hear what she said about katrina
ARI-zeledon13-0486	did she
ARI-zeledon13-0487	wait
ARI-zeledon13-0488	did you hear what she said to katrina
AVE-zeledon13-0489	no
ARI-zeledon13-0490	ok katrina poked her on facebook
ARI-zeledon13-0491	which was immature
ARI-zeledon13-0492	that's not her business
AVE-zeledon13-0493	why'd she poke her
ARI-zeledon13-0494	because she's stupid
ARI-zeledon13-0495	just because you know to
AVE-zeledon13-0496	to mess around
ARI-zeledon13-0497	yeah to mess around
ARI-zeledon13-0498	it's childish
AVE-zeledon13-0499	whatever
ARI-zeledon13-0500	and um sara wrote her back this nasty message
AVE-zeledon13-0501	like destroyed her life
AVE-zeledon13-0502	no yeah
ARI-zeledon13-0503	this really
ARI-zeledon13-0504	you know sara
ARI-zeledon13-0505	ok when you mess with sara she goes after you your family anybody you've ever been with
AVE-zeledon13-0506	yeah but she's crazy
ARI-zeledon13-0507	and like anybody
ARI-zeledon13-0509	so you know what she told her
AVE-zeledon13-0510	the kids you don't have
ARI-zeledon13-0511	she told her
ARI-zeledon13-0512	she's like flat out
ARI-zeledon13-0513	she's like
ARI-zeledon13-0514	look
ARI-zeledon13-0515	she's like
ARI-zeledon13-0516	i don't care to be your friend
ARI-zeledon13-0517	i don't know why you know what i mean you consider you know what i mean you try messing with me
ARI-zeledon13-0518	and when i talked to her after she told me that a lot of it had to do with the reason why she was so angry is because when you guys were in a fight katrina got involved
ARI-zeledon13-0519	did she ever get involved
AVE-zeledon13-0520	i don't remember
ARI-zeledon13-0521	something that katrina got involved with you with a like a situation between you guys
ARI-zeledon13-0522	and then you know what she writes at the end of the message
ARI-zeledon13-0523	she goes
ARI-zeledon13-0524	i hope that your father is looking down on you
AVE-zeledon13-0525	sara
ARI-zeledon13-0526	like because her dad's dead
ARI-zeledon13-0527	and yeah
ARI-zeledon13-0528	and then like whatever
ARI-zeledon13-0529	like everybody was outraged that she had said such a thing
AVE-zeledon13-0531	i didn't know katrina'seng dad died
AVE-zeledon13-0532	when did he die
ARI-zeledon13-0533	oh like a long time ago
ARI-zeledon13-0534	when we were younger
AVE-zeledon13-0535	but katrina'seng mom remarried no
ARI-zeledon13-0536	no
ARI-zeledon13-0537	i don't think so
ARI-zeledon13-0538	i don't know katrina'seng life
AVE-zeledon13-0539	oh my god i don't know it
ARI-zeledon13-0540	and then um
AVE-zeledon13-0541	i didn't know katrina'seng dad died
ARI-zeledon13-0542	and then she talked about that
ARI-zeledon13-0543	so all this stuff
ARI-zeledon13-0544	and then everybody was like
ARI-zeledon13-0545	oh what is that
ARI-zeledon13-0546	she has no heart
ARI-zeledon13-0547	all this stuff
ARI-zeledon13-0548	and like when i talked to sara about it
ARI-zeledon13-0549	because i talk to sara about everything flat out like the vacuum cleaner story in the apartment the turning on and off of the chime the comment about lesbians
ARI-zeledon13-0551	like all that stuff i talk to her about
ARI-zeledon13-0552	and she she was telling me that the whole thing with katrina is she felt bad after having said something
ARI-zeledon13-0553	but she knew that if she hadn't said something so powerful katrina would have probably written back to that comment
ARI-zeledon13-0554	and then it woulda just started this whole thing
ARI-zeledon13-0555	she's like
ARI-zeledon13-0556	i wanted to say something to her that she knew i meant business
ARI-zeledon13-0557	and that i want nothing to do with her
ARI-zeledon13-0558	you understand what i mean
AVE-zeledon13-0559	ok
AVE-zeledon13-0560	look
AVE-zeledon13-0561	i need to say something
AVE-zeledon13-0562	so you know what that reminds me of
AVE-zeledon13-0563	like the like elena thing
AVE-zeledon13-0564	when they were like
AVE-zeledon13-0565	i don't think we should be friends
AVE-zeledon13-0566	i think we i think we should take a break
AVE-zeledon13-0567	like how old are we
ARI-zeledon13-0568	we're super we're super immature
AVE-zeledon13-0569	ok like like that whole thing of like
AVE-zeledon13-0570	oh i needed to tell her her dead father

AVE-zeledon13-0576	but like she's like result of her like like family
ARI-zeledon13-0577	she is
AVE-zeledon13-0578	i think for real for real i think sara has like like issues
AVE-zeledon13-0579	because dude i remember like when she was like living with me oh my god the nights that she would cheat on paul
AVE-zeledon13-0580	and then call him crying
AVE-zeledon13-0581	and this whole thing
AVE-zeledon13-0582	she wanted to go see
ARI-zeledon13-0583	oh you know how many times she's cheated on
AVE-zeledon13-0584	but but ok
AVE-zeledon13-0585	but how
AVE-zeledon13-0586	like where in someone's right mind
AVE-zeledon13-0587	but she
AVE-zeledon13-0588	i don't know
AVE-zeledon13-0589	but see like
AVE-zeledon13-0591	but what is that dude
AVE-zeledon13-0592	but what is that
AVE-zeledon13-0593	like today she was texting
AVE-zeledon13-0594	again
AVE-zeledon13-0595	like does she like asking for forgiveness twenty six times like a month
AVE-zeledon13-0596	and like i don't get
AVE-zeledon13-0598	i don't get why you like feel like a like you're caught
AVE-zeledon13-0600	her leaving to tallahassee was like a big deal
AVE-zeledon13-0601	it caused like a lot more problems than she
ARI-zeledon13-0602	oh no here's the thing
ARI-zeledon13-0603	when i found out ok
AVE-zeledon13-0604	and where's she going after her t c c dude
ARI-zeledon13-0605	ok to f s u
AVE-zeledon13-0606	yeah right
AVE-zeledon13-0607	she's getting in
ARI-zeledon13-0608	when i found out that she had left to tallahassee without telling her mom anything and all this stuff
AVE-zeledon13-0609	that's crazy
ARI-zeledon13-0610	and it had just happened that thing with my mom
ARI-zeledon13-0611	so when i went to tallahassee i look at her
ARI-zeledon13-0612	and i'm like
ARI-zeledon13-0613	sara you can't do that
ARI-zeledon13-0614	because at the end of the day that's your mom
ARI-zeledon13-0615	and i guess like something clicked in her head
ARI-zeledon13-0616	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0617	that's the thing
ARI-zeledon13-0618	that's the reason why me and sara
ARI-zeledon13-0619	ana's always like
ARI-zeledon13-0620	i don't understand how you're friends with her
ARI-zeledon13-0621	all this stuff
ARI-zeledon13-0622	the girl's shady
ARI-zeledon13-0623	she's done a whole bunch of shady things
ARI-zeledon13-0624	yeah but the one person that i can talk to
ARI-zeledon13-0625	like obviously i have veronica
ARI-zeledon13-0626	and i have vanessa and stuff
ARI-zeledon13-0627	but like ana and them they judge me all the time
ARI-zeledon13-0628	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0629	maybe not to my face
ARI-zeledon13-0630	but they do
ARI-zeledon13-0631	and vanessa i think to an extent judge me too
ARI-zeledon13-0632	because we're different
ARI-zeledon13-0633	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0635	but me and veronica are very similar
ARI-zeledon13-0636	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0637	yeah hers is just her dad
ARI-zeledon13-0638	and mines is my mom
ARI-zeledon13-0639	so what happens is that sara'seng that type of person that i can go to sara
ARI-zeledon13-0640	and i can tell her anything
ARI-zeledon13-0641	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0642	and i know she's not gonna judge me
ARI-zeledon13-0643	why
ARI-zeledon13-0644	because she's done pretty messed up things in her life
ARI-zeledon13-0645	and she's had a pretty messed up family too
ARI-zeledon13-0646	so it's not
ARI-zeledon13-0647	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0648	it's not like
ARI-zeledon13-0650	she yeah she she's no one to judge me
AVE-zeledon13-0651	yeah yeah yeah
ARI-zeledon13-0652	and on top of everything when i tell her
ARI-zeledon13-0653	i can i can talk to veronia as much as i can
ARI-zeledon13-0654	and try to tell her things about my mom
ARI-zeledon13-0655	but at the end of the day she has a mom who's great
ARI-zeledon13-0656	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0658	who's there for her
ARI-zeledon13-0659	and all that stuff
ARI-zeledon13-0660	so
ARI-zeledon13-0662	yeah
ARI-zeledon13-0663	with veronica it's different
ARI-zeledon13-0664	because at the end of the day i have the dad
ARI-zeledon13-0665	and she doesn't have the dad
ARI-zeledon13-0666	do you understand what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0667	but with sara it's um it's the it's the same issue
ARI-zeledon13-0668	it's the moms
ARI-zeledon13-0669	although her mom maybe more crazy than mine
ARI-zeledon13-0670	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0671	to a certain extent
ARI-zeledon13-0672	because my mom's crazy
ARI-zeledon13-0673	more crazy in a certain point
ARI-zeledon13-0674	and her mom is more crazy
AVE-zeledon13-0675	it's different yeah yeah
ARI-zeledon13-0676	and another point
ARI-zeledon13-0677	so that's why
ARI-zeledon13-0678	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0679	i talk to her
ARI-zeledon13-0680	so when i talked to her about that whole thing i think it kinda clicked in her head
ARI-zeledon13-0681	and her and her mom were good for a
ARI-zeledon13-0682	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-0683	after the tallahassee her mom even took her up
AVE-zeledon13-0684	they don't talk like her and her mom
ARI-zeledon13-0685	and stayed there
ARI-zeledon13-0686	i'm not i'm not sure how their relationship is right now
ARI-zeledon13-0687	when i go see her i think i'm gonna do it
ARI-zeledon13-0689	yeah
ARI-zeledon13-0690	oh after that whole thing with robert
ARI-zeledon13-0691	and that he got arrested because of um violence with
ARI-zeledon13-0692	remember that day we called her
ARI-zeledon13-0693	with the new wife

ARI-zeledon13-1179	here's the thing
ARI-zeledon13-1180	when that when that was issued when that was given to them like that nickname by lucy was given to them then they took it to a whole another level
ARI-zeledon13-1181	here's the thing
ARI-zeledon13-1182	if you get called something and you know it's not true and you think it's so funny that that person even thought about it
AVE-zeledon13-1183	you drop it

ARI-zeledon13-1190	oh i don't know about that
AVE-zeledon13-1191	there's like there's i don't think i don't think that story's like that wrong
ARI-zeledon13-1192	according to her no
AVE-zeledon13-1193	i don't think that maybe she did it
AVE-zeledon13-1194	but i think i think there's something behind that
ARI-zeledon13-1195	i don't know
AVE-zeledon13-1196	dude you can't get that out of nowhere
ARI-zeledon13-1197	i don't know
ARI-zeledon13-1198	i mean whether lucy said it
ARI-zeledon13-1199	lucy said it because
ARI-zeledon13-1200	i mean there was something there
ARI-zeledon13-1201	like that they kissed or whatever whatever
AVE-zeledon13-1202	yeah but their pictures are gross
AVE-zeledon13-1203	have you seen the pictures
ARI-zeledon13-1204	that's what i'm telling you
ARI-zeledon13-1205	the pictures now attribute to the fact that lucy said what she said
ARI-zeledon13-1206	they're just taking the joke to a whole another level
ARI-zeledon13-1207	that's what happened with the whole dyke thing
AVE-zeledon13-1208	i dunno
ARI-zeledon13-1209	and
AVE-zeledon13-1210	but i would almost drop it
ARI-zeledon13-1211	that's what i kept telling sara
ARI-zeledon13-1212	i'm like
ARI-zeledon13-1213	just drop it already
ARI-zeledon13-1214	she's like
AVE-zeledon13-1215	oh she's
ARI-zeledon13-1216	yeah that's what i kept telling her
ARI-zeledon13-1217	but whatever
ARI-zeledon13-1218	oh well the whole cop thing
ARI-zeledon13-1219	she was telling me that
ARI-zeledon13-1220	and you know that sara'seng very
ARI-zeledon13-1221	she was telling me that she feels like breaking face in
ARI-zeledon13-1222	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1223	but the reason why she doesn't do it is because she already has a a a violence on her record
ARI-zeledon13-1224	that's one
AVE-zeledon13-1225	oh my god
ARI-zeledon13-1226	and two
AVE-zeledon13-1227	who is she
ARI-zeledon13-1228	yeah that she already has violence on her record
ARI-zeledon13-1229	and two she doesn't want that you know what i mean any more because the violence from before was from what we were sophomores
ARI-zeledon13-1230	so that's like expunged the minute you you turn eighteen
ARI-zeledon13-1231	you know what i mean
AVE-zeledon13-1233	it's expunged
ARI-zeledon13-1234	yeah it's expunged
ARI-zeledon13-1235	so whatever
ARI-zeledon13-1236	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1237	and like now she says that she wants to go in to in to like the police force and whatever
ARI-zeledon13-1238	and she wants to do it
AVE-zeledon13-1239	to police force
ARI-zeledon13-1240	i think i think you have to you have to
AVE-zeledon13-1241	and don't you have to start off like an explorer or something crazy like that
ARI-zeledon13-1242	you have to you have to major in like i think maybe that maybe maybe like you should major in like law studies
ARI-zeledon13-1243	or something like that
ARI-zeledon13-1244	or like criminal justice
AVE-zeledon13-1245	yeah but isn't t c c only two years
ARI-zeledon13-1246	and then later on you become
ARI-zeledon13-1248	t c c is two years
ARI-zeledon13-1249	it's a community college
ARI-zeledon13-1250	i mean you could be in a community college for four years
ARI-zeledon13-1251	but it's your first sixty credits
ARI-zeledon13-1252	you don't need college
AVE-zeledon13-1253	yeah but where where is she going

ARI-zeledon13-1266	i'm gonna i'll talk to her about it
ARI-zeledon13-1267	see what she wants to do or whatever
AVE-zeledon13-1269	well she coulda done so good here
AVE-zeledon13-1270	the coach was like sara
ARI-zeledon13-1271	oh she coulda been an an excellent runner
AVE-zeledon13-1272	they would have paid for everything
ARI-zeledon13-1273	they coulda had a full
AVE-zeledon13-1274	you don't get it
ARI-zeledon13-1275	right
ARI-zeledon13-1276	but

AVE-zeledon13-1289	if like your scores are low they still help you get in
AVE-zeledon13-1290	but hers weren't like like she needed to improve them
AVE-zeledon13-1291	like there wasn't anything the coach could do whatever
AVE-zeledon13-1292	but he told her
AVE-zeledon13-1293	he's like
AVE-zeledon13-1294	improve them
AVE-zeledon13-1295	i can give you dorm
AVE-zeledon13-1296	i can give you
AVE-zeledon13-1297	you know because if if she filed
ARI-zeledon13-1298	i told her
ARI-zeledon13-1299	you know how many times i told her about
ARI-zeledon13-1301	and at this time her grandparents had custody of her
ARI-zeledon13-1302	which means she woulda had to have put her grandparents' information
ARI-zeledon13-1303	they're two retired people
ARI-zeledon13-1304	ok
ARI-zeledon13-1305	that get paid off of like medicare or whatever

ARI-zeledon13-1307	social security
AVE-zeledon13-1308	that's crazy
ARI-zeledon13-1309	so you know how much money she woulda gotten
ARI-zeledon13-1310	her grandparents must make like what twenty thousand
AVE-zeledon13-1311	bro she threw that all away
AVE-zeledon13-1312	but you know what
ARI-zeledon13-1313	she threw everything away
AVE-zeledon13-1314	when we stopped being friends that's when she left to t c c
ARI-zeledon13-1315	but i i told her
AVE-zeledon13-1316	for real
AVE-zeledon13-1317	when we stopped being friends she was coming with me
AVE-zeledon13-1318	i took her to all the all the coaches that that like every time the coach wanted to eat with her she didn't want him to know that she didn't have a car
AVE-zeledon13-1319	would take her
AVE-zeledon13-1320	you know
AVE-zeledon13-1321	whatever
AVE-zeledon13-1322	i took her to seriously like ten dinners
AVE-zeledon13-1323	maybe like four
AVE-zeledon13-1324	i took her to whatever
AVE-zeledon13-1325	the coach was like super on her
AVE-zeledon13-1326	he called her every day
AVE-zeledon13-1327	all this stuff
AVE-zeledon13-1328	the second we stopped being friends she was like
AVE-zeledon13-1329	oh she thought everything was like this
ARI-zeledon13-1331	cathy got into f s u because of me
ARI-zeledon13-1332	ok
AVE-zeledon13-1333	but doesn't cathy go there for free
ARI-zeledon13-1334	because
ARI-zeledon13-1335	yeah
ARI-zeledon13-1336	listen
ARI-zeledon13-1337	she got she got in for free because of me
AVE-zeledon13-1338	because you told her right about the thing
ARI-zeledon13-1339	the care program
ARI-zeledon13-1340	ok
ARI-zeledon13-1341	because we were sitting in art class
ARI-zeledon13-1342	cathy cathy had no thought of even going to tallahassee
ARI-zeledon13-1343	ok
ARI-zeledon13-1344	and and i was talking to my who was great ok
ARI-zeledon13-1345	who she knew since the minute my sister left that school that that's where i wanted to go
ARI-zeledon13-1347	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1348	miss thomas who was great
ARI-zeledon13-1349	she would call esther everyday
ARI-zeledon13-1350	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1351	and then she told me
ARI-zeledon13-1352	look there's a loophole
ARI-zeledon13-1353	your grades aren't that well
ARI-zeledon13-1354	which mind you i brought up my grades senior year like ridiculous
ARI-zeledon13-1355	i graduated with a three point eight from lourdes
ARI-zeledon13-1356	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1357	why
ARI-zeledon13-1358	because i was just lazy
ARI-zeledon13-1359	if i put my mind to it i can do it
ARI-zeledon13-1361	because i'm not stupid
ARI-zeledon13-1362	i just i'm lazy
ARI-zeledon13-1363	and so what happened was that she she had told me about the care system whatever and all this stuff
ARI-zeledon13-1364	and it was if your parents made under a certain amount of money
ARI-zeledon13-1365	um mine's happened because my mom was divorced
ARI-zeledon13-1366	whatever it was all the money issue
ARI-zeledon13-1367	and you know how like cathy isn't that well off
ARI-zeledon13-1369	and like her parents have they have a business but like
AVE-zeledon13-1370	they have like flimsy jobs yeah yeah
ARI-zeledon13-1371	but like yeah
ARI-zeledon13-1372	but like it's like going down
ARI-zeledon13-1373	and whatever all this stuff
ARI-zeledon13-1374	like lucy was always talking to us about how her parents were helping out with cathy and all that stuff
AVE-zeledon13-1375	yeah yeah yeah
ARI-zeledon13-1376	and i told her about it
ARI-zeledon13-1377	and she's like
ARI-zeledon13-1378	oh ok i'm gonna go ask my counselor
ARI-zeledon13-1379	because her counselor didn't care
ARI-zeledon13-1380	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1381	like if if she didn't get in
ARI-zeledon13-1382	yeah
ARI-zeledon13-1383	she and then so she went to her counselor
ARI-zeledon13-1384	she got that thing
ARI-zeledon13-1385	she wrote the great essay
ARI-zeledon13-1386	all this stuff
ARI-zeledon13-1387	she got in
ARI-zeledon13-1389	yeah but cathy and lucy haven't been friends for a long time
ARI-zeledon13-1390	the thing is is that if when you have a friendship so for such a long time lucy was always the dominant one
ARI-zeledon13-1391	and cathy was always the one that just followed along whatever lucy said
ARI-zeledon13-1392	and so what happened was that that lucy would kind of like not mistreat cathy but she would kinda like take cathy for granted
ARI-zeledon13-1393	you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1394	and like tell her things
ARI-zeledon13-1395	and then and what happened was then cathy became close to esther who is more or less like her
ARI-zeledon13-1396	because esther is a very is a very is a person who follows
ARI-zeledon13-1397	she she you know what i mean
ARI-zeledon13-1398	you tell her what to do and she does it
ARI-zeledon13-1399	so they became friends
ARI-zeledon13-1400	and then when lucy saw that esther and cathy were getting close together she
AVE-zeledon13-1401	well lucy had her phases
ARI-zeledon13-1402	oh she had her phase
ARI-zeledon13-1403	i remember
AVE-zeledon13-1404	lucy had the craziest moments
ARI-zeledon13-1405	oh yeah
ARI-zeledon13-1406	i remember
AVE-zeledon13-1407	do you remember when it was like
AVE-zeledon13-1408	i remember when there was like a point that it was like people are like scared of lucy
AVE-zeledon13-1409	like no one wanted to talk to her
AVE-zeledon13-1410	she was that scary
ARI-zeledon13-1411	when we went on retreat
AVE-zeledon13-1412	because she was that
ARI-zeledon13-1413	when we went on retreat
ARI-zeledon13-1414	first of all she treated mark like crap
ARI-zeledon13-1415	ok because i remember distinctly a game a game
AVE-zeledon13-1416	is she better now
ARI-zeledon13-1417	yeah
ARI-zeledon13-1418	a game here
ARI-zeledon13-1419	i'll tell you right now story
ARI-zeledon13-1421	i remember a story distinctly a game here at at um f i u columbus versus something that she was screaming at mark like if mark was her kid
ARI-zeledon13-1422	screaming at him
ARI-zeledon13-1423	telling him all these things like
ARI-zeledon13-1424	people thought she was crazy
ARI-zeledon13-1426	like all the all
ARI-zeledon13-1427	lucy i mean esther bonnie and tiffany were ready to drop that friendship
ARI-zeledon13-1428	ok
ARI-zeledon13-1429	so the point
ARI-zeledon13-1431	oh
ARI-zeledon13-1432	then we went then we went on encounter

MAR-maria24-0181	beating them up
MAR-maria24-0182	beating them up
MAR-maria24-0183	i know
MAR-maria24-0184	i always
MAR-maria24-0185	those when i go to the zoo i always feel bad for the animals
MAR-maria24-0186	although the zoos are much better than they were when you and i were kids
MAR-maria24-0188	a chlorified cage
MAR-maria24-0189	and that was it
MAR-maria24-0190	that's how the zoos used to be
MAR-maria24-0191	now that this open wide zoos are
MAR-maria24-0192	you know
MAR-maria24-0193	at least they have some semblance of something
MAR-maria24-0194	but i always feel bad for the big mammals
MAR-maria24-0195	for the big gorilla
MAR-maria24-0196	you know
MAR-maria24-0197	the the mount gorilla
MAR-maria24-0198	for the elephants

MAR-maria24-0213	they were converting
MAR-maria24-0214	they were converting

MAR-maria24-0380	but i'm saying this
MAR-maria24-0381	pro ninth

MAR-maria24-0388	who's been doing

MAR-maria24-0392	right
MAR-maria24-0393	i don't know who they are
MAR-maria24-0394	i don't either but i
MAR-maria24-0395	right right
MAR-maria24-0399	and they do public work so it's
MAR-maria24-0408	they're mostly engineers
MAR-maria24-0409	right right right
MAR-maria24-0412	which means we need to be diligent
MAR-maria24-0413	we need to be diligent
MAR-maria24-0415	how did we how did we find out these projects
MAR-maria24-0416	and then there was nothing in
MAR-maria24-0417	right right you would have seen
MAR-maria24-0419	right right right right
MAR-maria24-0420	we wanna know because
MAR-maria24-0421	because otherwise
MAR-maria24-0422	i mean
MAR-maria24-0423	i mean
MAR-maria24-0424	or you can just for the hell of it complain
MAR-maria24-0426	right
MAR-maria24-0427	it would be nice to find out when the presentations are
MAR-maria24-0428	so that
MAR-maria24-0429	you know
MAR-maria24-0430	you or i or hannah or something can go just to to see how other people do things
MAR-maria24-0437	so is very easy to hang out
MAR-maria24-0444	so they have an audience
MAR-maria24-0446	it's a public
MAR-maria24-0461	why not
MAR-maria24-0462	uh
MAR-maria24-0463	but that means that they have to stick what's drawn in the colouring book
MAR-maria24-0464	a blank piece of paper gives them freedom

MAR-maria24-0533	and see wheter we picked the colour

EVE-sastre11-0039	oh yeah yeah it's easy for you

DIE-sastre11-0058	and he's almost done
DIE-sastre11-0059	and then we started to installing the furniture friday
DIE-sastre11-0060	friday they started to deliver it
DIE-sastre11-0061	but friday we had a big day like six people did deliveries
DIE-sastre11-0062	so i was like one after the other
DIE-sastre11-0069	yeah none of the the electronics are in
DIE-sastre11-0070	and we still have to do
DIE-sastre11-0071	we have this guy
DIE-sastre11-0072	i don't know if you've noticed
DIE-sastre11-0073	but there's in my mom's house there's this ceiling
DIE-sastre11-0074	that's all wood
DIE-sastre11-0075	and the guy who made that
DIE-sastre11-0076	he made it from scratch by hand the whole thing
DIE-sastre11-0077	is this brazilian guy that's a woodworker
DIE-sastre11-0078	he and and he's just gifted
DIE-sastre11-0079	that's what he does
EVE-sastre11-0080	yeah
DIE-sastre11-0082	and he does all the stuff
DIE-sastre11-0083	so he's building the closet
DIE-sastre11-0084	and he built
DIE-sastre11-0085	they wanted to charge us like fifteen thousands dollars to do one of these closets that's very modular
DIE-sastre11-0086	and everything's super organized
DIE-sastre11-0088	and he's it's the same
DIE-sastre11-0089	when you gonna see oliver's
EVE-sastre11-0090	ok
DIE-sastre11-0091	oliver's closet
DIE-sastre11-0092	it's awesome
DIE-sastre11-0096	he's a contractor that has done he did my grandmother stuff
DIE-sastre11-0097	he did my mom's stuff
DIE-sastre11-0098	we just use he use we use him on everything because the guy is super responsible you know like we are
DIE-sastre11-0099	and and he does his stuff
DIE-sastre11-0100	and and he knows his stuff
DIE-sastre11-0101	he got us the tile guy because the tile guy was expensive
DIE-sastre11-0104	they came out perfect
DIE-sastre11-0105	they came out perfect
DIE-sastre11-0106	they came up beautiful they came up beautiful
DIE-sastre11-0110	so
DIE-sastre11-0111	they did it in a week
DIE-sastre11-0113	they did it in a week
DIE-sastre11-0114	they did the whole tile in a week
DIE-sastre11-0118	and they just went
DIE-sastre11-0119	and they finished it in a week
DIE-sastre11-0120	i couldn't believe it
DIE-sastre11-0121	they laid the tile perfect
DIE-sastre11-0123	perfect perfect perfect
DIE-sastre11-0124	that it's beautiful
DIE-sastre11-0125	but when when you go to the balcony you see that they really looked at it from end to end and they laid everything so in line
DIE-sastre11-0126	you know really really nice very very clean
DIE-sastre11-0127	you know what i mean
DIE-sastre11-0137	it's awesome
DIE-sastre11-0139	and it's on the twenty seventh floor
DIE-sastre11-0141	so you're like everything's right there
DIE-sastre11-0142	when what we see like if you drew a line straight out it would be the hard rock in bay side
DIE-sastre11-0143	that's like a line straight off from our balcony
DIE-sastre11-0144	because the building is at an angle
DIE-sastre11-0145	so if you say that this is we look like this
DIE-sastre11-0146	ok this is the building
DIE-sastre11-0147	we're on this side
EVE-sastre11-0148	um
DIE-sastre11-0149	so we look like towards
DIE-sastre11-0150	the other side of the building looks like up the
EVE-sastre11-0151	yeah

DIE-sastre11-0153	like up towards north miami beach
DIE-sastre11-0157	it really is
DIE-sastre11-0158	it's very small
DIE-sastre11-0159	it's very small

DIE-sastre11-0164	it has two bedrooms
DIE-sastre11-0165	it has like a library like a den which is our office where we're putting the the sofa bed and we're putting the computers and that stuff
DIE-sastre11-0166	and then it has the living room the kitchen the the two bathrooms and the entry way and the balcony
DIE-sastre11-0167	that's it
DIE-sastre11-0169	yeah
DIE-sastre11-0170	it's not a lot of space
DIE-sastre11-0172	it's about thirty hundred and fifty square feets
DIE-sastre11-0173	so when you think about that that's a lot of space
DIE-sastre11-0177	no and we didn't know oliver was coming when we made the commitment
DIE-sastre11-0179	when we put the deposit we didn't know oliver was coming

DIE-sastre11-0280	they told me
DIE-sastre11-0286	the you know what though
DIE-sastre11-0287	the danger is how much it comes down to
DIE-sastre11-0288	but the fact is if he even comes close to that what you guys have if you guys can get a comp now at that price this neighbourhood is gonna stay great
DIE-sastre11-0289	that's a heck of a selling price
DIE-sastre11-0291	that was a home run
DIE-sastre11-0293	that was a grand slam
DIE-sastre11-0300	that one at bat
DIE-sastre11-0302	and that's how it is
DIE-sastre11-0303	that's how it is
DIE-sastre11-0304	look at that
DIE-sastre11-0305	that's
DIE-sastre11-0310	no no no that's a great feeling
DIE-sastre11-0311	that's a great feeling
DIE-sastre11-0315	no way no
DIE-sastre11-0319	men

DIE-sastre11-0327	she has her days
DIE-sastre11-0328	she has
DIE-sastre11-0329	she's all over the place
DIE-sastre11-0330	you see everything
DIE-sastre11-0331	you see everything
DIE-sastre11-0332	it's like the rainbow
DIE-sastre11-0333	you see everything
DIE-sastre11-0334	she's so amazing though
DIE-sastre11-0336	she's so amazing
DIE-sastre11-0339	if i can do anything in the world right now i would take care of her all the time
DIE-sastre11-0341	that's what i would do
DIE-sastre11-0342	if i had if i had a million dollars
DIE-sastre11-0345	ten more years in my business and i'll be able to step back a lot more
DIE-sastre11-0346	but
DIE-sastre11-0348	yeah
DIE-sastre11-0349	we're at five years
DIE-sastre11-0350	we're at five years
DIE-sastre11-0351	and it's a we did almost two millions dollars in sales last year
DIE-sastre11-0352	and that's of selling labor
DIE-sastre11-0353	of our hours
DIE-sastre11-0354	like we charge a hundred and seventy five an hour more less
DIE-sastre11-0355	and this year we'll probably sell like two and a half millions
EVE-sastre11-0356	wow
DIE-sastre11-0357	yeah it's amazing
DIE-sastre11-0358	we are like at the highest level
DIE-sastre11-0359	of partnership with microsoft
DIE-sastre11-0360	we're microsoft gold manage partners
EVE-sastre11-0361	mm
DIE-sastre11-0362	and they give us a lot of the customers now
DIE-sastre11-0363	and they give us money to do marketing
DIE-sastre11-0364	and they give us money to do events and host things and all sort of stuff
DIE-sastre11-0365	so that's really it
DIE-sastre11-0366	we do a lot of microsoft cisco and two other companies that also are really high in technology
DIE-sastre11-0367	and we do all sorts of customers
DIE-sastre11-0368	we have like thirty car dealerships
DIE-sastre11-0369	we had a lot of real estate customers that have all died
DIE-sastre11-0371	all the developers are almost out of business
DIE-sastre11-0372	we we had seventeen i think we have like two left
DIE-sastre11-0373	yeah
DIE-sastre11-0374	it's incredible
DIE-sastre11-0375	that whole market that whole vertical has just gone
DIE-sastre11-0382	no and and it's not cheap
DIE-sastre11-0383	and and there's not people buying houses and flipping houses and building houses
DIE-sastre11-0384	so even though that it's a great opportunity to make money there it's not there
DIE-sastre11-0385	you're right
DIE-sastre11-0386	it's invisible
DIE-sastre11-0397	you know
DIE-sastre11-0398	and they show you how to penny pinch
DIE-sastre11-0402	yeah you you take you stretch out the cleaning
DIE-sastre11-0403	instead of this and all the stuff
DIE-sastre11-0404	and before you know it you you save three or four hundred dollars a month that if you put into something you are saving money
DIE-sastre11-0406	and saving money is the hardest thing to do
DIE-sastre11-0407	that's the hardest thing to do because there's no extra there is never extra
EVE-sastre11-0418	i'm sorry
DIE-sastre11-0420	the sunday herald today had a big section on how the price of food is going up exponentially
DIE-sastre11-0421	here and around the world because oats and wheat have through the roof
EVE-sastre11-0422	oh yeah
DIE-sastre11-0423	they're
DIE-sastre11-0424	and the other thing that's gone really high is corn because people are now using it to make the gas the ethanol
DIE-sastre11-0425	right
DIE-sastre11-0426	so a lot of people are buying corn so it's creating competition and demand and all these areas that are driving
EVE-sastre11-0427	mm
EVE-sastre11-0429	i know
DIE-sastre11-0430	like every time their cost goes up like like by a dollar on the on the market the cost of our cereal goes up by a penny
EVE-sastre11-0431	yeah
DIE-sastre11-0432	and that'll jump twenty dollars and boom
DIE-sastre11-0433	they have to raise it twenty cents on the cost
DIE-sastre11-0435	the milk
DIE-sastre11-0437	no no no and now everybody is buying organic
DIE-sastre11-0438	so that's like six dollars
DIE-sastre11-0439	they they get you
DIE-sastre11-0463	ah the grid you're contributing power into the grid
DIE-sastre11-0465	all day
DIE-sastre11-0466	and your and your meter is basically rolling backward and you're getting charged credited
DIE-sastre11-0467	and then at night it uses electricity
DIE-sastre11-0469	right
DIE-sastre11-0471	so now farmers are building fields
DIE-sastre11-0479	they look just like that but they're fields of solar panel
DIE-sastre11-0480	and they collect energy all day
DIE-sastre11-0481	right
DIE-sastre11-0482	and they sell that energy back to this grid because the government is the one that has is paying a subsidy
DIE-sastre11-0483	right
DIE-sastre11-0485	for any body
DIE-sastre11-0487	the that wants to do it
DIE-sastre11-0488	and that is saving so much energy energy production that that's less coal less oil less you know natural gas less whatever
DIE-sastre11-0501	no this is crazy
DIE-sastre11-0502	it's crazy yeah
EVE-sastre11-0503	this crazy er
DIE-sastre11-0504	and now you have china and all these other countries that are exploding with growth
EVE-sastre11-0505	yeah
DIE-sastre11-0506	and they're where we were fifty years ago
DIE-sastre11-0507	so they're gonna start expending and burning and using so much
DIE-sastre11-0508	that we have to switch
DIE-sastre11-0509	because if not we're gonna get pulled back for them to move forward
DIE-sastre11-0510	there's interesting things that i've i've read about you know how everything
DIE-sastre11-0511	it's a there's a book called it's a flat world that talks about how the whole world is now because of the way technology and everything is we're all in a little village
DIE-sastre11-0512	and what one person does affects the other one
DIE-sastre11-0514	and everybody's gotta realize we have such direct impact
DIE-sastre11-0515	we're not often little islands any more
DIE-sastre11-0516	it's not like that
DIE-sastre11-0517	even if you're you know ninety miles it's nothing
DIE-sastre11-0518	a hundred miles you know a hundred thousands miles you know
DIE-sastre11-0520	it's a
DIE-sastre11-0534	so i have everybody's information in there
DIE-sastre11-0535	then i have all my email
DIE-sastre11-0536	in my email when you call my cellular phone and you leave a voice mail right it records a computer file that puts that into my email
DIE-sastre11-0537	right and then i listen to all my voice mail on my email
DIE-sastre11-0538	so i sit down once a week or whatever
DIE-sastre11-0539	just grab all my email that are voice mail
DIE-sastre11-0541	and i listen to them
DIE-sastre11-0543	or my faxes
DIE-sastre11-0544	the faxes all come in when you send it you hear the number
DIE-sastre11-0545	it's sounds like a regular fax machine
DIE-sastre11-0547	and puts it in my email
DIE-sastre11-0548	and it's a p d f
DIE-sastre11-0549	and then i can look in the faxes
DIE-sastre11-0550	so everything's right there
DIE-sastre11-0551	everything's in my phone
DIE-sastre11-0552	i can look at the p d f on my phone
DIE-sastre11-0553	i can look at the fax on my phone any time
DIE-sastre11-0554	i can listen to the voice mail because the email's on the phone

DIE-sastre11-0561	like the to do's
DIE-sastre11-0562	those synchronize on my phone
DIE-sastre11-0563	and on my phone i have the tasks synchronized with the computer of the office
DIE-sastre11-0564	so wherever i am it's the tasks
DIE-sastre11-0565	all that stuff as you tie it together it
DIE-sastre11-0566	you know i remember when everybody used to remember all the telephone numbers
EVE-sastre11-0567	i know
DIE-sastre11-0568	right
EVE-sastre11-0574	yeah i know
DIE-sastre11-0577	but that stuff now is in that little device
DIE-sastre11-0578	but now you look at mary's
DIE-sastre11-0579	the i phone
DIE-sastre11-0580	it has a camera that is full of megapixels
DIE-sastre11-0581	when we went to the island i bought a camera for like a thousand dollars that was great
DIE-sastre11-0582	a sony camera several years ago
DIE-sastre11-0586	the camera in her phone now is better than that one
DIE-sastre11-0587	the camera in her phone it's a higher megapixel and better quality camera than that one was
DIE-sastre11-0588	and it's this big
DIE-sastre11-0589	it's microscopic
DIE-sastre11-0590	it's a speakerphone
DIE-sastre11-0591	it has the the i pod it's in the phone
DIE-sastre11-0592	so she has eight gigabytes of music which is at least a few hundred songs maybe a few thousands songs
DIE-sastre11-0594	no no no i haven't i haven't even started
DIE-sastre11-0596	it has a g p s with a map software
DIE-sastre11-0597	so when you drive it'll tell you where to go
DIE-sastre11-0598	it'll actually talk to you
DIE-sastre11-0599	and tell you
DIE-sastre11-0600	make a left here
DIE-sastre11-0601	make a right here
DIE-sastre11-0604	you can go buy stock
DIE-sastre11-0605	they sell stock on the phone
DIE-sastre11-0606	through the same thing that is a mary trader or any of these places where you do it from your computer
DIE-sastre11-0607	the internet on the telephone is so incredible
EVE-sastre11-0611	yeah
DIE-sastre11-0612	so they develop the technology that ah
DIE-sastre11-0613	i'll have to show you this on the phone
DIE-sastre11-0617	and if you do this it zooms you out
DIE-sastre11-0618	and you can move around the page
DIE-sastre11-0619	so you zoom in
DIE-sastre11-0622	it's incredible
DIE-sastre11-0623	it's so natural
DIE-sastre11-0624	to use it's so easy
DIE-sastre11-0625	like it's intuitive
DIE-sastre11-0626	and that's what makes apple different
DIE-sastre11-0627	all of the apple products are very natural
DIE-sastre11-0628	they're very intuitive
DIE-sastre11-0629	they
DIE-sastre11-0630	i'm a microsoft company
DIE-sastre11-0631	i know what microsoft does
DIE-sastre11-0632	it's great for business
DIE-sastre11-0633	but for just being easy to use and enjoyable man the apple stuff
EVE-sastre11-0645	mm
DIE-sastre11-0652	it's amazing it's amazing
DIE-sastre11-0655	it's amazing
DIE-sastre11-0675	so you actually see the website
DIE-sastre11-0676	and then you hit to the the arrow on the keyboard
DIE-sastre11-0680	so you can see everything like if you were flipping through a catalogue you're seeing already the front of the web page
DIE-sastre11-0681	so when you're looking for something if you can see the visuals
DIE-sastre11-0683	oh that's exactly what i'm looking for boom and you're there
DIE-sastre11-0684	so instead of presenting it to you in a word list of all of the blue links with all the words and all that stuff it's giving you the website
DIE-sastre11-0685	but on the bottom if you still wanna see the words you press button
DIE-sastre11-0687	and you can scroll through the box on the bottom
DIE-sastre11-0689	it's searchme dot com and it's really really good
DIE-sastre11-0691	yeah they're testing they're testing
DIE-sastre11-0692	and it's an interesting engine
DIE-sastre11-0693	that's the question
DIE-sastre11-0694	is will the engine of what they bring back when you type a word in be as advanced in the algorithm as google is
DIE-sastre11-0695	if it is then you have something really unique
DIE-sastre11-0696	because that's what it's a visual component with a very powerful search engine
DIE-sastre11-0697	google is a very powerful search engine
DIE-sastre11-0698	it gives you good returns like when you put something in it gets close to what you're looking for
DIE-sastre11-0699	it is a good process
DIE-sastre11-0700	and think about it
DIE-sastre11-0701	their software google
DIE-sastre11-0702	it's a software
DIE-sastre11-0704	that it's a giant company right
DIE-sastre11-0705	hundreds of billions of dollars
DIE-sastre11-0706	but their software scans the entire internet
DIE-sastre11-0709	everyday
DIE-sastre11-0710	no they're trying to buy yahoo
DIE-sastre11-0712	who's google'seng biggest competitor
DIE-sastre11-0713	but the yahoo owners the board of directors that runs the company says it's too little money
DIE-sastre11-0714	they offered forty two billion
DIE-sastre11-0715	they said it's too little
DIE-sastre11-0716	they said no for forty two billion
DIE-sastre11-0718	yeah laugh
DIE-sastre11-0719	you're talking about a company that didn't exist ten years ago
DIE-sastre11-0722	and then forty two billion's too little
EVE-sastre11-0724	and that's it
DIE-sastre11-0725	yeah i know know and
DIE-sastre11-0726	microsoft'seng good
DIE-sastre11-0727	microsoft knows how to win
DIE-sastre11-0728	and specially when microsoft'seng coming in second place they know how to jump and beat the guy in first place
DIE-sastre11-0729	they're not very good at being in the first place from the beginning
DIE-sastre11-0730	apple is very good at being in first place at the beginning
DIE-sastre11-0731	apple is really really interesting
DIE-sastre11-0733	yeah yeah yeah
DIE-sastre11-0743	that those computers used to be able to process like twelve million instructions per second right
DIE-sastre11-0744	these are gigahertz computers
DIE-sastre11-0745	these can do like four billion instructions per second
DIE-sastre11-0746	and when anything can calculate that fast
DIE-sastre11-0747	you know
DIE-sastre11-0748	i can't think what it can calculate
DIE-sastre11-0749	you know
DIE-sastre11-0754	oh my god

JOC-sastre10-0178	she that little boy has only been here for a month
JEN-sastre10-0180	so
JOC-sastre10-0181	a month
JOC-sastre10-0183	yeah
JEN-sastre10-0184	a month
JOC-sastre10-0185	a month
JEN-sastre10-0187	who who are you talking about
JEN-sastre10-0188	no i was talking about that little boy
JOC-sastre10-0189	no we're talking about that little boy
JEN-sastre10-0190	oh i'm like who
JOC-sastre10-0191	he came february second from cuba
JEN-sastre10-0193	so he came to like make little friends
JOC-sastre10-0194	yeah they just landed here
JOC-sastre10-0195	and already he's learned to play wii
JEN-sastre10-0196	they just landed
JOC-sastre10-0197	and they're they've been playing for an hour
JEN-sastre10-0198	yeah marco turns on the wii
JEN-sastre10-0199	and i go
JEN-sastre10-0200	i don't think he knows how to play that
JEN-sastre10-0201	and marco goes
JEN-sastre10-0202	of course he does
JEN-sastre10-0203	and i'm like
JOC-sastre10-0205	yeah marco goes
JOC-sastre10-0206	i taught him
JOC-sastre10-0207	i taught him
JEN-sastre10-0208	i taught him
JEN-sastre10-0209	and you see the little kid
JOC-sastre10-0211	although i'll tell you marco'seng spanish is not that great
JEN-sastre10-0212	but that's good because
JOC-sastre10-0213	he really let it go
JEN-sastre10-0215	but i that's that's normal
JOC-sastre10-0216	but then on the other hand tosca'seng spanish is much better
JOC-sastre10-0217	she's also ambidextrous which is interesting
JOC-sastre10-0219	and then that's also the same thing that i think influences um she has a little bit of dyslexia
JEN-sastre10-0220	i want to go down
JEN-sastre10-0221	i want to go down
JEN-sastre10-0222	oh no
JOC-sastre10-0223	and i think it's all related
JOC-sastre10-0224	that's what i think
JEN-sastre10-0225	do you really think that it's dyslexia
JEN-sastre10-0226	i mean she's still in the learning phase
JOC-sastre10-0227	she's still in the learning stage
JOC-sastre10-0228	yeah but
JEN-sastre10-0229	i still i mean reverse numbers
JOC-sastre10-0230	no but like you tell her twenty and she'll put zero two
JEN-sastre10-0231	mm
JOC-sastre10-0232	yeah
JOC-sastre10-0233	and and there's words and stuff that
JOC-sastre10-0234	and she's also fascinated with things that go backwards and forwards
JOC-sastre10-0235	like she'll take a a piece of paper
JOC-sastre10-0236	she'll do her homework
JOC-sastre10-0237	and then she'll flip it over on the backside
JOC-sastre10-0238	and then everything that the way that it's runs through she'll recopy it all backwards on the other side
JEN-sastre10-0239	she does it backwards
JEN-sastre10-0240	oh let me see your

JOC-sastre10-0681	oh we visited this before
JEN-sastre10-0682	yeah but

JEN-sastre10-0684	because i was like
JEN-sastre10-0686	but i don't understand
JEN-sastre10-0687	how can you say that
JEN-sastre10-0688	i don't even realize that i'm doing that
JOC-sastre10-0689	i think i'm much harsher than you are though
JEN-sastre10-0690	but he says that i'm harsh
JEN-sastre10-0691	and i thought
JEN-sastre10-0692	but i don't realize that i'm doing it
JOC-sastre10-0693	but when are you harsh

JEN-sastre10-0696	i mean i don't know
JOC-sastre10-0697	uh huh
JEN-sastre10-0698	but you don't even realize that you're doing it
JEN-sastre10-0699	and you don't realize the power of your eyes
JOC-sastre10-0700	you know what you have to do
JEN-sastre10-0701	and i look at him
JOC-sastre10-0702	that's what it is
JEN-sastre10-0703	and i go
JOC-sastre10-0704	it's the facial expressions
JEN-sastre10-0705	the power
JOC-sastre10-0706	you know when i was in the academy
JEN-sastre10-0707	and i go to him
JEN-sastre10-0708	the power of my eyes
JEN-sastre10-0709	and he goes
JEN-sastre10-0710	you could sit there and say
JEN-sastre10-0711	hi how are you
JEN-sastre10-0712	but your eyes are saying i don't know what
JOC-sastre10-0713	your eyes are saying something else
JOC-sastre10-0714	well i will tell you what
JEN-sastre10-0715	and i'm like
JEN-sastre10-0716	but i don't i mean i know when i make faces
JOC-sastre10-0717	when i was in the academy i used to get in trouble for that
JEN-sastre10-0718	for making faces
JOC-sastre10-0719	for making faces
JOC-sastre10-0720	because it didn't matter if i had learned to shut up
JEN-sastre10-0721	right and you were smiling yeah
JOC-sastre10-0722	because my face said it all
JEN-sastre10-0723	yeah
JOC-sastre10-0724	i would sit there and go
JEN-sastre10-0725	right
JEN-sastre10-0726	well that's
JOC-sastre10-0727	and then the instructor would go
JOC-sastre10-0728	miss do you have a problem
JOC-sastre10-0729	and i'd have to go
JOC-sastre10-0730	you know
JEN-sastre10-0731	no i didn't say anything
JOC-sastre10-0732	and it didn't matter what i was saying
JOC-sastre10-0733	because my face was saying something else
JEN-sastre10-0734	well that's what
JEN-sastre10-0735	well you don't realize
JEN-sastre10-0736	so anyways go back to the you he tends to look at people like that
JOC-sastre10-0737	and he does the same thing
JOC-sastre10-0738	he has this he has this poker face
JEN-sastre10-0739	i don't think that's a
JEN-sastre10-0740	is that a bad thing
JOC-sastre10-0741	i don't know
JOC-sastre10-0742	he has this poker face all the time
JOC-sastre10-0743	but he's definitely mastered the art of of being quiet and observing
JEN-sastre10-0744	well i think and i've i mean i i do this because obviously i think tommy is much more quiet and observant
JEN-sastre10-0745	and i think people like that are
JEN-sastre10-0746	i don't wanna say that they're smarter or more
JEN-sastre10-0747	i think they're a better judge of character
JOC-sastre10-0748	it's a talent
JEN-sastre10-0749	it's a talent
JOC-sastre10-0750	it's enviable

JOC-sastre10-0800	that's her social hour
JEN-sastre10-0801	that's her social hour
JEN-sastre10-0803	you know if you had one patient
JEN-sastre10-0804	but you have ten fifteen patients going at a time
JEN-sastre10-0806	i don't have the time
JEN-sastre10-0807	and no matter how much i really want to sit there and answer her questions and not be rude i can't sit there and answer especially when they're just redundant questions
JOC-sastre10-0808	reminds me of something
JOC-sastre10-0809	go ahead
JEN-sastre10-0810	when they're just

JEN-sastre10-0830	i don't know what to tell you
JEN-sastre10-0831	i told her that
JOC-sastre10-0832	you're not supposed to feel good at this point
JEN-sastre10-0833	yeah i told her
JEN-sastre10-0838	whatever

JOC-sastre10-0841	she wants to see the progress
JEN-sastre10-0842	yeah yeah
JEN-sastre10-0843	no and then she tells me
JEN-sastre10-0844	and they did x rays
JEN-sastre10-0846	you know how they normally give you like the sheet which the guy the doctor actually has to interpret and say
JEN-sastre10-0847	we found a fracture
JEN-sastre10-0848	we found this or whatever
JEN-sastre10-0849	i go
JEN-sastre10-0852	so look i go
JEN-sastre10-0853	for your
JEN-sastre10-0854	i mean she can get it
JEN-sastre10-0855	it's her personal records
JEN-sastre10-0856	and i go
JEN-sastre10-0857	ok for your records
JEN-sastre10-0858	no because i have a a friend whose a doctor in cuba
JEN-sastre10-0861	and he's gonna tell me what i have to do
JOC-sastre10-0862	and he wants to look at them
JEN-sastre10-0865	because that just riles me up

JOC-sastre10-1167	no as far as i'm concerned i'm cool and hip
JEN-sastre10-1168	because everybody that you know that's your age more or less fits the bill i think
JOC-sastre10-1169	i don't know but
JEN-sastre10-1170	so when you see someone it's like short
JOC-sastre10-1171	but i mean think of it
JEN-sastre10-1172	does that happen to you with the shortness
JEN-sastre10-1173	like i i know that i'm short
JEN-sastre10-1174	but i don't realize it until
JOC-sastre10-1175	i i think i'm big
JEN-sastre10-1176	until either i'm standing next to someone very tall or i see someone very short
JEN-sastre10-1177	like the other day i was in publix
JEN-sastre10-1178	and i i just cracked myself up
JEN-sastre10-1179	i was there pushing my little cart
JEN-sastre10-1180	and from a distance there was a
JEN-sastre10-1181	she must have been philapino or something
JEN-sastre10-1182	the lady was like this tiny
JOC-sastre10-1183	yes i saw one in the mall yesterday
JEN-sastre10-1184	she was like this tiny
JOC-sastre10-1185	yes
JEN-sastre10-1186	and i'm as i'm pushing the cart
JEN-sastre10-1187	mind you she's far away
JEN-sastre10-1188	and i go
JEN-sastre10-1189	short whisper
JOC-sastre10-1190	she's very short whisper
JEN-sastre10-1191	and i'm doing the whole to myself
JOC-sastre10-1192	yeah yeah yeah
JEN-sastre10-1193	as soon as i walked by her she was still shorter than me
JEN-sastre10-1194	but couple of inches
JOC-sastre10-1195	but not that much
JEN-sastre10-1197	and i thought
JEN-sastre10-1198	oh my god is that what i look like pushing the frikking publix cart
JEN-sastre10-1200	because i don't feel that that's what i look like
JEN-sastre10-1201	i feel that i'm walking around very tall and proud
JOC-sastre10-1202	well i think i'm tall until kathy comes over
JEN-sastre10-1203	right mm yeah
JOC-sastre10-1204	she's eleven
JEN-sastre10-1205	yeah
JEN-sastre10-1206	and then you go

JEN-sastre10-1209	and you're taller than
JOC-sastre10-1210	right
JEN-sastre10-1211	yeah
JOC-sastre10-1212	right
JOC-sastre10-1213	and and i really i do think i'm i'm big
JOC-sastre10-1214	and it's funny
JOC-sastre10-1215	because people at work think i'm big too
JEN-sastre10-1216	well because i think either they know you already
JEN-sastre10-1217	they don't associate
JOC-sastre10-1218	that's something that somebody somebody used to tell me all the time
JEN-sastre10-1219	or your personality
JOC-sastre10-1220	whenever and and as a matter of fact i get that comment a lot
JOC-sastre10-1221	and then and i even get it from frank
JOC-sastre10-1222	and frank'seng only like five eight five nine
JEN-sastre10-1223	he's five eight five nine

JEN-sastre10-1239	that was extreme too
JOC-sastre10-1240	so he's five ten so i'm good
JEN-sastre10-1241	yeah it doesn't
JEN-sastre10-1242	no it's still good right
JOC-sastre10-1243	but it's funny how people who know me and even people who know me who see me every day now that he gets to stand up close to me and put his arms around me and he says things like

KEV-sastre1-0011	no
SOF-sastre1-0065	it's beautiful
KEV-sastre1-0080	and i set it up in the in the campground
SOF-sastre1-0082	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0083	it's not even
KEV-sastre1-0084	so that's something to
SOF-sastre1-0086	this is great back here
KEV-sastre1-0087	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0088	and this month that is pretty cool
KEV-sastre1-0089	it's really really nice
KEV-sastre1-0090	when it gets to july and august it gets hot
KEV-sastre1-0091	you gotta wait until almost the end of the day
KEV-sastre1-0092	that starts cooling off a little bit to be out here
KEV-sastre1-0093	at at at three thirty four o'clock it's fine
SOF-sastre1-0094	ah but thank god you don't have to worry about a pool
SOF-sastre1-0096	because pools are good for when you have smaller kids but already
SOF-sastre1-0097	they don't even wanna jump in it
KEV-sastre1-0098	eh we had a hard time finding the house
KEV-sastre1-0099	because we were looking for a house in miami lakes on the lake without the pool
KEV-sastre1-0100	and that's that made it very difficult in nineteen ninety eight when we bought here finding that
KEV-sastre1-0101	we couldn't find it
KEV-sastre1-0102	we couldn't find any house
SOF-sastre1-0103	most of the houses have pool
KEV-sastre1-0104	they all have pools
KEV-sastre1-0105	and then we came across this one
KEV-sastre1-0116	a house on the lake without a pool is almost impossible to find
SOF-sastre1-0117	but you've done a lot to this house
KEV-sastre1-0118	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0119	you have done so much
SOF-sastre1-0120	it's incredible
KEV-sastre1-0121	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0123	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0125	eh we are gonna redo the bathroom
KEV-sastre1-0126	ah my idea originally was just to leave the tub
KEV-sastre1-0129	change
SOF-sastre1-0130	make it a shower
SOF-sastre1-0131	you don't like showers
KEV-sastre1-0132	no we are gonna put a tub a tub but a new tub
SOF-sastre1-0133	oh ok
KEV-sastre1-0134	because it's gonna be very hard to leave an old tub
KEV-sastre1-0135	and then match everything else to the old tub
KEV-sastre1-0136	so kind of a
KEV-sastre1-0137	we are gonna redo redo the whole thing
SOF-sastre1-0140	humidity
SOF-sastre1-0158	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0161	but it's fairly small
KEV-sastre1-0162	and when you get to the place you have to actually put it up
SOF-sastre1-0163	up
KEV-sastre1-0164	and and open it and put it together
KEV-sastre1-0165	the other one no
KEV-sastre1-0166	the other one everything is in place
KEV-sastre1-0167	you just get there
SOF-sastre1-0168	and press the button
KEV-sastre1-0169	press the
SOF-sastre1-0170	right
KEV-sastre1-0171	and
SOF-sastre1-0172	and everything opens up
KEV-sastre1-0173	you don't even have
SOF-sastre1-0174	my friend has an r v
SOF-sastre1-0175	it's beautiful
SOF-sastre1-0176	oh my god it looks like a house
SOF-sastre1-0179	but it's big
SOF-sastre1-0180	you know
SOF-sastre1-0182	and he takes it with him
SOF-sastre1-0183	i mean it's wow
SOF-sastre1-0184	he presses the button
SOF-sastre1-0186	that whole thing like opens up
SOF-sastre1-0187	it's got a master bedroom
KEV-sastre1-0188	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0189	and a
SOF-sastre1-0191	and two other bedrooms with a bathroom pretty big
SOF-sastre1-0193	i mean it's really nice

KEV-sastre1-0197	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0198	flat screen tvs i mean he's got it
KEV-sastre1-0200	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0201	because he likes to go to the keys a lot
KEV-sastre1-0202	yah the keys are getting very
SOF-sastre1-0203	expensive
KEV-sastre1-0204	right difficult expensive and difficult with
KEV-sastre1-0205	it's very hard to find a camping spot spot over there
SOF-sastre1-0206	space now
SOF-sastre1-0207	yeah because what they do is they build now on them instead of
KEV-sastre1-0208	right they close them
KEV-sastre1-0209	they close american outdoors they close a a bunch of them
SOF-sastre1-0210	yes because people are making money selling the property so
KEV-sastre1-0212	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0213	they don't make as much renting as they do selling
KEV-sastre1-0214	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0215	and the campgrounds were beautiful places to build on
KEV-sastre1-0216	because they were huge pieces of property a lot of them right on the ocean on the water
KEV-sastre1-0217	so you know it was a good deal
SOF-sastre1-0218	yes
KEV-sastre1-0219	so they closed them
KEV-sastre1-0221	american outdoors was a beautiful place
KEV-sastre1-0222	and they just closed it down
SOF-sastre1-0224	wow

SOF-sastre1-0246	and they are little
SOF-sastre1-0248	they don't grow much
KEV-sastre1-0249	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0252	and i have some another doctor over there that has a miniature pig
KEV-sastre1-0253	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0254	that's the daughter's pet
SOF-sastre1-0255	it's a pig
SOF-sastre1-0257	but the little ones the miniature ones
SOF-sastre1-0258	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0259	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0260	how cute
SOF-sastre1-0261	everybody has their own pet
KEV-sastre1-0263	how is everything at the hospital
SOF-sastre1-0264	good
SOF-sastre1-0266	it's busy but it's good
SOF-sastre1-0268	you know they have more work less people
KEV-sastre1-0269	yeah and less money
SOF-sastre1-0270	every yeah because you have to work double so
KEV-sastre1-0271	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0272	yeah yeah we've been three years without a raise
KEV-sastre1-0273	because
SOF-sastre1-0274	i mean what we do is they give us like a raise i mean is it depends on how much you make
SOF-sastre1-0275	but basically what it does is then every year they put up the insurances so high
SOF-sastre1-0277	that the little money that you are making
KEV-sastre1-0278	they take it away
SOF-sastre1-0279	it's they take it away with the insurance so really you are not seeing much
SOF-sastre1-0281	it's just like there's no raise
SOF-sastre1-0283	you know
SOF-sastre1-0284	and i'm the one that pays the insurance because my husband's insurance is much more expensive
KEV-sastre1-0285	that's it yeah
SOF-sastre1-0286	yeah because since i work for you know they have a lot more
KEV-sastre1-0287	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0288	so you know it's
SOF-sastre1-0290	insurance is cheaper but still
KEV-sastre1-0293	i'm not gonna have to carry her in my insurance any more
SOF-sastre1-0294	yeah
KEV-sastre1-0295	because she'll have her own insurance and for her working for the county the insurance is free
KEV-sastre1-0296	and for pepa is free
KEV-sastre1-0297	and i pay if it's just for me it's just like thirty dollars a month
SOF-sastre1-0298	no that's not bad
SOF-sastre1-0300	and isn't it better for you to go with her with the with the county no
KEV-sastre1-0301	no because if we go into the family plan her plan is more expensive than mine
SOF-sastre1-0302	oh i see
KEV-sastre1-0303	that's why i had it
KEV-sastre1-0304	i had the insurance under me for pepita
SOF-sastre1-0305	oh ok
KEV-sastre1-0306	and me because pepa had her own
KEV-sastre1-0307	but now that pepa has her own and pepita is gonna get her own then i can get mine on my own
KEV-sastre1-0308	it's thirty some dollars which is not a bad deal
SOF-sastre1-0309	but my brother my brother was telling me that that that law that came about with the homestead exemption
SOF-sastre1-0311	that he was saying that you know that it's not worth it
SOF-sastre1-0312	he was telling me that so many people from the county are gonna lose jobs because of that
SOF-sastre1-0313	they are gonna take you know they are gonna cut the cut down is gonna be so drastic
SOF-sastre1-0314	and the people what they are gonna save for the homestead is so minimal that it wasn't worth it
SOF-sastre1-0315	and i said well
KEV-sastre1-0316	yeah
SOF-sastre1-0318	everybody is looking for a buck
SOF-sastre1-0320	no

KEV-sastre1-0323	right
KEV-sastre1-0324	that was five years ago

COL-sastre13-0007	so he can get so he can get the rest of the democrats that she has because she has a couple
COL-sastre13-0008	they want him to get the rest of the democrats
COL-sastre13-0010	and if he gets the rest of the democrats that's it
COL-sastre13-0011	he becomes the next president

COL-sastre13-0024	no no no it's not that they already know who's gonna win
COL-sastre13-0025	what's happened is basically that um they're running against each other for the same within the same party
COL-sastre13-0027	like they're both on the same team if you will
ELI-sastre13-0028	oh ok
COL-sastre13-0029	and basically like you know there's there comes a certain point when you you already know

COL-sastre13-0606	it happens though
COL-sastre13-0607	it's not it's not just you
COL-sastre13-0608	a lot of people live like that
ELI-sastre13-0609	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0610	i know
COL-sastre13-0611	the to be honest with you like that's one of the things that i'm very grateful for right now that i have so much free time in the summer
COL-sastre13-0613	because i've come to realize that especially during the these last two semesters at school like i've been spending just so much time like just doing crazy stuff like trying to get stuff done
COL-sastre13-0615	and always like hurrying
COL-sastre13-0616	and always being like you know
COL-sastre13-0617	trying to be like one step ahead of everything
ELI-sastre13-0618	yeah yeah
COL-sastre13-0619	and i'm like
COL-sastre13-0620	like i don't know like about maybe like a week ago is when i finally just like let go of all that
COL-sastre13-0621	you know just like just relax
COL-sastre13-0622	and finally just let it go
ELI-sastre13-0623	yeah
COL-sastre13-0624	like you don't really have to do anything tomorrow you know just
ELI-sastre13-0625	yeah
COL-sastre13-0626	and like i i rested
COL-sastre13-0627	and i was like
COL-sastre13-0628	i realize like man you know like man so much time like gets wasted on like you know watching television you know like looking stuff up on the internet
COL-sastre13-0629	something you don't even need to look up just like garbage
ELI-sastre13-0630	yeah
COL-sastre13-0631	you know and it's like
ELI-sastre13-0632	yeah
COL-sastre13-0633	when i finally just let it go i was just like ah
COL-sastre13-0634	like i finally like just read i finally i read an entire magazine like between yesterday and today
ELI-sastre13-0635	yeah
COL-sastre13-0636	and i was like
ELI-sastre13-0637	god
COL-sastre13-0638	oh this is great
COL-sastre13-0639	you know i read the entire magazine
ELI-sastre13-0641	that's something really like oh my god like
ELI-sastre13-0642	so already have like your bachelors
ELI-sastre13-0643	like i i wish i could already be there like
ELI-sastre13-0644	i feel like school is like i like
COL-sastre13-0645	i mean it's not it's not enough
COL-sastre13-0646	i mean just having a bachelors is not
COL-sastre13-0647	it's it's all about you
COL-sastre13-0648	you know it really is about you
ELI-sastre13-0650	yeah
COL-sastre13-0651	you know like i i like the degree
COL-sastre13-0652	i'm not gonna lie to you
COL-sastre13-0653	i think it's nice and everything
COL-sastre13-0654	but i don't think the degree defines who i am you know
COL-sastre13-0656	it's the degree is just a reflection of like my commitment you know of what i decided to do you know in my life you know
COL-sastre13-0657	like i already i had i already knew like that summer like when i came back to school that you know i was gonna finish
COL-sastre13-0658	one way or another i was gonna finish
COL-sastre13-0659	and the only thing that i kept telling me uh telling myself is like colin you have four years left
COL-sastre13-0660	you know you just have to hang in there for four years
COL-sastre13-0661	just keep going
ELI-sastre13-0662	yeah
COL-sastre13-0663	that's the only way i made it through
COL-sastre13-0664	there were times when like like i was like really messed up where it's like you know i had to stay up for like three a m in the morning four a m in the morning like writing a paper and stuff like that
COL-sastre13-0665	and it's hard
ELI-sastre13-0666	it was funny
ELI-sastre13-0667	last night i was talking to maria for awhile
ELI-sastre13-0668	and like
COL-sastre13-0669	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0670	she like she was we were just talking about it like man
ELI-sastre13-0671	i was telling her the same thing i'm telling you like that i feel like i just started college
ELI-sastre13-0672	and like oh my god like three more years
ELI-sastre13-0673	and like not even because i haven't finished my first year yet
ELI-sastre13-0674	and then she's like
ELI-sastre13-0675	well you know think about like this like
ELI-sastre13-0676	she said that like
ELI-sastre13-0677	and it's the same it's the same thing i was thinking
ELI-sastre13-0678	like in high school like when you were a freshman you were thinking the same thing
ELI-sastre13-0680	you were just
ELI-sastre13-0681	oh my god four years of high school
ELI-sastre13-0682	it's gonna take forever
COL-sastre13-0683	right
ELI-sastre13-0684	and like now it's like you think about it
ELI-sastre13-0685	and like man it's already been a year that i'm out of high school
COL-sastre13-0686	hmm
ELI-sastre13-0687	you know and it's like now you wish you could go back
ELI-sastre13-0688	you know
ELI-sastre13-0689	so it's like
ELI-sastre13-0691	i mean even though high school's very different from college
ELI-sastre13-0692	but either way you know
COL-sastre13-0693	it just depends
COL-sastre13-0694	i mean there's a point in your life when you realize that
COL-sastre13-0695	i like that's interesting that you say that
COL-sastre13-0696	because i don't really know what exactly it is about high school that you wanna go back like what it is about high school that you like so much
COL-sastre13-0697	that's the thing
ELI-sastre13-0698	what it is about high school that i
ELI-sastre13-0699	that's a very easy question ok
COL-sastre13-0700	what is it
ELI-sastre13-0701	you don't have
ELI-sastre13-0702	in high school like everything was easy for everybody mostly everybody ok you
ELI-sastre13-0704	you didn't have you had responsibilities
ELI-sastre13-0705	but not as big as the ones we have
ELI-sastre13-0706	and ok i'm i'm gonna be honest with you
COL-sastre13-0707	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0708	in high school i barely remember it
ELI-sastre13-0709	^ like i think the most times that i ever like opened a book was like three times
ELI-sastre13-0711	to study
COL-sastre13-0712	right
ELI-sastre13-0713	you know
ELI-sastre13-0714	and then in college i've had to learn like your your grade is based on tests
ELI-sastre13-0716	you know if you don't open that book and read you're gonna fail
COL-sastre13-0717	right
ELI-sastre13-0718	you know
ELI-sastre13-0719	so it's like so then like i guess like in college now i'm kind of trying to like redeem myself for high school
ELI-sastre13-0720	because i didn't do good in high school like
COL-sastre13-0721	right right
ELI-sastre13-0722	i was an average student
ELI-sastre13-0723	i i had like a what
ELI-sastre13-0724	i graduated with like a two point like
COL-sastre13-0725	right
ELI-sastre13-0726	six or something a two point seven like
COL-sastre13-0727	when i was that actually my my my college g p a went down to a two point one so
ELI-sastre13-0728	yeah
COL-sastre13-0729	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0730	but
COL-sastre13-0731	no what am i
COL-sastre13-0732	wait
COL-sastre13-0733	two point one
COL-sastre13-0734	no what am i talking about
COL-sastre13-0735	one point a one point two
ELI-sastre13-0736	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0737	but i guess in a way like in college i'm trying to do my best that i can
ELI-sastre13-0738	you know and then i realize i'm like
ELI-sastre13-0739	because i never thought like i would look at those like like smart kids and stuff
ELI-sastre13-0740	and it's like nah
ELI-sastre13-0741	and like i wish i could go back
ELI-sastre13-0742	and like get like bright futures and all that crazy stuff and
COL-sastre13-0743	well
COL-sastre13-0744	it's it's
COL-sastre13-0746	i don't think it's really about
COL-sastre13-0747	i don't know
COL-sastre13-0748	i've been to people's houses that like you know that you know have education have an education
COL-sastre13-0749	and they have several degrees
COL-sastre13-0750	and stuff like that
COL-sastre13-0751	and to be honest with you it's not
COL-sastre13-0752	you know i look at their lives
COL-sastre13-0753	and and i don't really want that life
COL-sastre13-0754	you know like that's not what i want
ELI-sastre13-0755	yeah
COL-sastre13-0756	you know i don't look at their lives and say like wow you know i envy that
COL-sastre13-0757	you know and that's what i want
ELI-sastre13-0758	yeah
COL-sastre13-0759	um the only to me like the only motivation for me to like do well is is first for myself and also for you know for whatever future i might have with somebody else basically
COL-sastre13-0762	you know i think of it in that in that sense you know
COL-sastre13-0763	i i always wanna be i always have a backup plan you know
COL-sastre13-0764	i always wanna be prepared in case anything might happen
ELI-sastre13-0765	yeah
COL-sastre13-0766	and it's just having a better life for you know for not just yourself but for other people too
COL-sastre13-0767	you know
ELI-sastre13-0768	yeah
COL-sastre13-0769	you bring something to the table like you know whenever like you meet anybody
COL-sastre13-0770	so yeah but trust me
COL-sastre13-0771	just because you have an education doesn't mean squat like
ELI-sastre13-0772	it's true
COL-sastre13-0773	like that girl that i told you about that i like i went out for like a for like a month she was like she's working on her masters now and it's like like you just feel bad for her
COL-sastre13-0774	like honestly that's the only thing i can tell you
COL-sastre13-0775	like i felt bad for her
COL-sastre13-0776	because like there's nothing you can do like
COL-sastre13-0777	you know it's like she's thirty and she still hasn't figured out that you know if she doesn't like put on the batteries like she's just gonna be alone for like the rest of her life like
ELI-sastre13-0778	oh my god you see that's something i don't want
ELI-sastre13-0779	i don't wanna be alone
COL-sastre13-0780	my god she's like thirty
COL-sastre13-0781	and like she she just turned thirty
COL-sastre13-0782	and she's like still like going out like partying and drinking and stuff like that
ELI-sastre13-0783	yeah
COL-sastre13-0784	and it's just like
COL-sastre13-0785	i'm like
COL-sastre13-0786	and like she's having such a hard time like letting go of like that part of her life
COL-sastre13-0787	like she's kinda like has like half and half right now
ELI-sastre13-0788	my god
COL-sastre13-0789	so whatever i'm like whatever
COL-sastre13-0790	but that's you know that's that's her choice
COL-sastre13-0791	you know like that's her choice
COL-sastre13-0792	what ends up what happens with most people though is that um they don't realize that they don't really know what they want you know
COL-sastre13-0793	i actually asked this to my mom the other day
COL-sastre13-0794	like i was like
COL-sastre13-0795	tell me the truth
COL-sastre13-0796	when you were like young you know did you know what you want with your life
COL-sastre13-0797	and she was like
COL-sastre13-0798	no
COL-sastre13-0799	and i was like
COL-sastre13-0800	ah ha you see i knew it
COL-sastre13-0802	and i just walked away
COL-sastre13-0804	that's what happens though
COL-sastre13-0806	that's what happens
ELI-sastre13-0807	that's why i try to think about that sometimes
ELI-sastre13-0808	like man i hope i'm choosing like the right career
ELI-sastre13-0809	and like
COL-sastre13-0810	just the thing is
ELI-sastre13-0811	i'm trying to learn like one thing i'm trying to change about myself now is like
ELI-sastre13-0812	because like you're though like these last couple of months man like it's been hitting me hard like
ELI-sastre13-0813	like like now i'm trying to like realize like man like
ELI-sastre13-0814	i used to be so happy all the time you know
ELI-sastre13-0815	and then like there like they used to be like like this these last couple of months i'm like oh my god
ELI-sastre13-0816	and you know like i was thinking that this isn't me you know like
ELI-sastre13-0818	i didn't i used to care but like not where i made it like
ELI-sastre13-0820	the centre of my life you know like
COL-sastre13-0821	you know what you know why because what ends up happening is that eventually the problems that you might not have paid attention to like you eventually say to yourself
ELI-sastre13-0822	yeah
COL-sastre13-0823	you know i gotta resolve them
COL-sastre13-0824	it happened to me too
COL-sastre13-0825	there are problems that you have to take care of
ELI-sastre13-0826	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0827	but i don't know
ELI-sastre13-0828	like i'm i'm i'm good now
ELI-sastre13-0829	i'm not
COL-sastre13-0830	you just have to learn to be happy regardless of what you're doing
ELI-sastre13-0832	yeah i know
COL-sastre13-0833	regardless of what you're doing
COL-sastre13-0834	you just have to learn how to do that
COL-sastre13-0835	like me it doesn't where you put me
COL-sastre13-0836	my mom laughs
COL-sastre13-0837	she's like
COL-sastre13-0838	it's fine
COL-sastre13-0839	you know you can come like a week before the wedding
COL-sastre13-0840	it doesn't matter
COL-sastre13-0841	we'll just put you in the living room with a book
COL-sastre13-0842	and you'll be fine
ELI-sastre13-0843	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0845	it's true
COL-sastre13-0846	so that's something that you have to learn
COL-sastre13-0847	like but whatever
COL-sastre13-0848	no it's you know it's interesting
ELI-sastre13-0849	what
COL-sastre13-0850	i dunno like
COL-sastre13-0851	i think that sometimes that i think we try to get away from from feeling you know and and thinking about things about things that should matter
COL-sastre13-0852	you know
ELI-sastre13-0853	you think
COL-sastre13-0854	i think so
COL-sastre13-0855	i think that that's the point of having so many distractions
ELI-sastre13-0856	yeah
COL-sastre13-0857	for example i think that sometimes people get scared of being like absolutely alone like with nothing going on
ELI-sastre13-0858	really
COL-sastre13-0859	yeah
COL-sastre13-0860	like people get like you put them in like for example have you
COL-sastre13-0861	what's the longest you've spent like by yourself with like nothing going on
ELI-sastre13-0863	i don't even think like five minutes like i
COL-sastre13-0864	you see
COL-sastre13-0865	you see
ELI-sastre13-0866	i hate it
ELI-sastre13-0867	like oh my god
ELI-sastre13-0868	like
COL-sastre13-0869	but why
ELI-sastre13-0870	i dunno
COL-sastre13-0871	why do you hate it
ELI-sastre13-0872	that's one thing about me like that's like really like oh my god
ELI-sastre13-0873	i hate being alone
ELI-sastre13-0874	like i hate being alone
ELI-sastre13-0875	i don't like being alone
ELI-sastre13-0877	if i'm in my house and i'm like oh my god like there's nothing to do nobody here like i'm leaving
ELI-sastre13-0878	you know like i would run
COL-sastre13-0879	yeah you go do something else right
ELI-sastre13-0880	i'm just gonna go for a drive or something and like laughs blast my music
ELI-sastre13-0881	i dunno it's like you know
COL-sastre13-0883	i i'm actually quite like the opposite
COL-sastre13-0884	like the thing is this like it's hard like it's hard to get to a place where you're just like you're alone like and you can actually think you know and just think about whatever comes into your head you know like
COL-sastre13-0886	you know why are things the way they are you know
COL-sastre13-0887	have all these like weird thoughts
COL-sastre13-0888	and it's like
COL-sastre13-0889	i feel like most of your life you go through you go through it
COL-sastre13-0890	you know you just
COL-sastre13-0891	people like yelling in your ear all the time
COL-sastre13-0892	that's what it feels like to me
COL-sastre13-0893	like it feels like people are always yelling at me
COL-sastre13-0894	you know like not literally
COL-sastre13-0895	you know what i mean like
ELI-sastre13-0896	no like people literally yell at me all the time
COL-sastre13-0897	but that's what i feel like it's like it's happening
COL-sastre13-0899	like there's always like something going on
COL-sastre13-0900	and then it's never like we never get a chance to just like think
ELI-sastre13-0901	yeah
COL-sastre13-0902	you know just like concentrate on like
COL-sastre13-0903	it's funny because it's like
COL-sastre13-0904	i've been sitting around and thinking about the test you know and studying for it
COL-sastre13-0905	and i'm thinking to myself
COL-sastre13-0906	man you know it's taking so long
COL-sastre13-0907	i wanted to get it done in a month
COL-sastre13-0908	you know i was like
COL-sastre13-0910	yeah you know i'm gonna study for a month and that's it
COL-sastre13-0911	it's gonna be over and that's it
COL-sastre13-0912	i don't have to think about it any more
ELI-sastre13-0913	yeah
COL-sastre13-0914	and you know what i've realized
COL-sastre13-0915	that the things that surround you make you want to like do things faster by not paying as much attention to them
COL-sastre13-0916	you know or not put as much value to them
COL-sastre13-0917	you know and i think that's just i think it shouldn't be that way
ELI-sastre13-0918	yeah
COL-sastre13-0919	i think that sometimes you really have to slow down and think about what it is that you have you know and appreciate it
ELI-sastre13-0920	it's true
ELI-sastre13-0921	but i don't think i don't think that a lot of people have that mentality
COL-sastre13-0922	well i don't think that a lot of people can even even think about that stuff
COL-sastre13-0923	i mean period so
ELI-sastre13-0924	yeah
COL-sastre13-0925	you know what i what i found in the back of a magazine about three three days ago
COL-sastre13-0926	guess what i found
COL-sastre13-0928	guess what i found three days ago
ELI-sastre13-0929	what
COL-sastre13-0930	um popeye

ELI-sastre13-0935	ah
ELI-sastre13-0936	oh i haven't seen popeye in forever
ELI-sastre13-0937	that used to be one of my favorite shows
COL-sastre13-0938	i know
COL-sastre13-0939	i know
COL-sastre13-0940	i know
ELI-sastre13-0941	aw that's so cool
COL-sastre13-0942	i was like i looked at it
COL-sastre13-0943	and i was like
COL-sastre13-0944	hmm
ELI-sastre13-0946	oh my god do you know what i used to watch a lot too
ELI-sastre13-0947	i used to watch the power rangers
COL-sastre13-0948	what
COL-sastre13-0949	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0950	and the ninja turtles laughs
COL-sastre13-0951	power rangers was when it first came out was really popular
ELI-sastre13-0952	yeah
COL-sastre13-0953	a popular show
ELI-sastre13-0954	aw i miss all those things
COL-sastre13-0955	and it's like it's on is gone on like forever
COL-sastre13-0956	power rangers is still on on the air
ELI-sastre13-0957	yeah but
COL-sastre13-0958	it's just in like weird like cable channels
ELI-sastre13-0960	yeah but i don't think it would be the same as
COL-sastre13-0961	oh
ELI-sastre13-0962	or i don't know if it's
ELI-sastre13-0963	like ok because you like the other day
ELI-sastre13-0964	not the other day
ELI-sastre13-0965	but like like i would start like
ELI-sastre13-0966	once like when i was in high school and i was like a freshman i was like man like
ELI-sastre13-0967	now like you know you see like christmas and all those things
ELI-sastre13-0968	yeah and like man the holidays the holidays any more
ELI-sastre13-0969	do you think it's because you view it differently because you're older now
ELI-sastre13-0970	like
COL-sastre13-0971	it has to do it has to do with the same thing that i told you about before
COL-sastre13-0972	because you don't put as much value to it as you used to
ELI-sastre13-0973	oh yeah
COL-sastre13-0974	that's it
COL-sastre13-0975	it's been thirty minutes
COL-sastre13-0977	then get outta here
COL-sastre13-0978	we're having a conversation
COL-sastre13-0981	um i think it's for the same reason
ELI-sastre13-0982	really
COL-sastre13-0983	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0984	yeah
ELI-sastre13-0985	so maybe it does have a little bit to do with people growing
COL-sastre13-0986	i think if you slow down i think it would be still as important
COL-sastre13-0987	because it's not it's to be honest with you it is it's not about the presents
COL-sastre13-0988	it's really more about the feelings that you get and you know like what you want
ELI-sastre13-0989	christmas spirit
COL-sastre13-0990	yeah exactly
ELI-sastre13-0991	yeah
COL-sastre13-0992	you know like that anxiety of like getting up at like twelve a m in the morning to open up your gift

GAB-herring14-0060	yeah
GAB-herring14-0061	most students don't care about like voting and stuff

GAB-herring14-0063	like a million people wanna give you a flyer and food
CON-herring14-0064	yeah because i think most of those people are because they don't live here so is like
CON-herring14-0065	i've just come here to study that's it
GAB-herring14-0066	yeah
CON-herring14-0067	i don't i don't mind
GAB-herring14-0069	i was eating in subway and then
GAB-herring14-0070	subway with the cup laugh
GAB-herring14-0071	yeah laugh
GAB-herring14-0073	um i was eating food and the girl in front of me was saying like
GAB-herring14-0074	oh i was at the library those people were bothering me
GAB-herring14-0075	and telling me but i don't care about that i really don't care about this place
GAB-herring14-0076	so like she is kind of like shows the typical attitude of like
CON-herring14-0077	yeah
GAB-herring14-0078	people not want it to go
CON-herring14-0079	but in my case probably if i would live here i would care because they can deal with issues and stuff
GAB-herring14-0080	yeah
GAB-herring14-0081	i think most students would be more involved if they had more time
GAB-herring14-0082	but they have a full schedule
GAB-herring14-0083	they have they may have a job
GAB-herring14-0084	and then they have to study
GAB-herring14-0085	so they're like
GAB-herring14-0086	i don't
GAB-herring14-0087	that's wasting my time
GAB-herring14-0088	they don't stop to like find out about who's president cause they're too busy
GAB-herring14-0089	and i understand them cause that happens to me
CON-herring14-0090	but i don't know but i don't know if those * people are like doing campaign and getting people to know their their ideas

GAB-herring14-0539	but it's like you don't have you don't get a saving
CON-herring14-0540	but
GAB-herring14-0541	it's like
CON-herring14-0542	for example if you your career is doing that it's good
CON-herring14-0543	but my case wouldn't be
CON-herring14-0545	because this this helps you to develop a curriculum
CON-herring14-0546	it's not about developing curriculum either
CON-herring14-0550	oh my goodness
CON-herring14-0554	are you sure it's a cow
GAB-herring14-0556	or a horse

CON-herring14-0570	let me see
CON-herring14-0571	oh my god

GAB-herring14-0574	i love it
GAB-herring14-0575	you get to meet so much so many people
GAB-herring14-0577	but uh
CON-herring14-0580	ah

CON-herring14-0634	like the approach you have for everything
CON-herring14-0647	and that would be like bothersome because
CON-herring14-0652	but it's good also
CON-herring14-0653	because
CON-herring14-0654	ah i don't know
CON-herring14-0655	the building would have to be thinner
CON-herring14-0656	but what's good about this it's because is this deep it allows the air go beneath the the building so
CON-herring14-0658	so that's why this is so fresh
CON-herring14-0659	they did it in that way because this is always like that
GAB-herring14-0660	yeah
CON-herring14-0664	it's like pressure
CON-herring14-0674	slippery
CON-herring14-0679	ah
GAB-herring14-0686	ah
CON-herring14-0693	that would mean more
GAB-herring14-0697	would it be people friendly
GAB-herring14-0698	like
GAB-herring14-0699	i like furniture and buildings and i like people friendly not

AAR-sastre6-0102	and that goes in through their town
AAR-sastre6-0103	and then from there we cross over i think it's into ah state road thirty one eh or four thirty one
AAR-sastre6-0104	and that takes us all the way across into immokalee

AAR-sastre6-0107	yeah it's a it's a little town
ALY-sastre6-0108	no i remember seeing the sign
ALY-sastre6-0109	but i don't know exactly what it is
AAR-sastre6-0110	it looks a little bit like um
AAR-sastre6-0111	i don't know
AAR-sastre6-0112	it looks it looks a little bit like ah naples
AAR-sastre6-0113	ah something like that
AAR-sastre6-0114	on the outer reaches of naples
AAR-sastre6-0115	because it's not as uh as modern as naples
AAR-sastre6-0116	because it's all imagine it's all uh agricultural

AAR-sastre6-0119	and like i said the only thing there's there is just pretty much um mexicans

AAR-sastre6-0480	and you're supposed to actually you know if there's something on the road or some kind of an obstacle since everybody's riding together if you're in front the guys in back can't really see when they're coming up to it

IRI-herring17-0010	yeah they were
JAM-herring17-0011	like too strong
JAM-herring17-0012	too too much strong
IRI-herring17-0013	too much
IRI-herring17-0014	yeah no no
JAM-herring17-0015	but now the dose is so slight
IRI-herring17-0016	basically
IRI-herring17-0017	but look at this
IRI-herring17-0020	i wanna i wanna do more natural things because i really
IRI-herring17-0021	i'm already on medication
IRI-herring17-0022	i'm already on effexor
IRI-herring17-0023	and i've been on antidepressants since i was seventeen
IRI-herring17-0024	so i've already been fucked
IRI-herring17-0025	you know i've already had my body being dependent on on medicine
IRI-herring17-0026	i don't want to take even more medicine if i could find something else that helps me
JAM-herring17-0027	but i wouldn't say that hormones are
JAM-herring17-0028	i don't know
JAM-herring17-0029	for me it's a natural way to regulate stuff
IRI-herring17-0030	yes but
IRI-herring17-0031	but i could find
IRI-herring17-0032	yeah but those things those things are synthetic hormones
IRI-herring17-0033	that's why they're more powerful
IRI-herring17-0034	they have more side effects
IRI-herring17-0035	that's the problem
IRI-herring17-0036	and i know i know i have to do i i have to be better about my diet and all that stuff
IRI-herring17-0037	i have to eat healthier
IRI-herring17-0038	i'm actually starting to eat
IRI-herring17-0040	yeah it's genetic because my mom
JAM-herring17-0041	so it's not ah it's not something that was like
JAM-herring17-0043	these these pills
JAM-herring17-0047	i think that they need to consider your ah weight and blood type and stuff
JAM-herring17-0050	when they do a good one ah ah like let's say a costumised ah homeopathic stuff
IRI-herring17-0051	the thing is i went to
JAM-herring17-0052	like if this is generic ah i think it's it's ah still effective
IRI-herring17-0053	it's still effective
IRI-herring17-0055	i know i know
IRI-herring17-0056	i know i need to find i need to find
JAM-herring17-0066	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
IRI-herring17-0067	that's the thing
IRI-herring17-0068	i've been
JAM-herring17-0069	this why that's what i think
IRI-herring17-0070	i've been
JAM-herring17-0071	this this might be even more effective if a real homeopathic doctor like
IRI-herring17-0073	this is all prescribed
IRI-herring17-0074	i i need to go to a good homeopath
IRI-herring17-0075	and the thing is that they're not all of them a lot of them are not covered under regular health insurance
IRI-herring17-0077	so you have to pay the whole
IRI-herring17-0078	you have to pay extra
JAM-herring17-0079	i don't know maybe later ah in a couple of minutes we can check some books there in
IRI-herring17-0080	yeah yes this is also good
JAM-herring17-0081	i was going to say starbucks eh barnes and noble because
IRI-herring17-0082	i'm also
JAM-herring17-0084	there's always ways that you can help yourself
IRI-herring17-0085	that's why i also have that
IRI-herring17-0086	it's a massage oil
JAM-herring17-0092	so you have your kit
JAM-herring17-0097	like herbs and natural components whatever
JAM-herring17-0100	yes
JAM-herring17-0101	it might help
JAM-herring17-0102	but the good stuff is that it's never going to do anything like wrong to you like it's not going to affect you negatively
IRI-herring17-0104	that's why i like it

IRI-herring17-0106	lavender
IRI-herring17-0111	eh
IRI-herring17-0116	they so they dilute
JAM-herring17-0120	so by the way

IRI-herring17-0124	yeah exactly
IRI-herring17-0125	yeah
JAM-herring17-0128	sometimes you can guess that
JAM-herring17-0129	and sometimes you can make it like
JAM-herring17-0130	but dilute it's not how how do you say
JAM-herring17-0138	i don't know
JAM-herring17-0139	it's good that you're doing this stuff

IRI-herring17-0448	i almost fainted no i almost fainted at the at at at ah his place
JAM-herring17-0449	and helpless
JAM-herring17-0450	you have no idea what it is to be actually in that position
JAM-herring17-0451	so i had
JAM-herring17-0452	it happened to me like five times or six
JAM-herring17-0453	and it's
JAM-herring17-0454	oh i hate it
IRI-herring17-0455	no no what i'm trying to tell you is i did not faint
IRI-herring17-0456	but i was this close to fainting because i threw up
JAM-herring17-0457	not the same stuff
IRI-herring17-0458	what if you start to faint
IRI-herring17-0459	i can understand
JAM-herring17-0460	would you would you
JAM-herring17-0461	no you you have no idea
JAM-herring17-0462	when you actually faint when you lose your ah consciousness
IRI-herring17-0464	consciousness
JAM-herring17-0465	you feel like crap
JAM-herring17-0466	it's even worse
JAM-herring17-0467	because i have been in your
IRI-herring17-0468	no no no no no
JAM-herring17-0469	stop
IRI-herring17-0471	oh

IRI-herring17-0482	o k
JAM-herring17-0485	ah i have felt like you like you have like you have felt like ah i'm about to to lose my consciousness
IRI-herring17-0487	yeah
JAM-herring17-0488	and it's terrible
JAM-herring17-0489	it's not nice to be in that position
JAM-herring17-0490	but actually losing the consciousness is worst
IRI-herring17-0491	o k
JAM-herring17-0492	so you do not know that part

JAM-herring17-0496	it's like um a small death
JAM-herring17-0498	something like that
JAM-herring17-0502	so then i have plenty of reasons for not ah i don't know support natural birth
JAM-herring17-0504	it's so unnatural and painful
JAM-herring17-0506	and most likely the person is going to get a loose vagina
JAM-herring17-0508	and even the doctor put the hands inside the vagina to pull the placenta
IRI-herring17-0510	yeah
JAM-herring17-0511	placenta how do you say that
IRI-herring17-0512	yeah yeah

JAM-herring17-0520	placenta
IRI-herring17-0521	yeah
JAM-herring17-0522	o k so so the doctor takes the placenta
JAM-herring17-0524	out of the woman like pulling it with with his own
IRI-herring17-0525	yeah
JAM-herring17-0526	like the whole hand goes inside
JAM-herring17-0527	and it's so barbaric
IRI-herring17-0528	yeah
JAM-herring17-0529	and
JAM-herring17-0530	and it's not just about our myself and my pleasure but about the blood and and

IRI-herring17-0700	yes you told me
JAM-herring17-0701	and i used to be a lot of things
IRI-herring17-0702	so let's let's count them down
JAM-herring17-0703	oh the list is huge
IRI-herring17-0704	i know
IRI-herring17-0705	you told me it was eighteen
JAM-herring17-0708	but not like in the movies like
JAM-herring17-0709	oh my god
JAM-herring17-0711	it's not like a medium like with blank eyes like doing weird stuff
JAM-herring17-0713	just some way to relax and get in touch with a um spirit that eh has some wisdom
IRI-herring17-0714	the the chakras
IRI-herring17-0715	yes
JAM-herring17-0716	not any other spirit
IRI-herring17-0717	aha
JAM-herring17-0718	depends on the medium
IRI-herring17-0719	aha
JAM-herring17-0720	but what happens is that they they they make connection
JAM-herring17-0721	and the spirit speaks about the medium like through the medium
JAM-herring17-0723	and i found it really interesting
JAM-herring17-0726	how do you say that in english
JAM-herring17-0727	like spiritism
IRI-herring17-0728	no er it's called um new age
IRI-herring17-0740	aha
IRI-herring17-0741	aha
IRI-herring17-0744	aha
JAM-herring17-0747	eh and i was looking for eh ah third type encounters
JAM-herring17-0748	how you call those
JAM-herring17-0750	yeah
JAM-herring17-0753	then i became a hare krishna part time
JAM-herring17-0755	a part time hare krishna
IRI-herring17-0756	yeah
JAM-herring17-0757	so i used to be like vegetarian
JAM-herring17-0758	but sometimes i had my my meat
JAM-herring17-0764	and i used to sing with them and stuff like that but just part time
IRI-herring17-0766	oh it was so i
IRI-herring17-0772	aha
IRI-herring17-0774	aha
JAM-herring17-0779	it's like marketing
JAM-herring17-0781	so they sing and they get free food from the market people
JAM-herring17-0783	i don't know
JAM-herring17-0784	they they give away food
JAM-herring17-0785	they prepare the food
JAM-herring17-0786	and if there's a homeless guy or someone they have like meetings
JAM-herring17-0787	and they they they give away people for food
JAM-herring17-0790	but you need to first listen the bhagavad gita
JAM-herring17-0791	and then you get the soup
JAM-herring17-0795	so if you're hungry you can become a hare krishna
JAM-herring17-0796	just get the soup and then get the bhagavad gita and sing with us and dance with us and
JAM-herring17-0798	it's kind of a manipulation
JAM-herring17-0801	it's it's it's it's marketing
JAM-herring17-0802	it's a good way to i don't know give someone a a bowl of soup and some i don't know comfort for the soul
JAM-herring17-0809	o k so it's a mission
JAM-herring17-0810	we give you food
JAM-herring17-0811	and if you want to hear about er jesus christ that's fine
IRI-herring17-0812	you're more than welcome
JAM-herring17-0813	but a couple of centuries ago you do not want to hear about jesus christ so you are going to lose your head
IRI-herring17-0814	i know
JAM-herring17-0815	decapitated
JAM-herring17-0817	yeah but we were counting
JAM-herring17-0818	like hare krishna
JAM-herring17-0820	and i had well my mantras and my stuff
JAM-herring17-0821	hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare
IRI-herring17-0824	aha

JAM-herring17-0867	mm
JAM-herring17-0868	satia saibaba
JAM-herring17-0872	and and then i just read that er i wasn't able to find god or find inner peace
JAM-herring17-0874	so i just eventually stopped looking
JAM-herring17-0875	and i became a rebel
JAM-herring17-0876	and i just told
JAM-herring17-0878	yeah like just told jesus or whatever god or representation there was at that time in my mind
JAM-herring17-0880	it's o k i'm just tired of looking for you
JAM-herring17-0881	and i got nothing
JAM-herring17-0882	i feel nothing
JAM-herring17-0883	i i haven't got any more faith
JAM-herring17-0884	so i'm just going to stop looking
JAM-herring17-0885	if you want to see me just look for me
JAM-herring17-0886	so i'm not going to laughs look for you
JAM-herring17-0888	um i don't know
JAM-herring17-0889	then i became a atheist and then agnostic and plenty of stuff
JAM-herring17-0890	and then i came here to the u s seven years ago
JAM-herring17-0891	and attend like christian meetings and christian churches and stuff
JAM-herring17-0894	and at the end i just realised that i am just a catholic person that wants to be better
JAM-herring17-0895	and er i don't know i'm just trying to be a good man
IRI-herring17-0910	ravers
JAM-herring17-0912	ravers
JAM-herring17-0915	rave music
JAM-herring17-0924	so like techno music
JAM-herring17-0926	isn't that the one that people use to get stoned or get high with these ecstasies
JAM-herring17-0932	i have never tried ecstasies
JAM-herring17-0934	i just smoked marijuana for a couple of years
JAM-herring17-0937	just minor stuff
JAM-herring17-0938	marijuana just
JAM-herring17-0939	but you know what
IRI-herring17-0941	what
JAM-herring17-0942	i i want to try sooner or later in my life at least once l s d
JAM-herring17-0944	at least once
JAM-herring17-0953	it was something natural
JAM-herring17-0955	so then it's not l s d
JAM-herring17-0956	l s d is totally a chemical stuff
JAM-herring17-0959	that has nothing to
JAM-herring17-0960	well l s d l s d is is is er is made in a lab
IRI-herring17-0965	i i
JAM-herring17-0966	so it's some sort of seed that cause the same effect like l s d or something like that
IRI-herring17-0967	yes
IRI-herring17-0968	yes
IRI-herring17-0969	yes
JAM-herring17-0970	but they're some sort of mushrooms or something like that
JAM-herring17-0972	i might try something natural maybe
JAM-herring17-0976	i know about your experience
JAM-herring17-0977	but you know what
JAM-herring17-0978	still
JAM-herring17-0979	i told you the other day
JAM-herring17-0980	er sometimes life is like flat
JAM-herring17-0983	sometimes just being an adult is a little boring
IRI-herring17-0984	yes i know
JAM-herring17-0985	and you can drink sometimes
JAM-herring17-0987	and you feel different
JAM-herring17-0988	could be nice to drink once in a while
JAM-herring17-0990	you can smoke cigarettes which is stupid
JAM-herring17-0992	the worst thing that you can do
JAM-herring17-0993	like marlboro ones
JAM-herring17-0995	you can smoke some marijuana
JAM-herring17-0997	that i used to smoke marijuana
JAM-herring17-0998	and for me it was great
JAM-herring17-1000	um
JAM-herring17-1002	and i experienced nothing wrong about that and nothing
JAM-herring17-1003	but er i never tried any anything else
JAM-herring17-1006	yo sentí cosas que no sentí jamás de otra forma
JAM-herring17-1008	so there wasn't for me any other way to feel what i felt
IRI-herring17-1009	no
JAM-herring17-1010	through marijuana just with marijuana
JAM-herring17-1012	even i i can experience what is love
JAM-herring17-1013	um what it is to drink
JAM-herring17-1014	different things
JAM-herring17-1015	but what marijuana marijuana made me feel nothing else would have made me feel
JAM-herring17-1017	you understand what i'm saying
IRI-herring17-1018	yes completely understand
JAM-herring17-1020	and it's just marijuana for a couple of years
JAM-herring17-1022	so er and i just stopped doing it
JAM-herring17-1024	it was so easy to just not do it i just decided not to do it
JAM-herring17-1025	and i stopped doing it
JAM-herring17-1026	but still i know that there are some ways to feel things in life that just flat main basic emotions are not going to make you feel
IRI-herring17-1027	just like that
JAM-herring17-1028	because i i i might love someone
IRI-herring17-1029	ese es ese es ese es el espíritu santo
JAM-herring17-1030	yeah the holy spirit is nice but er but er ah
JAM-herring17-1034	i do not have faith
IRI-herring17-1035	because
JAM-herring17-1036	i i was not raised to have faith
JAM-herring17-1038	and i have looked for that
JAM-herring17-1039	and i i wanted to have faith but er
JAM-herring17-1041	i'm still a very nice person and i i
JAM-herring17-1042	but you know what
JAM-herring17-1043	i am actually one of the
JAM-herring17-1044	i don't know
JAM-herring17-1045	i consider myself a useful person a nice person that has been doing nice stuff for people all his life
IRI-herring17-1046	yeah
JAM-herring17-1048	i i always have been useful
JAM-herring17-1049	so i'm a good citizen
IRI-herring17-1050	yeah
JAM-herring17-1051	and maybe not really with a big faith
JAM-herring17-1052	but um i have been better than other people that have faith and has done bad stuff
IRI-herring17-1062	aha
JAM-herring17-1066	just give a try once
JAM-herring17-1067	and something that is going to make me feel something different and nice
JAM-herring17-1068	exciting
JAM-herring17-1069	something
JAM-herring17-1070	i don't know er an experience out of myself
JAM-herring17-1071	something
JAM-herring17-1072	and i i have heard that l s d can make you feel like that
IRI-herring17-1073	yeah yeah
IRI-herring17-1074	yeah
JAM-herring17-1075	so just once maybe

OLI-sastre3-0001	the purpose that ah for this meeting today is for um to make ourselves independent from the county as far as the testing ah
LAN-sastre3-0003	ok ok
OLI-sastre3-0004	yeah he was there
MAS-sastre3-0005	um we'll actually he was trying to solve the problem with the
OLI-sastre3-0006	yeah but what's the purpose for the meeting
OLI-sastre3-0007	the purpose for the meeting is to
MAS-sastre3-0008	not independence yet
OLI-sastre3-0009	eventually
MAS-sastre3-0011	we have to be doing little different things to get one report so we can send it downtown so they can you know send it to us
OLI-sastre3-0012	i don't know if you guys know but from um they're gonna start giving us a c j bat test at work
LAN-sastre3-0013	at work
OLI-sastre3-0014	yeah
LAN-sastre3-0015	online
OLI-sastre3-0016	the um the classroom is gonna be set up as a testing area
LAN-sastre3-0017	oh wow
LAN-sastre3-0018	and that's why
OLI-sastre3-0019	and i'm sure you're gonna be involved with that
LAN-sastre3-0020	and why is that
OLI-sastre3-0021	um
MAS-sastre3-0022	we're not really
OLI-sastre3-0023	yes you are
LAN-sastre3-0024	money
OLI-sastre3-0025	no
MAS-sastre3-0026	they only helped us
OLI-sastre3-0027	well but
MAS-sastre3-0028	that had nothing to do with
OLI-sastre3-0029	yeah but does he has to set up the software
MAS-sastre3-0030	no
OLI-sastre3-0031	no that's the system
LAN-sastre3-0032	how about the ok saying is why is they gonna start giving out the tests
LAN-sastre3-0034	ah at the headquarters
LAN-sastre3-0036	ok
MAS-sastre3-0039	you know the scheduling
MAS-sastre3-0040	it's gonna be three times in a week
MAS-sastre3-0041	it's gonna be monday wednesday and friday or something like that or
OLI-sastre3-0042	mhmm
MAS-sastre3-0043	or or morning time
MAS-sastre3-0044	if it's in the afternoon then they do the orientation
OLI-sastre3-0045	they're gonna do orientation
MAS-sastre3-0047	not really
MAS-sastre3-0049	nuhuh
MAS-sastre3-0054	no no
OLI-sastre3-0055	i don't think so
LAN-sastre3-0056	before you
LAN-sastre3-0058	he had
LAN-sastre3-0059	oh ok
MAS-sastre3-0061	whether you apply or not
MAS-sastre3-0064	and you get a p h q
OLI-sastre3-0065	yeah but that makes sense
LAN-sastre3-0066	right
MAS-sastre3-0067	no it doesn't
OLI-sastre3-0068	taking the test first
OLI-sastre3-0069	you don't think so
MAS-sastre3-0070	you apply so you have a statistic of how many people applied
LAN-sastre3-0072	you gonna apply
OLI-sastre3-0076	well
MAS-sastre3-0083	ok
OLI-sastre3-0084	yes or no
MAS-sastre3-0085	what are you gonna do about that
OLI-sastre3-0086	then they have to go and apply
OLI-sastre3-0087	go online
MAS-sastre3-0088	right
MAS-sastre3-0089	but the only problem i see is
MAS-sastre3-0092	why give them a p h q
OLI-sastre3-0093	yeah but that's that's gonna cause a lot of problems
OLI-sastre3-0094	if the people that you're having come in for the c j bat have not applied in that's gonna delay more your procedure
OLI-sastre3-0097	why what but why is it gonna be done like that
OLI-sastre3-0098	why not give them the orientation first
MAS-sastre3-0099	that's what i said
OLI-sastre3-0100	and then the c j bat test in the afternoon if they're interested
OLI-sastre3-0103	i mean doesn't that make more sense right
LAN-sastre3-0105	eh
OLI-sastre3-0106	for them to have the orientation
OLI-sastre3-0107	let them see what it's about
OLI-sastre3-0108	see if they're interested
OLI-sastre3-0110	and if they're not interested they don't come back in the afternoon for their c j bat test
MAS-sastre3-0111	exactly
OLI-sastre3-0118	that was my idea
MAS-sastre3-0119	i've been giving that
MAS-sastre3-0124	and why they can't accept the bat test
OLI-sastre3-0125	oh right right
MAS-sastre3-0128	um like community college and they only have the f bat test taken
MAS-sastre3-0129	they don't the c j bat test and they accepting that
OLI-sastre3-0130	and now they're accepting
OLI-sastre3-0132	but all these are state certified um
MAS-sastre3-0133	they became state certified through the um the university
MAS-sastre3-0145	uh oh
OLI-sastre3-0147	i'm not qualified
MAS-sastre3-0148	i'm not qualified
MAS-sastre3-0149	i'm gonna leave
OLI-sastre3-0151	right
OLI-sastre3-0154	no no no no no
OLI-sastre3-0157	i'll say that to him
OLI-sastre3-0158	that doesn't make sense
MAS-sastre3-0160	i did tell him that
MAS-sastre3-0161	i don't agree with it
MAS-sastre3-0163	because you're gonna spend more money on p h qs giving it out to the people
OLI-sastre3-0166	it's gonna go in the garbage
MAS-sastre3-0167	right
OLI-sastre3-0168	and you're gonna get people that after they take the test are gonna say
OLI-sastre3-0169	oh this isn't for me
OLI-sastre3-0172	once they hear the orientation
OLI-sastre3-0174	no that doesn't make sense
MAS-sastre3-0178	three times and within the year
OLI-sastre3-0179	and how much does
MAS-sastre3-0180	and different versions
OLI-sastre3-0181	listen
OLI-sastre3-0182	that test how much does it cost us
MAS-sastre3-0183	nine dollars
OLI-sastre3-0184	a person
OLI-sastre3-0185	ok so once again why would you have the person spend the money you know why should we spend nine dollars for somebody that after you have the orientation might not even be interested in the position
OLI-sastre3-0190	that's not cost effective
MAS-sastre3-0191	numbered that's what they want
MAS-sastre3-0195	no
OLI-sastre3-0197	boy i i would have gotten into a good argument with him with that if i would have known that
MAS-sastre3-0198	you're not gonna win it
MAS-sastre3-0199	you're not gonna win it
OLI-sastre3-0212	what did you say landon
OLI-sastre3-0213	what are they gonna do
MAS-sastre3-0214	freeze it
LAN-sastre3-0215	ah nothing
LAN-sastre3-0217	budget
LAN-sastre3-0219	budget cuts
OLI-sastre3-0222	things are bad
LAN-sastre3-0223	uhhuh
MAS-sastre3-0224	wow
MAS-sastre3-0225	so you had the the the summer off
OLI-sastre3-0226	oh my god
LAN-sastre3-0227	yeah
MAS-sastre3-0228	wow
LAN-sastre3-0229	incredible
LAN-sastre3-0231	that happened to me when i was about to graduate um we have that class they weren't they were not teaching the class doing that semesters
LAN-sastre3-0234	so that i had to wait because we didn't have enough people
OLI-sastre3-0237	but that makes sense i mean you know
OLI-sastre3-0239	it makes sense because we're the ones that deal with it
OLI-sastre3-0240	and we know what you go through you know
MAS-sastre3-0241	of course
OLI-sastre3-0249	ah the larger the file the more time it's gonna take you to do everything that you have to do
LAN-sastre3-0251	why
MAS-sastre3-0252	they're gonna do it now
OLI-sastre3-0255	yeah they're gonna have a job opening for every month
OLI-sastre3-0257	three hundred
MAS-sastre3-0258	five hundred four hundred something like that
MAS-sastre3-0259	not that many
OLI-sastre3-0260	i don't think you'll have that many
OLI-sastre3-0261	five hundred people
MAS-sastre3-0262	yeah it could be
MAS-sastre3-0263	it could be
MAS-sastre3-0264	by now i have two hundred
MAS-sastre3-0265	i had two hundred this morning before i scheduled them two weeks period
MAS-sastre3-0266	in a two week period
MAS-sastre3-0269	it's not just saying that you have three thousand
MAS-sastre3-0270	like like right now i have three thousand nine hundred people applicants on a list than having five hundred only that you can scroll down and and and choose from that
LAN-sastre3-0271	why
MAS-sastre3-0272	so that's why that's why i thought it um it was better for us
MAS-sastre3-0273	well actually it was better for me because i'm the one who works with the program
OLI-sastre3-0283	ok
MAS-sastre3-0284	because i'm gonna be doing
OLI-sastre3-0285	you know why because you know why because i was told to teach daniela everything i do
MAS-sastre3-0286	i'm gonna i'm gonna be doing testing
OLI-sastre3-0287	i'm trying to put two and two
MAS-sastre3-0288	right
MAS-sastre3-0289	oh no no
OLI-sastre3-0290	together
MAS-sastre3-0291	the forget it
MAS-sastre3-0292	it's not that's not the way it works
MAS-sastre3-0293	the counting doesn't work that way

OLI-sastre3-0408	thank you
OLI-sastre3-0413	i i'm gonna smell like a fried ah chicken
OLI-sastre3-0417	positive
MAS-sastre3-0418	no
MAS-sastre3-0420	worse
MAS-sastre3-0421	it's been worse
MAS-sastre3-0422	we had more applicants before than now
MAS-sastre3-0424	right
MAS-sastre3-0425	some of them don't even have email so they they don't have a computer so they have to go to the library or friends house
OLI-sastre3-0426	some people have to do an application three times before they can get it correctly
MAS-sastre3-0427	uhhuh
OLI-sastre3-0428	before it can go through the whole screening and downtown screens them and everything sometimes three times they have to do it
LAN-sastre3-0429	wow
MAS-sastre3-0430	yeah yeah
OLI-sastre3-0431	thank you
OLI-sastre3-0434	no but listen listen mason
LAN-sastre3-0438	ok
MAS-sastre3-0440	i'm expecting you know a response right away
MAS-sastre3-0441	you know and and the way it's going now is
LAN-sastre3-0442	the application is going in too slow
MAS-sastre3-0443	is running running too slow
OLI-sastre3-0444	you know what was funny here in this meeting
OLI-sastre3-0445	there's this man sitting next to me from t e t s c
OLI-sastre3-0446	very he's like very intelligent you know
OLI-sastre3-0447	and um he he gives us this whole presentation in paper with diagrams and with ah pictures and
OLI-sastre3-0449	i i mean like nice presentation
OLI-sastre3-0450	well the lieutenant took over the presentation from the beginning to the end like if he had done the presentation
OLI-sastre3-0452	it was incredible
OLI-sastre3-0453	the guy didn't say almost i mean i think that if he said four words
MAS-sastre3-0454	but that's what the what i'm telling you
MAS-sastre3-0455	that's the problem with the lieutenant
MAS-sastre3-0456	he does not let you speak and put your your your senses into the into a meeting
OLI-sastre3-0457	yeah but
MAS-sastre3-0459	yeah yeah and he spent like maybe months doing this
MAS-sastre3-0460	that's what
OLI-sastre3-0461	and the rest of the stuff
OLI-sastre3-0462	he put it all in writing for us and everything
MAS-sastre3-0465	and and
OLI-sastre3-0466	yes
MAS-sastre3-0467	he knew what he was talking about
OLI-sastre3-0468	yeah he did
MAS-sastre3-0469	but the guy was had more to say about
MAS-sastre3-0470	because he's the one who who prepared
MAS-sastre3-0471	and he has also other another form that he he actually a presentation
MAS-sastre3-0475	that we never went through the whole thing
MAS-sastre3-0476	we just skipped pages and skipped pages you know
OLI-sastre3-0477	we were laughing about it now in the car
OLI-sastre3-0489	yes
OLI-sastre3-0490	no but you know what got me
OLI-sastre3-0491	that he wasn't aware of all the problems that you were going through
MAS-sastre3-0492	right
OLI-sastre3-0493	everything that you were doing he had no idea
MAS-sastre3-0494	but see that's the problem lack of communication
MAS-sastre3-0497	no mason is the one that works with this
MAS-sastre3-0498	let's take them downtown and show them what he needs and how he does this so they can understand what's our problem
MAS-sastre3-0502	right
OLI-sastre3-0503	but you know i think that the bottom line is that because we're just one department that's having this problem the county is not gonna change the whole frigging system for us
OLI-sastre3-0504	you know what i'm saying
OLI-sastre3-0506	no way
OLI-sastre3-0510	oh did i say a bad word
OLI-sastre3-0512	i mean really
OLI-sastre3-0513	that's how they look at it
OLI-sastre3-0514	they're not gonna change the system for us
OLI-sastre3-0515	well because of the type of position that it is ok you have to keep um tracking it for everything
OLI-sastre3-0516	mhmm
MAS-sastre3-0519	for example
MAS-sastre3-0521	drink water drink water
OLI-sastre3-0523	oh my god what color was it
LAN-sastre3-0524	it was green like a pepper
OLI-sastre3-0526	uh oh
MAS-sastre3-0528	anyhow the um so they hired one position for
MAS-sastre3-0530	and there's they say ah maybe a hundred people apply for the position of secretary
MAS-sastre3-0531	so they screened the hundred
MAS-sastre3-0532	and whoever qualifies for it they will pick out and interview them
MAS-sastre3-0533	in our case no
MAS-sastre3-0534	if you have a position that continues a position like police officer everybody applies to it
MAS-sastre3-0535	and everybody has to rescreen
MAS-sastre3-0536	and everybody's scheduled to take a test
MAS-sastre3-0537	so that's the difference
OLI-sastre3-0538	and that's not the only test that police officers take
OLI-sastre3-0539	they do the polygraph
OLI-sastre3-0540	the they do the the what the medical stuff
OLI-sastre3-0541	what's the other thing that they do
MAS-sastre3-0542	psychological
MAS-sastre3-0544	assessment's gonna be taken away now
OLI-sastre3-0545	really
MAS-sastre3-0546	yeah
OLI-sastre3-0547	you mean they're not gonna do it at all
OLI-sastre3-0548	or somebody else is gonna do it
MAS-sastre3-0549	they're not gonna do it
MAS-sastre3-0550	because since they gonna do it in the academy why have them do it twice
OLI-sastre3-0551	oh like part of the training or something
MAS-sastre3-0552	right
OLI-sastre3-0553	do they get support for that now when they do it
OLI-sastre3-0554	so this is better for them then
MAS-sastre3-0555	mhmm
MAS-sastre3-0556	right
MAS-sastre3-0557	yeah
MAS-sastre3-0558	well if you if you look at it it's more like um maybe more like you think about it
MAS-sastre3-0559	how will you handle this
MAS-sastre3-0560	you know will you ignore this person
LAN-sastre3-0561	they're testing your skills
MAS-sastre3-0562	or will you
OLI-sastre3-0563	no
MAS-sastre3-0564	how about attitude
MAS-sastre3-0565	will you you assume
OLI-sastre3-0566	i think they're testing for common sense or your common sense
LAN-sastre3-0567	they're testing your skills
MAS-sastre3-0568	yeah your skills yeah
OLI-sastre3-0569	how you're you know how would you react to different situations you know
LAN-sastre3-0571	in front of a situation
OLI-sastre3-0572	yeah
OLI-sastre3-0573	do people actually fail that
MAS-sastre3-0574	of course
OLI-sastre3-0575	they do
MAS-sastre3-0576	yeah
MAS-sastre3-0577	the assessment not a lot
MAS-sastre3-0578	but you have some you know a percentage that that do fail
OLI-sastre3-0579	i think they should definitely also implement the fact that they should be able to see their c j bat scores
OLI-sastre3-0580	or maybe automatically when they finish with the c j bat test an email gets sent to them saying
OLI-sastre3-0581	you got a seventy
OLI-sastre3-0582	you got a whatever
MAS-sastre3-0583	now ah well not not now
OLI-sastre3-0584	now no
OLI-sastre3-0585	not with the police officer position
OLI-sastre3-0586	with police complaint officer and police dispatcher they do
OLI-sastre3-0587	you can actually go into um miami day dot gov and to the testing site
OLI-sastre3-0588	and it'll tell you pass or fail
OLI-sastre3-0589	it's not gonna tell you your score though
OLI-sastre3-0590	but that's because
OLI-sastre3-0592	the county is the one that sets up those appointments
OLI-sastre3-0595	that's why ours don't they can't be seen
OLI-sastre3-0601	oh my god
MAS-sastre3-0613	crabs
OLI-sastre3-0616	oh
LAN-sastre3-0617	crabs
OLI-sastre3-0619	no
OLI-sastre3-0621	that must that must be a puertorican word

MAS-sastre3-0669	no you eat it with the shell in the shell
MAS-sastre3-0670	you know you just with a fork you know you take it out
MAS-sastre3-0673	but you have to open it from the bottom
OLI-sastre3-0674	mhmm
OLI-sastre3-0684	what's the word that i wanna use
OLI-sastre3-0685	florentino
MAS-sastre3-0686	florentino florentino

MEL-herring8-0120	i don't know if i told you that
MEL-herring8-0121	and i just didn't respond
MEL-herring8-0122	and i told gloria because
ROB-herring8-0123	sunshine
MEL-herring8-0124	hundred percent if she's not gonna give herself a hundred percent
MEL-herring8-0125	it's not worth it
MEL-herring8-0126	i have enough to do
MEL-herring8-0127	i've to work on the fricking formatting crap
ROB-herring8-0128	sunshine be careful
MEL-herring8-0129	it was very minor what they told me i had to change
ROB-herring8-0130	what
MEL-herring8-0131	centering a page
ROB-herring8-0133	but you see what i'm saying is they should not give you because they've asked you to format a thousand different ways
ROB-herring8-0134	they should have one person at the end of the process once everything's approved um doing the formatting
ROB-herring8-0135	o k you need to change this and this
MEL-herring8-0136	what that's what the college
ROB-herring8-0137	so should have one person in charge of of formatting
MEL-herring8-0138	in the college of education they hire mrs dr blap to do that
MEL-herring8-0139	but they submitted my dissertation with those formatting issues because they knew that it would still pass for the defense
MEL-herring8-0140	some of the catches she didn't catch
MEL-herring8-0141	and she caught things that they didn't catch
ROB-herring8-0143	i was looking today
MEL-herring8-0146	oh
ROB-herring8-0147	was outside talking on the phone
ROB-herring8-0149	and i was watching this from rosa's bedroom
ROB-herring8-0150	and uh i would see that she would be looking at them and talking on the phone and
ROB-herring8-0151	they would catch passes in front of her
ROB-herring8-0152	when have they ever decided to play football here
MEL-herring8-0153	two weeks ago
MEL-herring8-0154	when we had the music playing

ROB-herring8-0165	when i was a kid you know we used to do
ROB-herring8-0166	we used to get the hose and drink from the hose

MEL-herring8-0178	and why do the why does it have to be grass here
ROB-herring8-0179	i like it grass
ROB-herring8-0180	what else would you recommend
MEL-herring8-0181	pebbles mulch

ROB-herring8-0183	i have two bags of mulch i can lay
MEL-herring8-0185	look it it it the shade is completely covering it

ROB-herring8-0211	sunshine get away from that cactus
ROB-herring8-0212	ah
MEL-herring8-0213	i thought was just gonna be me and rosa
MEL-herring8-0214	and i even told rosa i was gonna get there at tennish
MEL-herring8-0216	and and that's it
MEL-herring8-0217	go in f i u
MEL-herring8-0218	and picking up the thing
MEL-herring8-0219	there's no traffic
ROB-herring8-0220	was she there before you
MEL-herring8-0221	no but susie was
ROB-herring8-0222	no i'm saying susie
MEL-herring8-0223	susie was yeah when i got in the door was unlocked and how weird
ROB-herring8-0224	but wasn't she supposed to be out
MEL-herring8-0225	i thought everybody was gonna be out today
MEL-herring8-0226	that's what i had heard that everybody was out
MEL-herring8-0229	which is fine
MEL-herring8-0230	we made a lot of progress
MEL-herring8-0232	all day
MEL-herring8-0233	the morning was getting ready for the meeting
MEL-herring8-0234	basically it was c c's integrates
MEL-herring8-0235	i gave her the ideas
ROB-herring8-0237	modified them
MEL-herring8-0238	complicated them
ROB-herring8-0239	she c c ed them
MEL-herring8-0240	if that means complicate then yeah
MEL-herring8-0241	you know these are meant to be for teacher assistants and they're supposed to be non threatening low prep you know emphasizing
MEL-herring8-0242	and i had told her you know do something on conservation because there's water
MEL-herring8-0243	i given her
MEL-herring8-0244	long story short it was very complicated so
MEL-herring8-0245	i had already gone through them because supposedly that's what i was gonna do yesterday
MEL-herring8-0246	so then in the morning i went through them i made copies of everything and then i also gave
MEL-herring8-0247	for example one of the reviewers had recommended a book in the lesson of displacement where the water is displaced
MEL-herring8-0249	uh called the crow and the pitcher
MEL-herring8-0250	it's an aesop fable
ROB-herring8-0251	aesop
ROB-herring8-0254	aesop
MEL-herring8-0255	a e s o p
ROB-herring8-0256	aesop
MEL-herring8-0257	it has an a
ROB-herring8-0258	aesop's fables
MEL-herring8-0259	a aesop
ROB-herring8-0260	aesop's fable
MEL-herring8-0261	you know the crow and the pitcher
MEL-herring8-0262	anyway it has to do with a crow who wants to get uh drink some water from a pitcher
MEL-herring8-0263	but his beak doesn't go inside
MEL-herring8-0264	so he needs putting little stones in until the water rises enough he can drink it
MEL-herring8-0265	and the thing is using your wit to get whatever
MEL-herring8-0266	but it's a lesson on displacement which is exactly the second lesson
MEL-herring8-0267	ruby used it
MEL-herring8-0268	so i showed
ROB-herring8-0269	and you went to work with those shoes
MEL-herring8-0270	i thought i was alone
ROB-herring8-0271	and did she say anything
MEL-herring8-0273	they're cute

MAR-maria4-0023	you look like a balloon in a ski slope the the sunglasses the sweater the jacket
MAR-maria4-0024	like i don't live in the u k
MAR-maria4-0025	yes
MAR-maria4-0026	um
MAR-maria4-0027	dating moon or anything
MAR-maria4-0028	not a single comment came back from from them
MAR-maria4-0029	there wasn't a single comment so i can only assume that the their a they were o k with the b with they needed them so it's nice to have them
MAR-maria4-0030	i don't know
MAR-maria4-0031	we don't need him
MAR-maria4-0032	he is correct
MAR-maria4-0033	and i have told him to take them out
MAR-maria4-0034	and i took them out
MAR-maria4-0035	buy i may have taken it out of r drawing not out of w
MAR-maria4-0036	we don't need him
MAR-maria4-0037	my
MAR-maria4-0039	they are probably change those on the architectural way u and b
MAR-maria4-0040	but double u had already been issued or what have you told
MAR-maria4-0041	it probably never got picked up
MAR-maria4-0042	they they aren't the the b c c
MAR-maria4-0043	yeah
MAR-maria4-0044	we can do a trade
MAR-maria4-0045	right right
MAR-maria4-0046	i don't think is that much of a
MAR-maria4-0047	difficult
MAR-maria4-0049	like rodríguez or garcía
MAR-maria4-0050	was was striker then
MAR-maria4-0051	striker then ask for too much
MAR-maria4-0052	there is
MAR-maria4-0053	this is how much it is
MAR-maria4-0054	but you have to say this is
MAR-maria4-0055	right
MAR-maria4-0056	right right right right
MAR-maria4-0057	well actually what it was claimed in my emails
MAR-maria4-0058	i picked up a few items
MAR-maria4-0059	uh that he is charging for
MAR-maria4-0060	they let me ask you a question
MAR-maria4-0061	and you may have been already on w
MAR-maria4-0062	the insta hots that are down below
MAR-maria4-0063	he claimed that then we told them to move up a u
MAR-maria4-0064	is that true
MAR-maria4-0065	first we were never included
MAR-maria4-0066	they may put them down here and they were settled
MAR-maria4-0067	the width is for a panel
MAR-maria4-0068	what we had what the guy just made made a panel to cover that
MAR-maria4-0069	but i have a picture like defoes
MAR-maria4-0070	no
MAR-maria4-0071	this is why they need spaces in the dressing webs
MAR-maria4-0072	because that's the only ones that you see
MAR-maria4-0073	and defoe sent a picture and it clearly shows the insta hot under the sink
MAR-maria4-0074	but i need to go look to see what my discussion with garcía was in terms of what they extra money
MAR-maria4-0075	and i think they said that yes they had put him there and then they had to move him to the top
MAR-maria4-0076	and i am like wait a minute i got a picture
MAR-maria4-0077	i gotta figure out whether it's a or u
MAR-maria4-0078	i don't know which one of this
MAR-maria4-0079	well i mean just to check
MAR-maria4-0080	miguel i saw penélope

MAR-maria4-0158	we ha we don't ever get it in the right sun so

MAR-maria4-0160	where you go
MAR-maria4-0161	i'm heading back my way

MAR-maria4-0182	the heel is like ten inches
MAR-maria4-0183	look at those things
MAR-maria4-0184	no no
MAR-maria4-0185	that's more than five
MAR-maria4-0187	cause i think it's what we had
MAR-maria4-0188	and they cannot imitate it
MAR-maria4-0189	what we had in the other schools
MAR-maria4-0190	no
MAR-maria4-0191	eh it was a camera
MAR-maria4-0192	it was a camera
MAR-maria4-0193	but they had to add here was a was a c c t v thing
MAR-maria4-0194	yeah i think so too
MAR-maria4-0195	one here
MAR-maria4-0196	that is excessive down below
MAR-maria4-0197	you need one more exit up here
MAR-maria4-0198	and you will need so many over
MAR-maria4-0199	and you will need so many over here
MAR-maria4-0200	oh i know we went through all this with with uh
MAR-maria4-0201	the uh a and u and v
MAR-maria4-0202	and he may have just copied it in you know
MAR-maria4-0203	right
MAR-maria4-0204	one of the projects
MAR-maria4-0205	right
MAR-maria4-0206	but if they're not going to put any doors at all then you don't need an exit time
MAR-maria4-0207	it's just and opening
MAR-maria4-0208	why would you
MAR-maria4-0209	why
MAR-maria4-0210	because it's cold over here
MAR-maria4-0211	you think he's stupid
MAR-maria4-0212	that's fine
MAR-maria4-0213	i don't even think they
MAR-maria4-0214	did they buy any r a u and v
MAR-maria4-0215	i've never seen the box
MAR-maria4-0216	that's right
MAR-maria4-0217	that's right
MAR-maria4-0218	right
MAR-maria4-0219	right right
MAR-maria4-0220	i think that's what they did
MAR-maria4-0221	i think that's what they did
MAR-maria4-0222	i think that's what they did
MAR-maria4-0223	but our
MAR-maria4-0224	no
MAR-maria4-0225	right
MAR-maria4-0226	yeah
MAR-maria4-0227	i think you i think you do
MAR-maria4-0228	personally
MAR-maria4-0229	where else
MAR-maria4-0230	yeah well
MAR-maria4-0231	no he didn't
MAR-maria4-0232	no he didn't
MAR-maria4-0233	has anybody complained
MAR-maria4-0234	we i think he just forgot about it
MAR-maria4-0235	we gave him for here
MAR-maria4-0236	we told him that there's a way to this back here
MAR-maria4-0237	the school all schools says there were interested in this one
MAR-maria4-0238	they they could care less about this one
MAR-maria4-0239	particularly when you have a fence
MAR-maria4-0240	and we need to we need to make sure we have a way to fence just like we did in the u v
MAR-maria4-0241	a way to close this
MAR-maria4-0242	in other words the entrance here is a little bit different
MAR-maria4-0243	you know what i'm saying right
MAR-maria4-0244	that r a u and v we
MAR-maria4-0245	right
MAR-maria4-0246	they need to be able to to
MAR-maria4-0247	because visitors are parking here
MAR-maria4-0248	and they could theoretically sneak in back here
MAR-maria4-0249	the layout is a little bit different here
MAR-maria4-0250	cause there are u and v the
MAR-maria4-0251	we may have those
MAR-maria4-0252	we may have to find we may have to find a different
MAR-maria4-0253	mm
MAR-maria4-0254	for the f b o
MAR-maria4-0255	but
MAR-maria4-0256	it's better
MAR-maria4-0258	right
MAR-maria4-0259	this is where the tank is
MAR-maria4-0260	is it
MAR-maria4-0261	that's supposed to be the
MAR-maria4-0262	this is where the tank for the the eh gas is
MAR-maria4-0263	so what's that
MAR-maria4-0264	oh they haven't updated the drawings
MAR-maria4-0265	o k
MAR-maria4-0266	o k
MAR-maria4-0267	i oops
MAR-maria4-0268	oops
MAR-maria4-0269	yeah that's fine
MAR-maria4-0270	oh the be here
MAR-maria4-0271	some
MAR-maria4-0272	and then how would they access
MAR-maria4-0274	oh there'd still be a gate o k
MAR-maria4-0275	split it in that
MAR-maria4-0276	it's a good idea
MAR-maria4-0277	that's a good idea
MAR-maria4-0278	cause it at least hides it
MAR-maria4-0279	cause those things are uglier so
MAR-maria4-0280	that's a good idea
MAR-maria4-0281	yeah right that
MAR-maria4-0282	it's a good idea
MAR-maria4-0283	uh see
MAR-maria4-0284	what is this thing called again

JES-herring6-0184	gordo is sick too
NIC-herring6-0186	i don't know how many times he kicked me in the bed
JES-herring6-0187	no
JES-herring6-0188	i don't remember him kicking me
JES-herring6-0189	so he must have been facing me the whole time
NIC-herring6-0190	no it was me
NIC-herring6-0191	it was me
NIC-herring6-0192	he was kicking me the whole time
NIC-herring6-0193	i didn't sleep very well either
NIC-herring6-0194	i was waking up at three and at four and at five
JES-herring6-0195	i slept pretty well
NIC-herring6-0196	yeah i know you did
NIC-herring6-0197	you were snoring
JES-herring6-0198	yeah i must have slept well
NIC-herring6-0199	and quite loud i might add
NIC-herring6-0200	and paco was snoaring really loud too
NIC-herring6-0201	so anyway
NIC-herring6-0202	i'm gonna go drop that off at the motor home when i leave for the parish
JES-herring6-0204	um yesterday the principle called me in
JES-herring6-0206	she goes
JES-herring6-0207	i wanna talk to you before i i speak to that teacher
NIC-herring6-0208	the one that has that problem
JES-herring6-0209	yes
JES-herring6-0210	and um and i go um
JES-herring6-0211	i wanna
NIC-herring6-0212	she goes to me
JES-herring6-0213	i wanna speak to you before i talk to her because i want the union to be ok with this
JES-herring6-0214	and uh and i go
JES-herring6-0215	ok
JES-herring6-0216	and so i go to her
JES-herring6-0217	yeah well you know let me know about about what's going on
JES-herring6-0218	and she goes
JES-herring6-0219	no i'm telling you what i'm planning to do because you know when when she comes in she's probably gonna be upset or whatever
JES-herring6-0220	she might come to you
NIC-herring6-0221	oh because she's coming back to work
JES-herring6-0222	ok
JES-herring6-0223	she came back to work
JES-herring6-0224	she came back to work
JES-herring6-0225	yeah you know i was mentioning that you know people talk about the catholic church and how um priests that molest children like get transfered
NIC-herring6-0226	just get transfered from one place to another and the school system is doing the same thing
JES-herring6-0227	but but the school system is about just about the same category then
JES-herring6-0228	because her dad is an attorney and her brother is an attorney
JES-herring6-0229	so they're more scared of the lawsuit than they are of ethical things
NIC-herring6-0230	right they're more scared of the lawsuit from her the employee than the lawsuit from the parents
JES-herring6-0231	yeah
JES-herring6-0232	because the the parents didn't do anything but the parents are more concerned and took them out took the kids out
JES-herring6-0233	imagine that's a free program
JES-herring6-0234	you know and so anyhow um she goes
JES-herring6-0235	she had come to me the principle had come to me a couple days ago and she goes um
JES-herring6-0236	the person that you sent me an email and the resume do you know them personally
JES-herring6-0237	and i go
JES-herring6-0238	truthfully no
JES-herring6-0239	i know her boyfriend
JES-herring6-0240	um i know her via email but you know because you know we've gone back and forth
JES-herring6-0241	then she is in a position where she wants to
NIC-herring6-0242	who's this
JES-herring6-0244	the manager of payway
NIC-herring6-0245	oh ok yeah
JES-herring6-0246	but he but he
NIC-herring6-0247	right right right that she was in that school in
JES-herring6-0248	she's in belair
JES-herring6-0249	she's in belair
JES-herring6-0250	she's in fifth grade
JES-herring6-0251	e s e
JES-herring6-0252	well that's exactly what she needs over here
NIC-herring6-0255	so then tell them that they have to leave again
JES-herring6-0256	no no
JES-herring6-0257	because she's been working there less than three years
JES-herring6-0258	she has to get that approved
JES-herring6-0259	she you know it's the bureaucracy
JES-herring6-0260	it takes a while
JES-herring6-0261	so she goes um
JES-herring6-0262	i need the person that i have up there now
JES-herring6-0264	you know i mean i need to get rid of them
JES-herring6-0265	and um i need to bring in somebody else
JES-herring6-0266	but with that other person they're already in the system
JES-herring6-0267	so it's gonna take a long return
JES-herring6-0268	even though they're in the system they're somewhere else so it has to get approved by the district the the the change
JES-herring6-0269	even if
NIC-herring6-0270	even the principals and stuff right
JES-herring6-0271	the principal
JES-herring6-0273	you you remember what i went through ok
JES-herring6-0274	and so she goes
JES-herring6-0275	because i had told her if she comes back what we need to do is don't put her in don't put her in that classroom put her in a higher grade you know where kids can talk and kids can talk and kids can tell you exactly what's going on
JES-herring6-0276	and so she goes
JES-herring6-0277	yeah but i think she's only certified for pre k
JES-herring6-0280	no but i need i looked up her her stuff
JES-herring6-0281	and she is k through six pre k and k through six elementary
JES-herring6-0282	well perfect
JES-herring6-0283	and she is emotionally
NIC-herring6-0284	put her put her with six grades six grades
JES-herring6-0285	no no we don't have six grade
NIC-herring6-0286	oh that's right
JES-herring6-0287	fifth grade
NIC-herring6-0288	put her put her with fifth grade students
JES-herring6-0289	they will eat her alive
NIC-herring6-0290	then she'll leave
JES-herring6-0294	she goes
JES-herring6-0295	i go no
JES-herring6-0303	you know
JES-herring6-0306	she's great
JES-herring6-0307	but she's new
JES-herring6-0309	she goes
JES-herring6-0310	she asks people
JES-herring6-0311	you know er the person that gave her the position or whatever
JES-herring6-0312	and told her
JES-herring6-0313	listen look at what she's you know certified in
JES-herring6-0314	because that's what that's the first thing i had asked her
JES-herring6-0315	what is she certified in
JES-herring6-0316	put her somewhere else
JES-herring6-0317	but i guess she hadn't really done any until she you know somebody told her how to do it
JES-herring6-0322	eh she has every right to do so
JES-herring6-0324	whether i like it or not that's i mean they should take that into consideration
JES-herring6-0325	but they don't have to
NIC-herring6-0326	but at any rate didn't they get somebody to replace her while she was gone
JES-herring6-0327	they had a sub
NIC-herring6-0328	and so what happened when this woman came back
JES-herring6-0329	well she requested not to have the people that you know made the allegations in the classroom
JES-herring6-0330	and she said
JES-herring6-0331	look i've nowhere else to put them
JES-herring6-0332	so she obviously felt very uncomfortable working there
NIC-herring6-0333	good
JES-herring6-0342	oh yeah
JES-herring6-0343	they're emotionally you know disabled
JES-herring6-0346	e s e is really really really difficult
JES-herring6-0351	like a c s t it's like a it's it's a child study team
JES-herring6-0352	so she was meeting with some parents and a counselor whatever
JES-herring6-0353	so she wasn't in the classroom
JES-herring6-0362	how could this child just walk out
JES-herring6-0364	the child snuck out
NIC-herring6-0365	but this is from your school
JES-herring6-0366	yeah from her class
NIC-herring6-0367	where are you going
NIC-herring6-0368	ok hurry up because i don't want you to leave your brother out there alone
JES-herring6-0369	and um the the child snuck out
JES-herring6-0370	so she the principal went in there to try to see how could this happen and how to prevent it from happening again
JES-herring6-0373	around the park people walk around
JES-herring6-0376	because it was nap time
JES-herring6-0384	i went in there
JES-herring6-0385	i was talking to the aids
JES-herring6-0387	i know she was in a meeting during that time
JES-herring6-0388	she goes
JES-herring6-0389	yeah but it's her classroom
JES-herring6-0391	she was
NIC-herring6-0395	so she doesn't she doesn't give a damn about the kids
JES-herring6-0396	no she doesn't
JES-herring6-0397	of course she doesn't
JES-herring6-0407	she doesn't have plans
JES-herring6-0416	donde podemos estar
JES-herring6-0420	nos van a botar para el carajo
JES-herring6-0421	she was
NIC-herring6-0426	absolutely
JES-herring6-0429	so i'm going by the contract
NIC-herring6-0436	yeah
NIC-herring6-0438	i think katie is gonna start in a school in june
JES-herring6-0439	she already resigned
NIC-herring6-0440	well i don't know if she's resigned
NIC-herring6-0441	but she hasn't signed the contract yet
JES-herring6-0442	then she hasn't resigned
NIC-herring6-0443	but um i think they started calling people down to sign their contracts on thursday
NIC-herring6-0445	i mean not thursday yesterday
NIC-herring6-0446	yesterday was wednesday
NIC-herring6-0447	but yeah yesterday
NIC-herring6-0448	no yesterday was thursday
JES-herring6-0449	yes
NIC-herring6-0450	no wednesday
NIC-herring6-0451	i'm sorry
NIC-herring6-0452	they started calling um people down
NIC-herring6-0453	so i imagine that they'll be calling her soon to go sign her contract
NIC-herring6-0454	and then the nun said that er to see if she could be coming in you know at some point maybe for like a week or something
NIC-herring6-0455	just to see how things are
NIC-herring6-0456	and then and then probably start in june to try and get the
NIC-herring6-0459	it may be better for her not to
JES-herring6-0460	for you and for her
NIC-herring6-0464	they are gonna come to me
JES-herring6-0465	right
JES-herring6-0466	so
NIC-herring6-0474	what i told her is
NIC-herring6-0475	get your certification
JES-herring6-0476	exactly
NIC-herring6-0477	in social studies so that you can work at at a public school
NIC-herring6-0478	and then she told me
NIC-herring6-0479	no janet was saying that in ferguson there is gonna be openings for six new teachers in every department
NIC-herring6-0480	and i go
NIC-herring6-0481	well there is your entry right there
JES-herring6-0482	exactly
NIC-herring6-0483	you know
JES-herring6-0484	there's always openings in
NIC-herring6-0485	and she said
NIC-herring6-0486	yeah but you know i don't wanna work in public schools
NIC-herring6-0487	and i go
NIC-herring6-0488	well you know what
NIC-herring6-0489	if you work in a public school you are gonna make more money than what i'm making right now
NIC-herring6-0490	ok
NIC-herring6-0491	and i said
NIC-herring6-0492	so go ahead
NIC-herring6-0493	and start doing that
NIC-herring6-0494	and the only way you are gonna get fired is if you do something to one of the kids
JES-herring6-0495	but yes unless you have during the first thirty days or first day they have the option to you know if they see that you you are really bad they can throw you out
NIC-herring6-0496	come on
JES-herring6-0497	within the first thirty days
NIC-herring6-0499	he's such a jerk
JES-herring6-0500	it was a teacher
JES-herring6-0501	yeah i know
NIC-herring6-0502	i can't stand him
JES-herring6-0503	that there was a teacher
JES-herring6-0505	that they had you know done a whole bunch of things
JES-herring6-0507	i know exactly who they were talking about from you know from the school i was at before
JES-herring6-0509	and i go
JES-herring6-0510	did you get hired somewhere else
JES-herring6-0514	are you sick
JES-herring6-0515	are you sick
JES-herring6-0516	and if they were sick and they were out they would ask them
JES-herring6-0517	what did you have
JES-herring6-0518	oh no i you know i i had you know a stomach virus
JES-herring6-0519	oh a stomach virus ok
JES-herring6-0520	she would come back and say
JES-herring6-0521	no she's sick
JES-herring6-0522	and she goes she she would er ask for worker's compensation because she got the stomach virus from a kid in the class
NIC-herring6-0523	how do people like that get jobs
JES-herring6-0525	that's not the worse
NIC-herring6-0528	oh that's the one that you caught going through your desk over here
JES-herring6-0529	yeah no not here
NIC-herring6-0530	at at at the other one
JES-herring6-0531	at the over right
JES-herring6-0532	right right right
NIC-herring6-0538	that's just amazing to me
JES-herring6-0540	ok
NIC-herring6-0547	that's the thing that's the thing with my school since we work on contract
NIC-herring6-0548	you break your contract you're out
JES-herring6-0549	they have to
JES-herring6-0550	here they give you the opportunity to put you on a a an an improvement plan
JES-herring6-0551	and if you don't improve then it takes a long time
NIC-herring6-0552	no no i mean here they you know we try to help you out
JES-herring6-0553	a lot of bureaucracy
NIC-herring6-0554	you know we'll put a mentor
NIC-herring6-0555	we'll give you ideas
NIC-herring6-0556	we'll talk to you but if it doesn't improve you're out
NIC-herring6-0557	you're out
NIC-herring6-0558	i wish they would do that with the kids
NIC-herring6-0559	you know
NIC-herring6-0560	because the parents in essence sign a contract with you know with the kids when they get there which is the handbook
NIC-herring6-0561	you break that you should be out
JES-herring6-0562	right
NIC-herring6-0563	oh no no no but the kids continue to go
NIC-herring6-0564	you know
NIC-herring6-0565	it's just i don't know
NIC-herring6-0566	it really bothers me
NIC-herring6-0567	i'm looking for a rough year next year i'm telling you
NIC-herring6-0568	it's gonna be rough
NIC-herring6-0569	i have the teachers on one side expecting me to do everything
NIC-herring6-0571	i have
NIC-herring6-0572	i don't know
NIC-herring6-0576	yeah i'll tell her
JES-herring6-0579	right
NIC-herring6-0581	because father derrik used to bring people all the time but that was him but now father nichols is going to be doing the same thing so
NIC-herring6-0582	i'm hungry
JES-herring6-0584	i'm still having coffee
NIC-herring6-0585	i already had my coffee
NIC-herring6-0586	i'm hungry
NIC-herring6-0590	that sounds pretty good
NIC-herring6-0594	i guess we could hop in the car with it and go get it
NIC-herring6-0597	it's portable

NIC-herring6-0618	what ethical dilemma do i have in my place of business
NIC-herring6-0619	let me see
NIC-herring6-0620	i hate my boss
NIC-herring6-0621	i think she's a hypocrite
NIC-herring6-0622	ah my ethical dilemma
NIC-herring6-0623	the fact that i'm choosing to work with her closer now in my new position
NIC-herring6-0624	that's my ethical dilemma
NIC-herring6-0625	i don't know how i'm going to work that out
JES-herring6-0626	isn't there something you done in saint thomas about ethics
NIC-herring6-0629	and it really bothers me that peter got a the same thing that i got
JES-herring6-0630	how do you know
JES-herring6-0631	you don't know this
NIC-herring6-0632	because everybody was saying it
NIC-herring6-0633	everybody got a twenty on their presentation
NIC-herring6-0634	i mean come on
NIC-herring6-0635	my presentation was a hell of a lot better than a lot of other people's there
JES-herring6-0636	yes but
JES-herring6-0638	i got my grade the day after and i posted my thing during class
NIC-herring6-0639	i posted i sent her my thing on monday the day right after class and it's friday today and she still hasn't posted my grade
JES-herring6-0640	then you send her an email
JES-herring6-0641	uh doctor beckerman um i just wanted to confirm that you did receive my
NIC-herring6-0642	she did
NIC-herring6-0643	she sent me an email that she received it
JES-herring6-0644	oh ok
JES-herring6-0645	were you able to open it alright you know
KAY-sastre9-0005	they do it every day
KAY-sastre9-0006	so when you come here don't be afraid if you hear it
KAY-sastre9-0007	because you know they're practicing
VAL-sastre9-0008	yeah yeah they have to put these earphones
KAY-sastre9-0010	really
KAY-sastre9-0013	when
KAY-sastre9-0015	but it's not so loud because the range is all the way over there
VAL-sastre9-0016	yeah
KAY-sastre9-0017	which is great
KAY-sastre9-0018	i imagine if we were right there that would be a problem
VAL-sastre9-0019	yeah
KAY-sastre9-0020	but there's a lot of distance
KAY-sastre9-0021	so i don't think it's a problem
VAL-sastre9-0022	no no no it's not a problem
KAY-sastre9-0024	that's a good idea
VAL-sastre9-0025	yeah
KAY-sastre9-0026	but they have like like little dummies
VAL-sastre9-0027	yeah
KAY-sastre9-0028	and i think you're supposed to like target them or something
VAL-sastre9-0029	that is the target right
KAY-sastre9-0030	yeah
VAL-sastre9-0031	yeah i used to do that
VAL-sastre9-0034	obstacle courses
VAL-sastre9-0036	oh my god
KAY-sastre9-0038	so i asked what was happening
KAY-sastre9-0039	and they said that the the the corrections is coming and also f b i
VAL-sastre9-0040	oh my goodness so we're expanding
KAY-sastre9-0041	exactly
KAY-sastre9-0048	they're very smart
KAY-sastre9-0049	and they all have background in what they do which is broadcasting videos
VAL-sastre9-0050	wow
KAY-sastre9-0051	and like actually recording
KAY-sastre9-0052	and editing and all that stuff
KAY-sastre9-0053	and it's gonna be great trying to learn from them because they're all experts
KAY-sastre9-0054	so i'm kind of looking forward to doing that
VAL-sastre9-0055	always learn from the experts
KAY-sastre9-0056	exactly
VAL-sastre9-0057	you can always become good yourself
KAY-sastre9-0058	well yeah they're good trainers
KAY-sastre9-0059	so i i have faith that i'll be able to do it eventually
KAY-sastre9-0064	so for instance i report to the lieutenant
KAY-sastre9-0066	and the whole place reports to the major
KAY-sastre9-0067	they report to different people
VAL-sastre9-0068	right
KAY-sastre9-0069	but he's the one in charge ultimately
VAL-sastre9-0072	oh
KAY-sastre9-0074	but everybody reports to her
KAY-sastre9-0075	but i i report to the to the lieutenant which is in the command staff
KAY-sastre9-0076	she's so beautiful
KAY-sastre9-0077	she's very young
VAL-sastre9-0082	because you know being a mother is no easy task
KAY-sastre9-0083	no that i know
VAL-sastre9-0084	but it's the best that anybody could experience in life
KAY-sastre9-0085	well you you have a lot of experience being a laughs
KAY-sastre9-0086	you reared us all
VAL-sastre9-0087	yeah
KAY-sastre9-0088	you had six of us
KAY-sastre9-0089	and you put us all through school
KAY-sastre9-0093	i probably could never have done anything without you
KAY-sastre9-0094	thank you sis
KAY-sastre9-0096	and now you're putting carmencita my daughter through school which is not an easy task either
KAY-sastre9-0097	and your children too
VAL-sastre9-0098	i tell you i think that now is is difficult
VAL-sastre9-0104	huh
KAY-sastre9-0107	and my daughter now is using you know
KAY-sastre9-0108	i got her the phone as a protection when she goes to school whatever she has to call but they're text messaging
VAL-sastre9-0109	yeah now they don't even have to use your minutes
VAL-sastre9-0115	i have to check my son you know
KAY-sastre9-0116	you don't you haven't checked at all
KAY-sastre9-0119	so when do you plan to
KAY-sastre9-0123	his his phone
KAY-sastre9-0133	but it takes time it's very tedious
VAL-sastre9-0134	yeah
VAL-sastre9-0139	really
KAY-sastre9-0140	it's it's already smeared
KAY-sastre9-0142	see look the number eight it's like it's all messed up
KAY-sastre9-0145	carmencita is really fast
KAY-sastre9-0147	carmencita is so fast on that on that email or the text messaging on her phone
VAL-sastre9-0148	she'll answer faster to a text message than to answer her phone
KAY-sastre9-0149	i think so
VAL-sastre9-0150	i'm serious
KAY-sastre9-0151	and they do this all day so now
KAY-sastre9-0152	and was telling me that since she is so close to that phone that another way to get to her so she behaves is say to her
KAY-sastre9-0153	you know if you if you miss behave
KAY-sastre9-0154	because you know she has a tendency with her friends and everythings
KAY-sastre9-0155	then what they're gonna take the phone away when you get name from school you can't text message
KAY-sastre9-0156	and then then she says how quickly she's gonna be behave because she wants to do it
VAL-sastre9-0157	you know i wish that that would be a solution to the problem
KAY-sastre9-0158	but it's a a at least it's a suggestion
VAL-sastre9-0159	you know taking away
KAY-sastre9-0160	but what do you say
VAL-sastre9-0161	you know the the the
KAY-sastre9-0162	you you have psychology
KAY-sastre9-0163	what what what's the best way
VAL-sastre9-0164	my philosophy is totally different that
VAL-sastre9-0165	i believe in you know look for something that she's doing right
VAL-sastre9-0166	and reward her
KAY-sastre9-0167	yeah but what about the stuff that she's doing negative
VAL-sastre9-0168	some how
KAY-sastre9-0169	how do you take that away
VAL-sastre9-0170	you have to find a way to to either overlook it
VAL-sastre9-0171	and then reframe the whole circumstances
VAL-sastre9-0174	taking away taking away taking away
KAY-sastre9-0176	she was extremely nasty
VAL-sastre9-0177	that's not good
KAY-sastre9-0178	so we're gonna punish her this weekend
KAY-sastre9-0179	she can't go out
KAY-sastre9-0180	she she could go out
KAY-sastre9-0181	but she can't be with her friends which is that's a real punishment
VAL-sastre9-0183	yeah that that to me that kind of punishment is like when you have finished all your recourses
KAY-sastre9-0184	to be with her friends not
VAL-sastre9-0185	to reframe the circumstances
VAL-sastre9-0186	you've gotta find ways that she would wanna do it voluntarily to behave
VAL-sastre9-0187	to to get her clothing out
VAL-sastre9-0189	er finding ways
KAY-sastre9-0190	well i think the fact that she wants to be with her friends every weekend
KAY-sastre9-0191	and if and i'm not letting her do it this weekend because she didn't behave
KAY-sastre9-0192	i don't think she'll be she'll be nasty again
VAL-sastre9-0193	i think that she will be
KAY-sastre9-0194	you do
KAY-sastre9-0195	ok let's try
KAY-sastre9-0196	let's use it as a as a test
VAL-sastre9-0197	try it try it
VAL-sastre9-0198	try it
VAL-sastre9-0199	i mean some times you have to use that kind of um
KAY-sastre9-0200	training
VAL-sastre9-0201	you know training yeah
VAL-sastre9-0208	well many times i give him the silent treatment
VAL-sastre9-0217	are you mad at me
VAL-sastre9-0218	i say
VAL-sastre9-0219	yeah i am
VAL-sastre9-0220	what do you expect
VAL-sastre9-0221	you want me to have a smile on my face
VAL-sastre9-0223	but we have a very good communication thank god
VAL-sastre9-0224	and he knows that i'll you know do whatever i can to support him
KAY-sastre9-0225	yeah but like if he but if he answers you nasty
KAY-sastre9-0226	and he goes into his room
VAL-sastre9-0227	i say you know
VAL-sastre9-0228	is that necessary
VAL-sastre9-0229	i say
VAL-sastre9-0230	is that necessary
VAL-sastre9-0231	we we in this household believe in respect
VAL-sastre9-0232	and we try to work it out
VAL-sastre9-0236	a hundred and twenty god willing
VAL-sastre9-0238	thank you
VAL-sastre9-0239	and you know they go through some kind of osmosis when they hit sixteen
VAL-sastre9-0240	sixteen seventeen

VAL-sastre9-0243	oh you know mother
VAL-sastre9-0244	you're the greatest
KAY-sastre9-0245	that was nice
VAL-sastre9-0246	yeah
VAL-sastre9-0248	yeah
VAL-sastre9-0250	so i said to him
VAL-sastre9-0251	talk to me in two more years
KAY-sastre9-0253	because you plan to what
VAL-sastre9-0254	well because they go through this osmosis
KAY-sastre9-0255	bring in the rains
VAL-sastre9-0256	then hey what what happened to the to most kids
KAY-sastre9-0257	exactly
VAL-sastre9-0258	no i'm praying that it won't happen to my kid
VAL-sastre9-0259	i mean
VAL-sastre9-0262	and a that seems to be a problem
VAL-sastre9-0264	yeah
KAY-sastre9-0265	did he when he went away you didn't see him
VAL-sastre9-0266	no no he was a he went to europe

VAL-sastre9-0292	and everybody goes into the sac

AUD-sastre8-0001	well usually before you go to the bed you have to take him to do pee pee
PAO-sastre8-0002	yeah we did
AUD-sastre8-0003	but he still
PAO-sastre8-0004	but i guess he still got nervous when he was in the car
AUD-sastre8-0005	yeah
PAO-sastre8-0006	and he likes to stick his head out the window
PAO-sastre8-0010	no because we put it really high high enough for only his head
PAO-sastre8-0012	sometimes he might put his feet
PAO-sastre8-0014	but he can't get out
PAO-sastre8-0016	no it's about um
PAO-sastre8-0017	his hands could touch the top
PAO-sastre8-0018	and his it's as high it's high enough for him to put his hands
AUD-sastre8-0019	and do you hold him

AUD-sastre8-0047	did you play volleyball at the other school you were in
PAO-sastre8-0048	we did
PAO-sastre8-0050	it didn't work out

AUD-sastre8-0066	how come
PAO-sastre8-0067	i don't know
PAO-sastre8-0068	i think it was because she wasn't doing so good
PAO-sastre8-0069	i'm not sure because maybe that's what they thought
PAO-sastre8-0075	maybe it was because
PAO-sastre8-0076	i don't know
PAO-sastre8-0077	maybe it was because that she had her grades low
PAO-sastre8-0078	because if you have an f or maybe more than one f you can't go into the team
AUD-sastre8-0079	ah
AUD-sastre8-0080	oh oh
PAO-sastre8-0081	maybe
PAO-sastre8-0082	but maybe that's not the reason
PAO-sastre8-0083	maybe they just didn't like her
PAO-sastre8-0084	or maybe they had better players
AUD-sastre8-0085	and when do you have to practice

REB-zeledon2-0215	yeah
MAT-zeledon2-0216	and i'm looking at
REB-zeledon2-0217	well what sucks for me
MAT-zeledon2-0218	squinting you know

REB-zeledon2-0226	no i can't see far
MAT-zeledon2-0227	ok
REB-zeledon2-0228	i mean you'd have to be like right here for me to see you
MAT-zeledon2-0229	really
MAT-zeledon2-0230	i have twenty twenty from like close like if i didn't have them on i could see i can read fine you know
REB-zeledon2-0231	oh no i can't
MAT-zeledon2-0232	like i if you know i can read that
REB-zeledon2-0233	oh no
MAT-zeledon2-0234	but you know if like if you were to say what does that say i would laughs
REB-zeledon2-0235	i like if i was
REB-zeledon2-0236	no if i had to read this like i had to be like like this close
MAT-zeledon2-0237	oh really
REB-zeledon2-0238	to be able to see it yeah it's really bad
MAT-zeledon2-0239	oh ok
MAT-zeledon2-0240	oh right
REB-zeledon2-0241	and i'm scared to do lasik
MAT-zeledon2-0242	yeah i was thinking about that
MAT-zeledon2-0243	what
REB-zeledon2-0244	they well they recommend you to wait till you're twenty five
MAT-zeledon2-0245	oh really
REB-zeledon2-0246	because it's when your vision kinda just balances out
MAT-zeledon2-0247	oh
REB-zeledon2-0248	because at first they told me it was twenty one
MAT-zeledon2-0249	i didn't know that
REB-zeledon2-0250	but i'm twenty one and my vision keeps you know increasing and getting worse
MAT-zeledon2-0251	yeah it it keeps getting worse yeah
REB-zeledon2-0252	and um i'd say decreasing and then um my doctor he's like oh wait till you're twenty five
REB-zeledon2-0253	and i'm scared because like if they do it and it doesn't come out right you can't go back to contacts
MAT-zeledon2-0254	yeah
REB-zeledon2-0255	you have to do glasses
REB-zeledon2-0256	so
MAT-zeledon2-0257	why can't you go to contacts because
REB-zeledon2-0258	i don't know
MAT-zeledon2-0259	i guess it's something with
REB-zeledon2-0260	it's something yeah something they do that
MAT-zeledon2-0261	because they cut you know they they like cut the the retina the like retina off
REB-zeledon2-0262	if they laser it
REB-zeledon2-0263	yeah but there's two different kinds of lasik
MAT-zeledon2-0264	is there
REB-zeledon2-0265	yeah there's lasik and then there is another procedure
REB-zeledon2-0266	i saw it on this show it's called ten years younger
REB-zeledon2-0268	on t l c i think it's

REB-zeledon2-0390	i i couldn't be able to do it
REB-zeledon2-0391	i couldn't be able to handle it

MAT-zeledon2-0785	it's cultural that's what i'm saying
REB-zeledon2-0786	because
MAT-zeledon2-0787	and it's like it's like what

MAR-maria10-0177	i was like you were like
MAR-maria10-0178	it's in the server
MAR-maria10-0179	i'm like
MAR-maria10-0180	it is not
MAR-maria10-0181	i'm looking at the server
MAR-maria10-0182	you looked and it was already in the system of course
MAR-maria10-0184	that's right
MAR-maria10-0185	they
MAR-maria10-0186	on the eighteen it's a teacher plannig day so we should
MAR-maria10-0188	next friday
MAR-maria10-0189	there'll be no children
MAR-maria10-0190	we should plan to go to a and b at least to review all our punch list to make sure
MAR-maria10-0192	the teachers are there
MAR-maria10-0194	uh monday is a legal holiday
MAR-maria10-0195	i'd rather not use it unless we want to because they have to get paid overtime
MAR-maria10-0196	but that thing that would only be at u one
MAR-maria10-0198	check if it's done it's not done whatever it is
MAR-maria10-0199	then we go to b and then
MAR-maria10-0200	to me u should be the last one simply because they just finished
MAR-maria10-0201	so they are not going to have time to have finish it
MAR-maria10-0202	right and that's what i and that's what i told tom and said i would
MAR-maria10-0203	you know
MAR-maria10-0204	let's do a first
MAR-maria10-0205	if we can do b that would be great so we can finish those two uh
MAR-maria10-0206	and then it's just a matter of waiting when they are ready for you because the are not going to be ready for us to review u one because they haven't done anything
MAR-maria10-0207	you are trying to get the damm building get a water with it on
MAR-maria10-0209	they just run the bacterials and like
MAR-maria10-0210	i asked peter
MAR-maria10-0211	aren't you supposed to have bacterial test before
MAR-maria10-0212	i did neither
MAR-maria10-0213	i did
MAR-maria10-0214	well somehow they some
MAR-maria10-0215	that's
MAR-maria10-0216	right
MAR-maria10-0217	right
MAR-maria10-0218	that's what martha told me
MAR-maria10-0219	right right
MAR-maria10-0220	and the bacterials have a limited time
MAR-maria10-0221	they only have thirty days
MAR-maria10-0222	no it's thirty days
MAR-maria10-0223	thirty days
MAR-maria10-0224	the bacterial test is only the result is only good for thirty days
MAR-maria10-0225	so if you haven't gone but they have h r s approval which is the part that there's a little confusing
MAR-maria10-0226	because they wouldn't be able to cook if they haven't h r s approval
MAR-maria10-0227	or maybe until they run
MAR-maria10-0229	somebody is a blind eye
MAR-maria10-0231	h r s is health department
MAR-maria10-0232	that's the big one
MAR-maria10-0233	oh so h r s hasn't because a water with steel it's not legal
MAR-maria10-0234	oh so there are satelliting in it
MAR-maria10-0235	it's called satelliting in
MAR-maria10-0236	they took on on monday
MAR-maria10-0237	maybe it was tuesday
MAR-maria10-0238	maybe it was tuesday
MAR-maria10-0239	because sent an email saying said that they hadn't been there
MAR-maria10-0240	and they were testing it
MAR-maria10-0241	and that's when i forwarded the that information to and i said
MAR-maria10-0242	i'm confused
MAR-maria10-0243	school is open
MAR-maria10-0244	and now you are running bacterials
MAR-maria10-0245	and he's like
MAR-maria10-0246	he was confused too
MAR-maria10-0247	he was confused too
MAR-maria10-0248	apparently
MAR-maria10-0249	it's a package that goes a document control
MAR-maria10-0250	i think we need to create
MAR-maria10-0251	take our drawings make a new one as cold fish and get rid of everything but the fish number
MAR-maria10-0252	and i guess furniture
MAR-maria10-0253	we've we did for we did it for simply because they didn't give us the numbers but it was turned out convenient because then we already have the drawing
MAR-maria10-0254	the drawing already had existed
MAR-maria10-0255	ask him about that because that is just a matter of
MAR-maria10-0256	change it above
MAR-maria10-0257	well you could actually make a new one because the blog it's an extra
MAR-maria10-0258	the tag numbers are an extra
MAR-maria10-0259	you just edit the blog
MAR-maria10-0260	you make a new drawing add it the blog and all become little fishies
MAR-maria10-0261	ask him ask him
MAR-maria10-0262	she didn't tell me whatever it is and i wasn't supposed to listen to
MAR-maria10-0263	now i want to know
MAR-maria10-0264	now you got me curious
MAR-maria10-0265	i said curious
MAR-maria10-0266	i'm gonna do it
MAR-maria10-0267	there you go
MAR-maria10-0268	nothing relating the flooring
MAR-maria10-0269	um
MAR-maria10-0271	good

SAM-sastre12-0712	the
SAM-sastre12-0713	oh ok
SAM-sastre12-0714	but they've got to remember that they are not gonna be let in until after the break
MAD-sastre12-0715	ok
MAD-sastre12-0716	no i'll remind her
MAD-sastre12-0718	no no i'll remind her
MAD-sastre12-0719	but she was like
MAD-sastre12-0720	no i don't think so
MAD-sastre12-0721	because i said
MAD-sastre12-0722	are we picking you up
MAD-sastre12-0723	and she was
MAD-sastre12-0724	no no no i'll go on my own
MAD-sastre12-0725	i know how to get there
MAD-sastre12-0726	i'll go on my own
MAD-sastre12-0727	and then then you know
MAD-sastre12-0728	because i guess i guess she's like lidia
MAD-sastre12-0729	just make sure that everything's ok at school and then go
SAM-sastre12-0730	oh yeah they start early anyways probably
MAD-sastre12-0731	yeah they if they start the way they're supposed to it's at seven thirty
SAM-sastre12-0732	yeah they leave what ten thirty
MAD-sastre12-0733	but now you don't have to turn in the er you know you don't have to
SAM-sastre12-0734	the keys
MAD-sastre12-0735	yeah they turn in the keys
MAD-sastre12-0736	but you don't have to do grade the bubble sheets anymore
SAM-sastre12-0737	oh really
MAD-sastre12-0738	like it's all electronic
SAM-sastre12-0739	oh electronic
SAM-sastre12-0740	oh that's cool
MAD-sastre12-0741	right so that's why nowadays if you've get a check off sheet it's like
SAM-sastre12-0742	yeah seven thirty or so
MAD-sastre12-0743	ah we don't have to turn in grade bubble sheets which was the important stuff
SAM-sastre12-0744	yeah which was everything that i was always behind
MAD-sastre12-0745	yeah now the problem will be that if some of these people aren't like for her right now she should already be inputting the grades and uploading them
MAD-sastre12-0746	because if they start waiting you know what
MAD-sastre12-0747	computers are gonna be stuck and slow and all that stuff which is what happens in the other quarters
SAM-sastre12-0748	oh really
MAD-sastre12-0749	yeah
MAD-sastre12-0750	so i had um another albert called me
MAD-sastre12-0751	and he and i got some of his papers
MAD-sastre12-0752	and he goes
MAD-sastre12-0753	no i'm putting the other one
MAD-sastre12-0754	he goes
MAD-sastre12-0755	what date are we supposed to print out our class list for you
MAD-sastre12-0756	and i said
MAD-sastre12-0757	well it's always supposed to be the last day of the quarter
MAD-sastre12-0758	but that would be the fifth
MAD-sastre12-0760	and then he goes
MAD-sastre12-0761	yeah but
MAD-sastre12-0762	i go
MAD-sastre12-0763	yeah but i'm sure you have mostly seniors so you know what
SAM-sastre12-0764	just do
MAD-sastre12-0765	and i doubt it that you're gonna be having any kids with drop today
MAD-sastre12-0766	so you might as well print it out today
MAD-sastre12-0767	he goes
MAD-sastre12-0768	ok ok
MAD-sastre12-0770	i think so
SAM-sastre12-0771	oh ok

MAD-sastre12-0773	well i'll ask him i'll ask him
SAM-sastre12-0774	yeah
MAD-sastre12-0776	because
SAM-sastre12-0778	right
SAM-sastre12-0779	maybe that's what needs done i don't know
MAD-sastre12-0780	unless like the kids are home
SAM-sastre12-0781	but they can call you
SAM-sastre12-0782	like that's what i did with caroline like i went with rachel and um

ABI-zeledon6-0093	emilio is a very complicated person

ABI-zeledon6-0104	but nothing
ELL-zeledon6-0105	yeah
ELL-zeledon6-0106	yeah
ABI-zeledon6-0107	ok
ELL-zeledon6-0108	i don't know how selena always always governs laura
ABI-zeledon6-0109	she does
ELL-zeledon6-0110	she wants yeah she went to selena
ELL-zeledon6-0114	yeah so i called her
ELL-zeledon6-0116	selena was eating right
ELL-zeledon6-0117	and then she got out of the lunch
ELL-zeledon6-0118	and she was like
ELL-zeledon6-0123	i don't know man
ELL-zeledon6-0124	she i i don't like that lady
ELL-zeledon6-0125	that lady like she is always like
ABI-zeledon6-0126	she's too bossy
ELL-zeledon6-0127	she's always bossing
ABI-zeledon6-0128	oh you ok you wanna hear a story
ABI-zeledon6-0129	ok
ABI-zeledon6-0130	um before yesterday before yesterday iria gave me a job to do
ABI-zeledon6-0134	and then the next thing the next step that i had to do was um divide the patients by their case manager
ABI-zeledon6-0136	so there was there there was a stack of papers for clara
ABI-zeledon6-0137	and there was a stack of patients for
ELL-zeledon6-0138	selena
ABI-zeledon6-0139	selena right
ABI-zeledon6-0141	right
ABI-zeledon6-0142	so and i go to selena
ABI-zeledon6-0143	but the thing was that they were active patients right
ABI-zeledon6-0144	so then active patients she wanted to follow them into their
ABI-zeledon6-0145	so i um whether it was built or not built right
ABI-zeledon6-0146	so then all the ones that i had finished were all built
ABI-zeledon6-0147	and they were active
ABI-zeledon6-0148	and they were all built
ABI-zeledon6-0149	so then i went to selena
ABI-zeledon6-0159	and i didn't even write on the post it the problem
ABI-zeledon6-0160	iria wrote it with her handwriting
ABI-zeledon6-0161	and it was simple
ABI-zeledon6-0162	it was a simple simple problem
ABI-zeledon6-0163	it was um one of them was to call the nurse and verify that there was a sharp container in the house
ABI-zeledon6-0164	and the other one was um to call the nurse and verify that it was that his her son was still the house the caregiver care giver or something like that
ABI-zeledon6-0165	very simple
ABI-zeledon6-0167	yeah that you could do it in five minutes
ABI-zeledon6-0168	i understood what selena was telling me
ABI-zeledon6-0169	but that's not my problem because i'm just telling her what iria is telling me to do
ABI-zeledon6-0171	and out of them all those ten two of them had problems
ABI-zeledon6-0176	and she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0182	and she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0187	yeah like because it's true
ABI-zeledon6-0189	like if iria is telling you
ELL-zeledon6-0190	iria told you
ABI-zeledon6-0194	and not only that
ABI-zeledon6-0195	like if she says she doesn't feel like doing it she doesn't feel like doing it
ABI-zeledon6-0196	she is paying selena a a salary of a case manager so she could solve those problems
ABI-zeledon6-0197	so the reason she's the case manager for the patient
ELL-zeledon6-0198	right
ABI-zeledon6-0203	i'm not gonna bitch at her
ELL-zeledon6-0204	oh yeah no you can't talk to her if you don't have patience
ABI-zeledon6-0205	i'm not gonna talk back to her
ABI-zeledon6-0206	i'm not gonna talk back to her
ABI-zeledon6-0207	and i'm not gonna bitch at her because there's just no point
ABI-zeledon6-0208	so i go to her um
ABI-zeledon6-0209	i looked at her
ELL-zeledon6-0212	selena
ABI-zeledon6-0213	all these mosquitoes
ABI-zeledon6-0217	like she got it from my hand
ABI-zeledon6-0218	and she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0219	she put it to the side completely to the side
ABI-zeledon6-0220	and she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0224	so this is gonna be this is gonna be later on whenever i have a chance
ELL-zeledon6-0228	you're good already
ABI-zeledon6-0229	yeah
ABI-zeledon6-0230	and then i gave her the other eight patients
ABI-zeledon6-0231	and then i go to her
ABI-zeledon6-0232	and then she goes
ELL-zeledon6-0233	ah
ABI-zeledon6-0236	and i'm like
ABI-zeledon6-0237	like i looked at her
ABI-zeledon6-0238	and i'm like
ABI-zeledon6-0240	you know her assistant
ABI-zeledon6-0241	and i was like
ABI-zeledon6-0244	and then she just turned around
ABI-zeledon6-0245	and she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0251	or i'll do it for you first thing in the morning
ABI-zeledon6-0252	you know to put it to the side
ABI-zeledon6-0254	so it was funny because that's the way selena reacted
ABI-zeledon6-0255	but then i went to clara
ABI-zeledon6-0256	clara had her own stack
ABI-zeledon6-0257	and clara had one patient with one problem
ABI-zeledon6-0258	and i go up to her
ABI-zeledon6-0259	and i'm like
ABI-zeledon6-0262	and she is like
ABI-zeledon6-0264	she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0266	like she handled it with such patience
ABI-zeledon6-0267	the thing is
ABI-zeledon6-0268	i think she saw me
ABI-zeledon6-0269	she saw the situation with selena
ABI-zeledon6-0270	she saw how selena had reacted to it
ABI-zeledon6-0271	so i think clara is being smart in the sense of like i'm not gonna be a bitch
ABI-zeledon6-0272	i'm not gonna talk bad
ELL-zeledon6-0273	of course
ELL-zeledon6-0274	and not even that
ABI-zeledon6-0275	i'm i'm not gonna handle
ELL-zeledon6-0276	i'm not gonna look
ABI-zeledon6-0277	i'm not gonna look
ABI-zeledon6-0278	or like i'm gonna handle the job with ease
ABI-zeledon6-0279	do you get me
ABI-zeledon6-0280	so she looks at me
ABI-zeledon6-0281	and she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0284	and she like clapped her hand
ABI-zeledon6-0285	and then she goes
ABI-zeledon6-0287	and i just laughed
ABI-zeledon6-0288	and she was like

ELL-zeledon6-0956	everyone's boots dot com
ABI-zeledon6-0959	possibly yeah
ABI-zeledon6-0960	yeah that could just be any
ELL-zeledon6-0961	how much does a term in f i u cost you
ABI-zeledon6-0962	about
ELL-zeledon6-0963	how many classes do you take
ABI-zeledon6-0964	exactly if we are gonna take all four classes it'll cost about a thousand and
ABI-zeledon6-0965	i think it was six hundred more or less
ABI-zeledon6-0966	ok it's a hundred dollars per credit
ABI-zeledon6-0967	a hundred dollars per credit
ABI-zeledon6-0968	and then each class is more or less worth three credits
ABI-zeledon6-0969	like english is worth three credits
ABI-zeledon6-0970	and math is worth three credits
ABI-zeledon6-0971	do you get me
ELL-zeledon6-0972	yeah
ABI-zeledon6-0973	but um like let's say that semester that i took it the the freshmans arrived or whatever
ABI-zeledon6-0974	that wasn't worth
ABI-zeledon6-0975	that was only worth one credit
ABI-zeledon6-0976	do you get me
ABI-zeledon6-0977	so let's say you are taking four classes
ABI-zeledon6-0978	um so four times three each one being three credits that's twelve credits
ABI-zeledon6-0980	and then you have to then pay all the fees
ABI-zeledon6-0981	the parking fee the fee
ELL-zeledon6-0982	i don't have that fee yet
ABI-zeledon6-0983	yeah
ELL-zeledon6-0984	i don't have that fee
ABI-zeledon6-0985	and then it comes out to like i guess a little less like a thousand five hundred or something
ELL-zeledon6-0986	well for me it's a thousand flat
ELL-zeledon6-0987	everything for five classes was a thousand flat
ELL-zeledon6-0988	and that's five classes
ABI-zeledon6-0989	um wow
ELL-zeledon6-0990	that's what i paid last year
ELL-zeledon6-0991	it's a thousand flat
ABI-zeledon6-0992	wow that's good
ELL-zeledon6-0993	nine hundred and ninety nine dollars and like seventy six cents or something like that
ABI-zeledon6-0994	it's good
ELL-zeledon6-0995	yeah
ABI-zeledon6-0996	the f i u
ELL-zeledon6-0997	i paid that out of my pocket
ELL-zeledon6-0998	i had a i had a savings account
ELL-zeledon6-0999	i paid for my for my miami dade term half of my car
ABI-zeledon6-1000	yeah
ELL-zeledon6-1001	and that's it
ELL-zeledon6-1002	and then my mom paid the other half of the car
ELL-zeledon6-1003	and that's it
ELL-zeledon6-1004	and my dad didn't help with squat laughing
ABI-zeledon6-1005	that's not good
ABI-zeledon6-1006	um
ELL-zeledon6-1007	that's how it is
ABI-zeledon6-1008	but i was gonna tell you the the thing here er ok
ELL-zeledon6-1010	i think so
ABI-zeledon6-1011	yeah and here it's just a hundred
ELL-zeledon6-1012	well
ABI-zeledon6-1013	so it's about thirty
ABI-zeledon6-1014	times twelve how much is that
ELL-zeledon6-1015	but that's what i'm saying
ABI-zeledon6-1017	i don't know i just came straight over here
ELL-zeledon6-1018	i'm gonna do my i'm gonna
ABI-zeledon6-1019	finish
ELL-zeledon6-1020	practically like saving money
ABI-zeledon6-1021	it is saving money
ABI-zeledon6-1022	just came straight over here
ABI-zeledon6-1023	carlos was here and
ABI-zeledon6-1024	i like the school
ELL-zeledon6-1025	oh that's true
ELL-zeledon6-1026	that's true
ELL-zeledon6-1027	i'm gonna have to come to this school
ABI-zeledon6-1028	he he guided me through it
ELL-zeledon6-1029	the school
ABI-zeledon6-1031	no you get the hang of it
ELL-zeledon6-1032	i know i'll get the hang of it because when i first saw miami dade i was
ELL-zeledon6-1033	oh my god this is so confusing
ABI-zeledon6-1034	ah you see miami dade seems too confusing to me
ABI-zeledon6-1035	not confusing
ABI-zeledon6-1036	but it's seemed like a jail to me
ELL-zeledon6-1037	jail
ABI-zeledon6-1038	yeah
ELL-zeledon6-1039	no
ABI-zeledon6-1040	because it's just the buildings
ELL-zeledon6-1041	this class is ugly compared to the classes i had in miami dade
ABI-zeledon6-1042	the buildings are too like gray
ELL-zeledon6-1043	only outside
ABI-zeledon6-1044	this is this is just this is a small class though to be honest
ABI-zeledon6-1045	english classes are put in a really small class
ABI-zeledon6-1046	most of our
ABI-zeledon6-1047	all my other classes i ever had even my math class which is right in this building but towards the other end they're all big classes like auditorium like
ABI-zeledon6-1048	even if it's just for a hundred students
ABI-zeledon6-1049	but they're the type that you walk in
ABI-zeledon6-1050	and they have like steps
ABI-zeledon6-1051	you get me
ABI-zeledon6-1052	that you go up and then
ABI-zeledon6-1053	that's how all my classes are
ABI-zeledon6-1054	the only classes that have been really small always have been my english classes
ABI-zeledon6-1056	all the other ones are like those types
ABI-zeledon6-1058	i just don't like how the building looks
ABI-zeledon6-1059	f i u have a lot of arts
ABI-zeledon6-1060	and like the buildings look prettier and like
ELL-zeledon6-1062	huh i don't look at it
ELL-zeledon6-1063	and and miami dade has like
ABI-zeledon6-1064	but it gives you more environment
ELL-zeledon6-1065	miami dade has like arts stuff too
ABI-zeledon6-1067	oh it's one of those
ELL-zeledon6-1068	it's one of those where where ever you need to go
ABI-zeledon6-1069	yeah it's building four
ELL-zeledon6-1070	exactly
ABI-zeledon6-1071	and then you just find the room inside
ELL-zeledon6-1072	well it's building four like lets say four two zero five
ELL-zeledon6-1073	it's building four second floor fifth room
ABI-zeledon6-1074	yeah
ABI-zeledon6-1075	yeah exactly
ELL-zeledon6-1076	that's the way it's split up
ELL-zeledon6-1080	em that's easy
ELL-zeledon6-1082	building three and parking here
ELL-zeledon6-1083	and in between each building parking there's a little parking in cases there's not space
ELL-zeledon6-1084	and
ELL-zeledon6-1086	i always find space close to my class
ABI-zeledon6-1087	parking
ABI-zeledon6-1088	no parking is very very difficult
ABI-zeledon6-1089	extremely difficult honestly
ABI-zeledon6-1090	you have to be here about
ABI-zeledon6-1091	like i'm really used to this
ABI-zeledon6-1092	i really know like i just go into the garage
ABI-zeledon6-1093	and i go to the fifth floor because there's always gonna be parking there
ABI-zeledon6-1094	but it's pretty difficult
ABI-zeledon6-1095	and takes before like freshman freshman year but the first semester i ever took here i never had such a hard time parking
ABI-zeledon6-1096	but that's because i wasn't like
ABI-zeledon6-1097	and i would get there way early
ABI-zeledon6-1098	like i'll be at school like an hour half an hour before my class
ABI-zeledon6-1099	and it's just like i didn't know to early
ABI-zeledon6-1100	just don't bother looking for parking right
ABI-zeledon6-1101	fifth floor
ABI-zeledon6-1102	can use the elevator
ELL-zeledon6-1104	and somebody left
ELL-zeledon6-1105	somebody always left
ELL-zeledon6-1106	and all i have to do
ABI-zeledon6-1107	no
ABI-zeledon6-1108	and then the buildings here there're just
ABI-zeledon6-1109	they's not by numbers
ABI-zeledon6-1110	but they're by names
ABI-zeledon6-1111	they're like this this building here is the chemistry and physics
ELL-zeledon6-1112	ah i know
ABI-zeledon6-1113	but when you when you've
ELL-zeledon6-1114	this is a chemistry and physics building with an an english class inside of it
ABI-zeledon6-1115	yeah
ABI-zeledon6-1117	yeah
ABI-zeledon6-1118	cause they're using it as an english class you know
ABI-zeledon6-1119	this is obviously a lot of other things
ASH-herring3-0025	six to eight weeks
JAC-herring3-0026	shit

JAC-herring3-0409	no
ASH-herring3-0410	o k

ASH-herring3-0413	i'm like
ASH-herring3-0414	how can claudio cook
ASH-herring3-0415	claudio went home

ASH-herring3-0420	so anyways
ASH-herring3-0421	ah jack i need you to call the people for the title
JAC-herring3-0424	i don't know the phone number
ASH-herring3-0425	you need to tell them you paid ten dollars for them to do a title search
JAC-herring3-0426	yeah
ASH-herring3-0427	the lady says we'll call you don't call us
ASH-herring3-0428	she could've just put those ten dollars in her pocket
JAC-herring3-0430	she gave me a receipt though
JAC-herring3-0431	i don't know where's the receipt right now
ASH-herring3-0432	o k ah i'm so glad she gave you a receipt
ASH-herring3-0433	in that receipt's surely there is a telephone number

JAC-herring3-0436	i'll find it yeah mumble
ASH-herring3-0437	i need to know what the hell is going on with that
ASH-herring3-0439	did i show you how much i got paid
ASH-herring3-0440	i didn't get paid as much as you
ASH-herring3-0441	but i think this is not by much short four hours short
ASH-herring3-0442	so last week you were four hours short
ASH-herring3-0443	this week i'm four hours short
ASH-herring3-0444	because remember that day of training
ASH-herring3-0445	they only paid me for four hours
ASH-herring3-0446	so that's gonna be eight
ASH-herring3-0447	but it doesn't matter because that's what they pay
ASH-herring3-0448	this is what this is what counts
ASH-herring3-0449	this is what the number that we got to look at
ASH-herring3-0450	seven eight nine
ASH-herring3-0452	you think
ASH-herring3-0455	alright
ASH-herring3-0457	ninety five
ASH-herring3-0458	and then here it is four four
ASH-herring3-0459	and seven six
ASH-herring3-0460	that would be nine
ASH-herring3-0463	that's a two
JAC-herring3-0464	oh
ASH-herring3-0465	so five and four
ASH-herring3-0468	and four is nine carry the one
JAC-herring3-0469	no no don't carry nothing
ASH-herring3-0470	nine and four thirteen and that's four
JAC-herring3-0471	because it's five five and and four is nine
ASH-herring3-0472	oh my god
JAC-herring3-0473	why you have to carry something
ASH-herring3-0474	because i don't carry you carry
JAC-herring3-0475	ah
ASH-herring3-0476	o k nine that's thirteen carry the one six seven eight nine
ASH-herring3-0477	and that would be eight
ASH-herring3-0478	and that would be
ASH-herring3-0480	fourteen
JAC-herring3-0481	uhhuh
ASH-herring3-0482	o k so that's what we have right now
ASH-herring3-0483	and upstairs i have about that much
ASH-herring3-0484	and then there's another envelope with that
ASH-herring3-0485	that would be nine
ASH-herring3-0486	that's still eight
ASH-herring3-0491	o k so that's what i have right now
ASH-herring3-0493	what
ASH-herring3-0496	i know but i'm always getting used to
ASH-herring3-0498	just counting one two three four
ASH-herring3-0499	i don't know
ASH-herring3-0500	i'm slow with that
ASH-herring3-0505	how do i know without actually counting that
ASH-herring3-0506	makes no sense
ASH-herring3-0507	o k so anyways
ASH-herring3-0508	i'm i'm sure this can be rounded off but
ASH-herring3-0510	in the i can round it off to two
ASH-herring3-0511	just two period
ASH-herring3-0514	o k forget that
ASH-herring3-0515	i don't have to do that
ASH-herring3-0516	o k listen
ASH-herring3-0517	this is what i need right now
ASH-herring3-0518	this is right
ASH-herring3-0519	this is insurance
ASH-herring3-0520	and this is car payment

JAC-herring3-0718	that's gonna be a real challenge
ASH-herring3-0719	why
ASH-herring3-0720	look
ASH-herring3-0721	they start in june twenty fifth
ASH-herring3-0722	say that i bring her the first week
ASH-herring3-0723	it doesn't matter

JAC-herring3-0790	the problem
ASH-herring3-0791	is like uh uh

ASH-herring3-0800	but it's gonna be ugly
JAC-herring3-0801	ah well
JAC-herring3-0804	the problem that that's not the problem
JAC-herring3-0805	the problem is that the father is trying to do the same that he do when he was the baby's age

ASH-herring3-0843	but you know he could be doing so many other stuff
ASH-herring3-0844	he could be besides failing because well he is failing in some of his classes
ASH-herring3-0845	he
ASH-herring3-0846	ok o k let's think about a normal family
ASH-herring3-0847	no normal kid runs a company
ASH-herring3-0848	well let's just not call it a company
ASH-herring3-0849	no normal kid would be able to pick up a phone talk to another adult
ASH-herring3-0850	let him know what time the job is gonna happen

ASH-herring3-0852	and tell them what time they need to be somewhere at fourteen at fifteen

AME-zeledon1-0183	o k
AME-zeledon1-0187	ah o k o k
AME-zeledon1-0218	it's like the tie
CAR-zeledon1-0234	you have to bond together
CAR-zeledon1-0236	there's no other way around it
AME-zeledon1-0238	but it was tough
AME-zeledon1-0239	the the first year i wanted to to go back to venezuela you know
AME-zeledon1-0240	i didn't like it at all
AME-zeledon1-0241	the first year was really hard
CAR-zeledon1-0242	no obviously because you're used to it
CAR-zeledon1-0243	same thing happened to me
AME-zeledon1-0244	because you don't know nobody and it and it's hard
AME-zeledon1-0245	like i've i've seen here it's hard to make friends
AME-zeledon1-0246	it's hard to like to have good friends that you can you know
AME-zeledon1-0248	rely on
AME-zeledon1-0249	it's like these people that work with you and that's about it
AME-zeledon1-0250	when you go to school these people may leave
AME-zeledon1-0251	these people that are here you're not gonna see them you know
CAR-zeledon1-0252	ever again i know
AME-zeledon1-0253	and in may instead in venezuela when once you start your career that's gonna be the people you're gonna be for five years together
AME-zeledon1-0254	so it's like you know you go to their houses you go to
CAR-zeledon1-0255	exactly i was talking you know it's funny because i was talking to my boyfriend last night about this
CAR-zeledon1-0257	he just graduated from you know college
CAR-zeledon1-0258	he's an architect
AME-zeledon1-0259	in colombia
CAR-zeledon1-0260	he graduated in colombia
AME-zeledon1-0261	o k
CAR-zeledon1-0262	and the funny thing is that i was talking to him because i was telling him how different it is you know from colombia here
AME-zeledon1-0263	right
CAR-zeledon1-0264	because i had the experience as well
AME-zeledon1-0265	right
CAR-zeledon1-0266	you know i i i was there for two years
AME-zeledon1-0267	o k
CAR-zeledon1-0268	and for those two years it was the same people
CAR-zeledon1-0269	if anything
AME-zeledon1-0270	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0271	people just you know dropped off or they filled
AME-zeledon1-0272	right there it is exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0273	courses or they filled the semester or whatever it was
CAR-zeledon1-0274	but every semester you saw the same people
AME-zeledon1-0275	the same people
CAR-zeledon1-0276	the same classes same schedule the same days
AME-zeledon1-0277	right right
CAR-zeledon1-0278	it did it wouldn't it didn't change at all you know what i mean it
AME-zeledon1-0279	i know
CAR-zeledon1-0280	and here you jump from one group of people to another
AME-zeledon1-0281	right
CAR-zeledon1-0282	you really don't
AME-zeledon1-0283	no in the other the other subject that i'm taking the other class is like i don't know nobody
AME-zeledon1-0284	i don't know their names
AME-zeledon1-0285	i don't know where they work
CAR-zeledon1-0286	yeah i i guess the difference
AME-zeledon1-0287	i have no idea
CAR-zeledon1-0288	between here and there is that there you actually get to you know
CAR-zeledon1-0289	you actually make friends like real friends
AME-zeledon1-0290	exactly right right
CAR-zeledon1-0291	because you know those are important years of your life
AME-zeledon1-0292	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0293	number one
AME-zeledon1-0294	no you even work together
CAR-zeledon1-0295	number two you're sharing the same you know career
CAR-zeledon1-0296	same ideas
AME-zeledon1-0297	exactly experiences
CAR-zeledon1-0298	same experiences exactly
AME-zeledon1-0299	i even work with my my like my close friends
CAR-zeledon1-0300	and you you actually you know get good friends
AME-zeledon1-0301	right
CAR-zeledon1-0302	here it's uh almost impossible
AME-zeledon1-0303	yeah it's true
CAR-zeledon1-0304	because you'll have different schedules you know from every every other person
AME-zeledon1-0305	i guess when you're going to the career career you know in the you know not the core you know classes maybe i don't know
CAR-zeledon1-0306	not uh not even because you know what i think anyway i mean
CAR-zeledon1-0307	in my case when when i go to dental school
CAR-zeledon1-0309	yes it's gonna be much more you know um challenging
CAR-zeledon1-0310	and you know i i guess the classes are gonna be mandatory for everyone at
AME-zeledon1-0311	right
CAR-zeledon1-0312	you know specific scheduling
AME-zeledon1-0313	right
CAR-zeledon1-0314	but i don't think that it's gonna be so like
CAR-zeledon1-0315	the classes number one are not gonna be small guaranteed
CAR-zeledon1-0317	whereas in you know colombia venezuela they're smaller
AME-zeledon1-0318	right
CAR-zeledon1-0319	and you you know the amount of the number of people that go into the class
AME-zeledon1-0320	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0321	and number two it's not you know personalised
CAR-zeledon1-0323	you're never gonna get to have that relationship specially with your teachers
AME-zeledon1-0324	right
CAR-zeledon1-0325	where in colombia or venezuela you you know just latin america
AME-zeledon1-0326	exactly yeah yeah
CAR-zeledon1-0327	countries in general you you do
AME-zeledon1-0328	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0329	you know what i mean
CAR-zeledon1-0330	and you know it's funny because i was talking to him last night about that and he was all
AME-zeledon1-0331	yeah
CAR-zeledon1-0332	because he's moving here
AME-zeledon1-0333	and here is more you know people is like you know competing competing
CAR-zeledon1-0334	plus that fact that here plus that fact that here most of the people you know we're in the in a country where everything is you know consuming and consuming and you know
CAR-zeledon1-0335	time flies
CAR-zeledon1-0337	you really don't have time for yourself so
AME-zeledon1-0338	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0339	what happens is that everyone has debts
CAR-zeledon1-0340	everyone has you know bills to pay
CAR-zeledon1-0342	everyone has to take care of their own stuff
AME-zeledon1-0343	right
CAR-zeledon1-0344	everyone works in other words
CAR-zeledon1-0346	in colombia in venezuela you depend on your parents
AME-zeledon1-0347	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0348	and your daddy is paying for all your career
AME-zeledon1-0349	that's true and all you do is study and that's it
CAR-zeledon1-0350	and everything that you know if comes along the way with within those years
CAR-zeledon1-0351	you know that that you're still in school and your career
AME-zeledon1-0352	exactly right
CAR-zeledon1-0353	if you wanna go out
CAR-zeledon1-0354	if you wanna eat somewhere
CAR-zeledon1-0355	if you wanna buy this
CAR-zeledon1-0357	materials you know instruments
AME-zeledon1-0358	you don't need to worry no
CAR-zeledon1-0359	tuition everything you you you don't worry about anything but studying
AME-zeledon1-0360	exactly that's true
CAR-zeledon1-0361	so you do have time for yourself
CAR-zeledon1-0362	and plus you know that's why everything's more you know personalised
CAR-zeledon1-0363	whereas here the schedules might be different for everyone
AME-zeledon1-0364	right
CAR-zeledon1-0365	because of jobs and then
AME-zeledon1-0366	no and people here they have two jobs it's crazy
CAR-zeledon1-0367	er for me i work from seven thirty in the morning
CAR-zeledon1-0369	till four in the afternoon

AME-zeledon1-0378	wow
CAR-zeledon1-0379	it's crazy
AME-zeledon1-0380	it's crazy
CAR-zeledon1-0407	why
CAR-zeledon1-0408	because she deals with more like paperwork
AME-zeledon1-0410	right
CAR-zeledon1-0411	i and you
CAR-zeledon1-0413	we both deal with people
AME-zeledon1-0414	right
CAR-zeledon1-0415	every day
AME-zeledon1-0416	exactly right
CAR-zeledon1-0417	all day long
AME-zeledon1-0422	it's to deal with
CAR-zeledon1-0423	rules and issues for
CAR-zeledon1-0425	you for your children and me for my patients
AME-zeledon1-0426	right
CAR-zeledon1-0427	you know and on top of that it's just the stress of having
CAR-zeledon1-0429	to deal with with you know people's
AME-zeledon1-0430	complaining
CAR-zeledon1-0431	emotions complaints
AME-zeledon1-0432	that's right
CAR-zeledon1-0433	you know
CAR-zeledon1-0434	sarcasm um
CAR-zeledon1-0436	attitudes
CAR-zeledon1-0437	because people give you attitudes and everything
CAR-zeledon1-0438	and you have to learn to deal with that
AME-zeledon1-0439	right
CAR-zeledon1-0440	so i think it's even more tiring
CAR-zeledon1-0442	it's more of a difficult job no i i i don't wanna
AME-zeledon1-0443	right of course no dealing with people face to face is like is hard
AME-zeledon1-0444	it's not easy
AME-zeledon1-0445	especially like me it's the kids plus the parents plus the you know the staff in there
AME-zeledon1-0446	the people the directors everyone you know
CAR-zeledon1-0447	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0463	it is you know
CAR-zeledon1-0464	it's nothing
CAR-zeledon1-0466	you're actually just you know doing whatever
CAR-zeledon1-0484	yeah nice when you're the customer it's good that you know that
CAR-zeledon1-0486	they say and they publicise that you know the customer is always right
CAR-zeledon1-0488	but when you're the owner the business owner
CAR-zeledon1-0490	or when you're the the the the employer or the employee
CAR-zeledon1-0492	and this whole the customer's always right theme
AME-zeledon1-0493	right
CAR-zeledon1-0494	you know it's a pain in the ass
CAR-zeledon1-0496	because you know you get you get treated like you're nothing
AME-zeledon1-0497	right
CAR-zeledon1-0498	people people forget that you know people don't even know that i actually own the place
AME-zeledon1-0499	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0500	so they all treat me when the customers don't know they'll treat me as if i was you know one of those stupid little girls
CAR-zeledon1-0502	because that's how they treat them
AME-zeledon1-0503	wow
CAR-zeledon1-0504	and i've had you know several problems with several customers
CAR-zeledon1-0505	because it's ridiculous that it because of the customer always being right
CAR-zeledon1-0507	you you let someone disrespect you
AME-zeledon1-0508	exactly
CAR-zeledon1-0509	forget it
CAR-zeledon1-0511	for me to me respect is always first
AME-zeledon1-0512	and what do you do like
CAR-zeledon1-0513	no i confront them like
AME-zeledon1-0514	when they
CAR-zeledon1-0515	this um last sunday what happened was that the customer walks in right
CAR-zeledon1-0516	so so i you know i took care of him whatever
CAR-zeledon1-0517	i did his sandwiches
CAR-zeledon1-0518	and he was with i guess his parents
AME-zeledon1-0519	o k
CAR-zeledon1-0520	two elderly people that's like a couple husband and wife
AME-zeledon1-0521	o k
CAR-zeledon1-0522	i'm guessing it's his parents whatever
AME-zeledon1-0523	o k
CAR-zeledon1-0524	so um they walk in whatever
CAR-zeledon1-0525	i took care of them i
CAR-zeledon1-0526	you know i made them sandwiches
CAR-zeledon1-0527	and then we used to give out our courtesy cups for water
CAR-zeledon1-0529	just because it it doesn't happen in every subway
AME-zeledon1-0530	right
CAR-zeledon1-0531	it it all depends on the owner
AME-zeledon1-0532	o k
CAR-zeledon1-0533	if the owner wants to do it
CAR-zeledon1-0535	or the manager you know
CAR-zeledon1-0536	if they approve it
AME-zeledon1-0537	right
CAR-zeledon1-0538	and what was happening is that people weren't you know taking water
CAR-zeledon1-0539	they were actually taking soda from the fountain machine
AME-zeledon1-0540	oh
CAR-zeledon1-0541	and that's a loss for us
AME-zeledon1-0542	right
CAR-zeledon1-0543	in money daily
CAR-zeledon1-0544	so what we did was we you know we weren't we weren't um gonna give out courtesy cups any more
AME-zeledon1-0545	right
CAR-zeledon1-0546	so this man comes you know last sunday whatever
CAR-zeledon1-0547	when i go to charge him he asks me for three courtesy cups
CAR-zeledon1-0548	and i tell him i'm because he was used to going whatever and getting the cups
CAR-zeledon1-0549	and i tell him sorry sir but we're no longer giving you know courtesy cups
CAR-zeledon1-0550	because we've had several issues with several clients
CAR-zeledon1-0552	and we're not doing it any more
CAR-zeledon1-0553	and then so he responded to me he said
CAR-zeledon1-0554	let me just remember like the exact words
CAR-zeledon1-0555	he goes to me he goes
CAR-zeledon1-0556	so what am i supposed to do drink water out of my hands
CAR-zeledon1-0557	like with that you know with sarcasm
AME-zeledon1-0558	right right right
CAR-zeledon1-0559	and i was already upset at something
CAR-zeledon1-0561	so i went off on him
CAR-zeledon1-0562	i told him
CAR-zeledon1-0563	well if you wanna drink water out of your hands like an animal go ahead be my guest that's not my problem
CAR-zeledon1-0565	i don't care
CAR-zeledon1-0566	now if you wanna drink like a normal human being you know like an educated person
AME-zeledon1-0567	just ask for a soda right up
CAR-zeledon1-0568	you buy one of these cups which are you know the paper cups
AME-zeledon1-0569	right
CAR-zeledon1-0570	these paper cups are the ones that you have to purchase for soda
CAR-zeledon1-0572	and i'm gonna have to charge you as if you were buying a soda
AME-zeledon1-0573	right
CAR-zeledon1-0574	ah this is ridiculous
CAR-zeledon1-0575	i told him yeah
CAR-zeledon1-0576	it might be ridiculous to you but you know what the word courtesy means
CAR-zeledon1-0577	that's up to us if we wanna give it for free or not
AME-zeledon1-0578	exactly it's uh optional
CAR-zeledon1-0579	it's optional
AME-zeledon1-0580	right
CAR-zeledon1-0581	it's not like subway is obligating us to give out courtesy
CAR-zeledon1-0582	because the word says it all courtesy cups
CAR-zeledon1-0584	i had it out with the guy i had it out with the guy
AME-zeledon1-0585	how old was he like
AME-zeledon1-0586	he was like a teenager
CAR-zeledon1-0587	what
AME-zeledon1-0588	he was like a teenager or something
CAR-zeledon1-0589	no he was a grown up and like forty seven year old fifty year old man
AME-zeledon1-0590	oh my gosh
AME-zeledon1-0591	i can't believe
CAR-zeledon1-0592	and that's when i told him that i didn't appreciate him disrespecting me that i didn't you know appreciate neither was i gonna tolerate his sarcasm
AME-zeledon1-0593	right
CAR-zeledon1-0594	because i find it ridiculous that you would talk to you know a a working person an employee like that
AME-zeledon1-0595	right
CAR-zeledon1-0596	and then he asked me to speak he wanted to speak to the manager and i told him that i was the owner so then
CAR-zeledon1-0598	there was nothing he could do about it
AME-zeledon1-0599	exactly well that's good at least
CAR-zeledon1-0600	and i told him
CAR-zeledon1-0601	it's either you learn to respect and accept you know the things that are going on
CAR-zeledon1-0602	i was actually pretty nice you know to you when i tried to tell you that we had no cups any more
AME-zeledon1-0603	to explain right
CAR-zeledon1-0604	you know i'm actually giving you an explanation when i don't have to give you an explanation if i don't want to
CAR-zeledon1-0605	and you respond to me you know aggressively and with sarcasm
AME-zeledon1-0606	right
CAR-zeledon1-0607	i'm not gonna tolerate that
CAR-zeledon1-0608	if you like that you can stay
CAR-zeledon1-0609	you can buy a cup
CAR-zeledon1-0610	and you know you're more than welcome to be our client
CAR-zeledon1-0612	we actually appreciate your business whatever
CAR-zeledon1-0613	but if not there's a million subways out there
CAR-zeledon1-0615	if you really like subway you can find another one
AME-zeledon1-0616	oh my god i can't believe it

MAR-maria30-0001	well maybe partially because a lot of of the boy scout leaders are
MAR-maria30-0002	i mean and it it sounds
MAR-maria30-0003	and i and i'm making this up i might be
MAR-maria30-0004	but my theory would be it's men
MAR-maria30-0005	and so they think
MAR-maria30-0006	you know
MAR-maria30-0007	right right right they figure the guys are good swimmers good boaters good whatever
MAR-maria30-0008	you know
MAR-maria30-0009	right
MAR-maria30-0010	you know
MAR-maria30-0011	and then that the parents that are going the leaders are just as you know as forthcoming in their knowledge whereas maybe they're thinking that the women are not as
MAR-maria30-0012	that that's my theory you know
MAR-maria30-0013	they do require that you know one of our leaders must be you know certified you know those kind of things that those
MAR-maria30-0014	most of us aren't you know
MAR-maria30-0015	we don't
MAR-maria30-0016	but
MAR-maria30-0017	hey bob
MAR-maria30-0018	a question for you
MAR-maria30-0019	who's our commissioning agent for f k k a
MAR-maria30-0020	is it us because it's under fifty thousand
MAR-maria30-0021	right right right
MAR-maria30-0022	but then for for the prerequisite
MAR-maria30-0023	are we are we doing an enhance or just prerequisite for florida keys
MAR-maria30-0024	the engineer of record as long as they're not on the team
MAR-maria30-0025	right
MAR-maria30-0026	but i think if it's under fifty thousand square feet it can be done by one of the engineer's designers
MAR-maria30-0027	which is another presentation i went to yesterday
MAR-maria30-0028	it was by a company called spinnaker group that does
MAR-maria30-0029	they're doing the
MAR-maria30-0030	right right it's a prerequisite
MAR-maria30-0031	well actually somebody asked that question
MAR-maria30-0032	and he said in theory it could the fundamental commissioning could be a different person than the enhance
MAR-maria30-0033	it usually never happens
MAR-maria30-0034	but he said it could in theory it could be two different
MAR-maria30-0035	agents
MAR-maria30-0036	well that's what what he said is that because they have something else it turns out that you end up only being able to have one tinkling noise
MAR-maria30-0037	but he said it that in theory you could have one a piece
MAR-maria30-0038	but because you have this other requirement then you end up with only having being able to get one commissioning agent
MAR-maria30-0039	he said it makes no sense
MAR-maria30-0040	but that's kinda what you know what happens
MAR-maria30-0041	you know that if you read them individually it could be two different teams
MAR-maria30-0042	but because then you have this other requirement
MAR-maria30-0043	i can't remember what he said
MAR-maria30-0044	he says you end up having to be able you know only use one
MAR-maria30-0045	woo hoo
MAR-maria30-0046	mona did kurt talk to you about the
MAR-maria30-0048	let me answer him
MAR-maria30-0049	colored pencils
MAR-maria30-0050	no they don't keep them over here
MAR-maria30-0052	no
MAR-maria30-0054	yeah
MAR-maria30-0056	right
MAR-maria30-0057	oh
MAR-maria30-0061	just out of curiosity
MAR-maria30-0062	no
MAR-maria30-0063	i have to agree with that
MAR-maria30-0064	o k marta tell me if this is too long
MAR-maria30-0065	for the girls yes
MAR-maria30-0066	actually i wanna add a section on women architecture
MAR-maria30-0067	but i haven't done that yet
MAR-maria30-0068	i made it
MAR-maria30-0069	now this one this is an autocad drawing
MAR-maria30-0071	i've just traced it because your stupid girl scout website doesn't give you the ability to download a decent tinkling noise
MAR-maria30-0072	no
MAR-maria30-0073	and i think i can
MAR-maria30-0074	i i ungrouped it so i'll send it to you if you want to use it

MAR-maria30-0267	eh yeah it's not um no
MAR-maria30-0268	i mean well actually it should be
MAR-maria30-0269	because because the owner only gave us one freaking copy
MAR-maria30-0270	took us what fifteen months to get it
MAR-maria30-0271	and well fifteen months is an exaggeration
MAR-maria30-0272	but you get the point
MAR-maria30-0273	uh so it was the copies for the owner copies for the contractor copies for us copy for mechanical so it
MAR-maria30-0274	the the the c c t v the security cameras coordination
MAR-maria30-0275	right
MAR-maria30-0276	right
MAR-maria30-0277	contractor
MAR-maria30-0278	and they were
MAR-maria30-0279	right this was the one from prices so they needed copies
MAR-maria30-0280	so it should be reimbursable
MAR-maria30-0281	we should charge em for that one
MAR-maria30-0283	oh that's nice
MAR-maria30-0284	looks good
MAR-maria30-0285	yes my favorite he's awesome
MAR-maria30-0286	he could draw
MAR-maria30-0287	josef hoffmann couldn't draw
MAR-maria30-0288	but he could draw
MAR-maria30-0289	we went to when i was in europe to um the paris
MAR-maria30-0290	one of the first exhibits that they had of of the modernism

MAR-maria30-0292	nineteen hundred paris called nineteen hundred
MAR-maria30-0293	and it was in paris in the pompidou
MAR-maria30-0294	this was twenty years
MAR-maria30-0295	it was one of the first exhibits it was like a comprehensive exhibit of that earlier and the precursor to the modernism
MAR-maria30-0296	and um they had a whole section on the secession
MAR-maria30-0297	you know otto wagner josef hoffmann
MAR-maria30-0298	and you know he did a lot of work
MAR-maria30-0299	he couldn't draw if his life depended on it
MAR-maria30-0300	yeah his sketches were like
MAR-maria30-0301	and my best fried goes
MAR-maria30-0302	oh there's hope for me yet
MAR-maria30-0303	if he can draw
MAR-maria30-0304	you know and then otto wagner's drawings were just like ahhh you know
MAR-maria30-0305	but hoffmann's he's the one who
MAR-maria30-0306	he's the one that did all those beautiful round buildings
MAR-maria30-0307	you know he wasn't he was a little bit less busy than than than wagner
MAR-maria30-0308	she but he couldn't
MAR-maria30-0309	i mean and he did like restaurants
MAR-maria30-0310	and he even did
MAR-maria30-0311	he had sketches for the menu for the for the silverware the flatware the furniture
MAR-maria30-0312	i mean it was a comprehensive like it used to be but he couldn't draw worth a damn
MAR-maria30-0313	you know they were like you know fifth grader drawings laughs
MAR-maria30-0314	draw by hand
MAR-maria30-0315	ah yes i have
MAR-maria30-0316	he still follows the old fashioned
MAR-maria30-0317	he's just the the pritzker he's just got an award the pritzker i think he's just had the pritzker
MAR-maria30-0318	santiago calatrava
MAR-maria30-0319	calatrava still draws like that
MAR-maria30-0320	oh really
MAR-maria30-0321	i didn't know that either
MAR-maria30-0322	well calatrava's like that
MAR-maria30-0323	he draws
MAR-maria30-0324	you weren't here
MAR-maria30-0325	well you were downstairs when i came back from the las vegas
MAR-maria30-0326	five
MAR-maria30-0327	he was the gold medalist for the a i a national convention about three years ago
MAR-maria30-0328	so he was the speaker
MAR-maria30-0329	usually the gold medalist they try to have them you know speak at one of the sessions on saturday
MAR-maria30-0330	and you know it's he he pulls out
MAR-maria30-0331	you know he starts talking about you know
MAR-maria30-0332	and actually he's a really really humble person
MAR-maria30-0333	you know how some of these people they're just like
MAR-maria30-0334	he was like he was so honored to have gotten it that
MAR-maria30-0335	you know he was like in awe that all these people thought his work was really good
MAR-maria30-0336	that he
MAR-maria30-0337	i think he has an office in new york or he's living and he said that you know the americans are
MAR-maria30-0338	so i mean he was
MAR-maria30-0339	i mean i was like oh my god this is a real person
MAR-maria30-0340	you know not you know
MAR-maria30-0341	tsk and so he starts talking about the design ideas
MAR-maria30-0342	and how he uh
MAR-maria30-0343	like the the milwaukee art museum you know how
MAR-maria30-0344	and he starts to draw with watercolors
MAR-maria30-0345	he had you know they had the overhead projector
MAR-maria30-0346	five thousand people the it's projecting you know half this room
MAR-maria30-0347	and he's just and he's just
MAR-maria30-0349	and i'm going
MAR-maria30-0350	oh my god
MAR-maria30-0351	i mean
MAR-maria30-0352	not only that not only that it's like
MAR-maria30-0353	he wasn't in
MAR-maria30-0354	i mean he was nervous speaking
MAR-maria30-0355	you could tell he was nervous speaking
MAR-maria30-0356	you know which was kinda like endearing
MAR-maria30-0357	because you know you could tell he was like
MAR-maria30-0358	oh my god
MAR-maria30-0359	but the minute he started drawing and talking about the ideas as he draw as he drew the nervousness was gone
MAR-maria30-0360	i mean he was in his element
MAR-maria30-0361	this was his passion
MAR-maria30-0362	and he's just drawing
MAR-maria30-0363	and i'm thinking
MAR-maria30-0364	and you're not nervous drawing in front of five thousand architects
MAR-maria30-0365	you know you're my hero buddy you know
MAR-maria30-0366	you know it the good his work uh i have a book downstairs of his stuff that i bought
MAR-maria30-0367	because he's an engineer as well
MAR-maria30-0368	he was he he was really good
MAR-maria30-0369	um
MAR-maria30-0370	um
MAR-maria30-0371	right
MAR-maria30-0372	no the boy boy scouts is just as tough as the girl scouts
MAR-maria30-0373	the thing is i i would argue i would i suggest i would venture to suggest that many of the troops do things they just don't tell the council they're doing
MAR-maria30-0375	does that make sense
MAR-maria30-0377	right in our case because we're through the the the the church then you know it's not you personal
MAR-maria30-0378	you know we we we have the the church
MAR-maria30-0379	we do make them sign a release a a permission slip when we go anywhere
MAR-maria30-0380	and half the kids don't give it to me
MAR-maria30-0381	and i scream and bitch at them
MAR-maria30-0382	and they're going to camping this next weekend at peace river which is a river up um
MAR-maria30-0383	that you one of those where they drop you at one end
MAR-maria30-0384	and and with the canoe you canoe
MAR-maria30-0385	it's like twenty three miles down uh north of of fort myers or one of those places
MAR-maria30-0386	and i told the kids
MAR-maria30-0387	o k this isn't like we're camping around the corner where your parents can come get you
MAR-maria30-0388	if i don't have a permission slip you are not going
MAR-maria30-0389	i don't care how old you are
MAR-maria30-0390	i don't care if you're a senior in high school
MAR-maria30-0391	you are not going
MAR-maria30-0392	they're like
MAR-maria30-0393	o k maria o k o k
MAR-maria30-0394	because they'd get lax
MAR-maria30-0395	they've gotten used to to four of the kids with slips giving permission slip because it was the camping was down the street
MAR-maria30-0396	and mom and dad were going
MAR-maria30-0397	i just said
MAR-maria30-0398	i don't care if your parents are going or not taps
MAR-maria30-0399	i want a permission slip taps
MAR-maria30-0400	right but in this case we are going out of town taps
MAR-maria30-0401	we are going on a very rustic taps
MAR-maria30-0402	i mean you have to camp with you bring what you got taps
MAR-maria30-0403	and you take out what you brought taps
MAR-maria30-0404	peace river
MAR-maria30-0405	no
MAR-maria30-0406	hello i i gave em
MAR-maria30-0407	i said
MAR-maria30-0408	we're not around the corner taps
MAR-maria30-0409	i want a permission slip taps
MAR-maria30-0410	and i said
MAR-maria30-0411	from now on anytime we go anywhere and it's camping you all have a permission slip none of you are going taps
MAR-maria30-0414	all of them have gotten away with it for years
MAR-maria30-0415	and they think they'll just keep doing it
MAR-maria30-0416	yeah we have that too
MAR-maria30-0417	oh but they don't give you one they don't give you one
MAR-maria30-0418	see our application form the back of the application form says the name gets sent to the council has all the medical history on the back
MAR-maria30-0419	and we keep it on file tinkling noise
MAR-maria30-0420	o k henry had a little too many things to

MAR-maria30-0422	alright
MAR-maria30-0423	but why we certainly understand the challenges of finishes this project within the scheduled types
MAR-maria30-0424	time frame types
MAR-maria30-0425	time frame types
MAR-maria30-0426	but i find it difficult to believe that all the kitchen equipment that must be manufactured in several finished panels will delay production types
MAR-maria30-0427	but in the types
MAR-maria30-0428	in interest of fairness we are not the production company types
MAR-maria30-0429	in the future please contact our office immediately types

MAR-maria30-0465	i haven't even read it
MAR-maria30-0466	i'm answering without reading
MAR-maria30-0467	i will read it
MAR-maria30-0468	and
MAR-maria30-0469	i were out
MAR-maria30-0470	no we weren't out there on three twenty-five we were on three twenty-four
MAR-maria30-0471	we were out on site to review texture mockup on three twenty-five twenty-four tsk types
MAR-maria30-0472	we did mention the requirement of color approval types
MAR-maria30-0473	because a paint chip is never the same as the real thing with sun and materials types
MAR-maria30-0474	as part of the mixture types
MAR-maria30-0475	do we need a a mockup for the inside
MAR-maria30-0476	just so you understand our interest in the exterior color mockup at a u a u v types
MAR-maria30-0477	the original colors we selected did not turn out like we thought types
MAR-maria30-0478	and therefore had to select different colors types
MAR-maria30-0479	we do not want to come out to types
MAR-maria30-0480	to know when we can come and review colors mumbles types
MAR-maria30-0481	are you sure we
MAR-maria30-0482	i don't think we did exterior interior
MAR-maria30-0483	do we need them
MAR-maria30-0484	let's go ahead and look at it
MAR-maria30-0485	because some of the interiors at a u v i would have lived without of happily
MAR-maria30-0486	like that that um bonafide beige
MAR-maria30-0487	you can't see it
MAR-maria30-0488	you can't
MAR-maria30-0489	o k sighs
MAR-maria30-0490	he cancelled
MAR-maria30-0491	o k
MAR-maria30-0492	just so you understand our interest in exterior colors reads
MAR-maria30-0493	the mockup at a u v did not turn out like we thought and reads
MAR-maria30-0494	we are positive that reads
MAR-maria30-0495	eh i'm just trying to give it a positive spin here tinkling noise
MAR-maria30-0496	that types
MAR-maria30-0497	all of us working together will result in a successful project delivered on time types
MAR-maria30-0499	how's that
MAR-maria30-0500	um i am told that the paint sample for every everyday white did not match the intended color types
MAR-maria30-0501	and we ask for resubmittal types
MAR-maria30-0502	i'm leaving a little early but
MAR-maria30-0503	uh one thirty tim washington's coming here
MAR-maria30-0504	to review
MAR-maria30-0505	i'm just signing a pay out
MAR-maria30-0506	do we need to say anything else
MAR-maria30-0507	it did not match the intended color correct
MAR-maria30-0508	it's not a new color
MAR-maria30-0509	it is not a new color types
MAR-maria30-0510	what did they just didn't paint it correctly or didn't look right
MAR-maria30-0511	but do we know
MAR-maria30-0512	oh because they're not using the same
MAR-maria30-0513	ah it is not a color types
MAR-maria30-0514	it is simply a simply a different manufacturer a different shade by a different manufacturer different shade by a different manufacturer types
MAR-maria30-0515	hence the painting sub needs to match the basis of design types
MAR-maria30-0516	how's that types
MAR-maria30-0517	you wanna put something yes
MAR-maria30-0518	what did you want me how did you want me to answer that
MAR-maria30-0519	oops
MAR-maria30-0520	what was missing
MAR-maria30-0521	uhhuh
MAR-maria30-0522	uhhuh
MAR-maria30-0523	uhhuh
MAR-maria30-0524	o k let me ask you a stupid question
MAR-maria30-0525	why did we took why did we took so long to give it back to them
MAR-maria30-0526	i thought we picked the colors a long long time ago
MAR-maria30-0527	so why are they saying they just got it this week
MAR-maria30-0528	but we discovered that it wasn't right weeks ago
MAR-maria30-0529	no it was more than that
MAR-maria30-0530	longer than two weeks
MAR-maria30-0531	longer than last week
MAR-maria30-0532	i thought it was longer than that
MAR-maria30-0533	well then let's leave it alone
MAR-maria30-0534	because we
MAR-maria30-0536	you would've had it mumbles
MAR-maria30-0537	so what you're telling me this
MAR-maria30-0538	updated
MAR-maria30-0539	but we've selected those colors a long time ago
MAR-maria30-0540	why had we never updated this
MAR-maria30-0541	and we still didn't read our a s i
MAR-maria30-0542	no no i'll tell you what happened
MAR-maria30-0543	this is a legend being xrefed from a different file
MAR-maria30-0544	she fixed the legend at w
MAR-maria30-0545	but it was still xrefing at non w
MAR-maria30-0546	i bet that's what happened
MAR-maria30-0547	bet you a million dollars
MAR-maria30-0548	because i have found plenty legends that refers to not it it's own w folder but back to the original
MAR-maria30-0549	back to the original uh
MAR-maria30-0550	do you see what i'm saying
MAR-maria30-0551	because there's no way
MAR-maria30-0552	there is no technology
MAR-maria30-0553	then it's referring to the wrong folder
MAR-maria30-0554	no no no but i'm saying it's
MAR-maria30-0555	she changed this
MAR-maria30-0556	you know she changed it two days before
MAR-maria30-0557	when that new drawing was opened
MAR-maria30-0558	i did guarantee you it's that that it was referring to
MAR-maria30-0559	well then then i go back to my usual statement
MAR-maria30-0560	people need to look at these things before they're released
MAR-maria30-0561	because they've not looked they've not looked
MAR-maria30-0562	because if i know i've changed a legend
MAR-maria30-0563	because i know when i change a legend and i go back to the drawing i look to make sure that it's uploaded it
MAR-maria30-0564	and when i haven't did when i've discovered that it's not then i change the legend
MAR-maria30-0565	and it doesn't
MAR-maria30-0566	and i'll go
MAR-maria30-0567	who the hell
MAR-maria30-0568	and then i go in the xref
MAR-maria30-0569	and it's referring the same folder name but under a different project
MAR-maria30-0570	then we then we do need to bring it in
MAR-maria30-0571	that's o k
MAR-maria30-0572	we do need to let we just
MAR-maria30-0573	we just need to we just need to make sure that staff realizes when you update a legend make sure it's referring to the folder it's supposed to
MAR-maria30-0574	because when you stole that legend from another folder a lot of times we forget
MAR-maria30-0575	you know what i'm saying
MAR-maria30-0576	particularly because we borrowed all these drawings
MAR-maria30-0577	so we may have plain and simply forgotten to change the paths
MAR-maria30-0578	it was a different path
MAR-maria30-0579	leave it alone leave it alone because that means we really screwed up
MAR-maria30-0580	i'm not gonna win so
MAR-maria30-0581	and i'm not gonna win
MAR-maria30-0582	not gonna win that one
MAR-maria30-0583	so i'm gonna let them have it
MAR-maria30-0584	so what's his problem on this northeast person
MAR-maria30-0585	make him worth his while right
MAR-maria30-0586	what'd they do
MAR-maria30-0587	they
MAR-maria30-0588	oh they definitely definitely
MAR-maria30-0589	because we pick on each other for work quite never that uh
MAR-maria30-0590	we're never on the cruel
MAR-maria30-0591	we we stop beyond getting too cruel
MAR-maria30-0592	then i perhaps mister alvaro rodriguez was not off the market at all
MAR-maria1-0002	she she is a linguist
MAR-maria1-0003	and so she wants to sort of track you know spanglish
MAR-maria1-0004	so she asked me if i would wear it at work
MAR-maria1-0006	so if you see me with this thing i look kinda goofy
MAR-maria1-0008	you know the tiny little one
MAR-maria1-0009	and then if you know
MAR-maria1-0010	she has um some sort of program cause she is doing you know
MAR-maria1-0011	she's got like a grant or something
MAR-maria1-0012	yeah and they transcribe it
MAR-maria1-0014	right right
MAR-maria1-0018	so
MAR-maria1-0038	it's really pretty actually when you
MAR-maria1-0039	i think it's before gainesville
MAR-maria1-0040	i think it's before gainesville
MAR-maria1-0041	when you when you drive on seventy five
MAR-maria1-0042	i think it's seventy five
MAR-maria1-0043	it's real pretty
MAR-maria1-0045	it's horse country
MAR-maria1-0046	you see the big
MAR-maria1-0051	so you see the big properties with you know you know the trees
MAR-maria1-0052	and you know you see the horses
MAR-maria1-0053	it's very pretty actually i mean
MAR-maria1-0057	good job dear
MAR-maria1-0060	right it is so cute
MAR-maria1-0061	it's very cute
MAR-maria1-0066	laughs
MAR-maria1-0068	very cute
MAR-maria1-0078	so it doesn't get any sun
MAR-maria1-0084	you can call it this laughs
MAR-maria1-0093	right right right right right right right
MAR-maria1-0134	we get no direct sun we get
MAR-maria1-0139	he doesn't miss it in other words
MAR-maria1-0142	that's what they said about five years
MAR-maria1-0146	you heat it
MAR-maria1-0148	thirty six
MAR-maria1-0154	maybe
MAR-maria1-0155	no cause it has a sensor
MAR-maria1-0156	and the sensor is on on the dashboard
MAR-maria1-0157	so i guess it takes it
MAR-maria1-0158	in the the one i think i'm i i mean this car provides heat
MAR-maria1-0160	the only way i can turn the heat is i have to tell it auto
MAR-maria1-0161	and turn the temperature up
MAR-maria1-0162	because then the sensor will know that is cold outside and it throws hot air like you don't you can have
MAR-maria1-0163	and it takes time
MAR-maria1-0164	versus the old fashion you turn the knob to the red
MAR-maria1-0165	when the car is warm it throws hot air
MAR-maria1-0166	it takes time because engine the engine is your engine's too cold
MAR-maria1-0168	where is the heat
MAR-maria1-0169	you know
MAR-maria1-0170	and then
MAR-maria1-0171	right
MAR-maria1-0172	because it's auto
MAR-maria1-0173	electrical
MAR-maria1-0174	right
MAR-maria1-0176	you can hit on
MAR-maria1-0177	and you turn the you know you
MAR-maria1-0178	i don't like i don't like that that they do the
MAR-maria1-0179	it's kinda weird
MAR-maria1-0180	i don't like it
MAR-maria1-0181	i mean i like the old fashion knobs
MAR-maria1-0182	brrru *
MAR-maria1-0183	you know laughs
MAR-maria1-0184	right
MAR-maria1-0185	i mean it warms up
MAR-maria1-0186	but it's weird
MAR-maria1-0187	it's it's it's it's not it's counter-intuitive because you're used to saying o k i want warm
MAR-maria1-0199	so when i got in the car yesterday i went
MAR-maria1-0200	oh
MAR-maria1-0201	mine has it too

LUK-herring9-0090	just click on it
LUK-herring9-0091	ok whisper
LUK-herring9-0092	now someone show me
LUK-herring9-0093	how we're fixing please
LUK-herring9-0094	i will do this good
LUK-herring9-0095	because i have no way of
LUK-herring9-0096	i'm not gonna
LUK-herring9-0097	where's the home
LUK-herring9-0098	er it's a different person
LUK-herring9-0099	it's a different guy asking
LUK-herring9-0100	ok because i said
LUK-herring9-0101	close it
LUK-herring9-0102	because i somebody asking about how to wire the foglights in the car so that they come on on their own
CLA-herring9-0103	delete it
LUK-herring9-0104	yep
LUK-herring9-0106	yeah clear them out
LUK-herring9-0107	because jared jared says
LUK-herring9-0108	maybe he doesn't know
LUK-herring9-0109	because maybe he says he just pays for everything
LUK-herring9-0110	maybe he doesn't know
LUK-herring9-0111	but he says that his installer guy got the windows to go up and down with the remote with the alarm
LUK-herring9-0112	i'm thinking that the the installer just charged them for the for the modules
LUK-herring9-0113	so maybe they'll go up and down
LUK-herring9-0114	and he doesn't know
LUK-herring9-0115	what he's saying that it's without putting the the modules
LUK-herring9-0116	i think that he's wrong
LUK-herring9-0117	because
CLA-herring9-0118	hey oh on the
LUK-herring9-0119	yeah the because the thing is if if they have one
CLA-herring9-0120	but but they charge him a hell of a lot of money
CLA-herring9-0121	so it the he it probably is included in the price
LUK-herring9-0122	alright
LUK-herring9-0123	ok
LUK-herring9-0124	he
CLA-herring9-0125	he had to put it in this thing right
LUK-herring9-0126	i can do it
LUK-herring9-0127	i can do it with this ones too
LUK-herring9-0128	so that means that there's a little connection that lets me do it with this key
CLA-herring9-0129	you wanna rewire or
LUK-herring9-0130	ok he says that the guy moved the connection from this receiver to this receiver
LUK-herring9-0131	ok
CLA-herring9-0132	how the hell can you move it from one receiver to the other
LUK-herring9-0133	because there's a receiver in the car that receives signals from this remote
LUK-herring9-0134	and then it turn it it makes the the the motors on the on the windows go down
LUK-herring9-0135	he just unplugged that from that receiver
LUK-herring9-0136	and plugged it into the auxiliary receiver on the on the module for this one
LUK-herring9-0137	because i can plug in whatever i want to it
LUK-herring9-0139	the point is i need to find the cables i want to plug in
LUK-herring9-0140	and plug it in to this thing ok
LUK-herring9-0141	that's what he said the guy did
LUK-herring9-0142	no everybody's like
LUK-herring9-0143	oh i don't know how to do this
LUK-herring9-0144	impossible
LUK-herring9-0145	it's difficult
CLA-herring9-0146	not impossible that's doable
LUK-herring9-0147	you know what you do is you buy the modules fifty bucks each
LUK-herring9-0148	and they let you control
LUK-herring9-0149	and then add it onto this
LUK-herring9-0150	but then i would have to like run wires through each door
LUK-herring9-0151	and so it's a pain in the ass to install too
LUK-herring9-0152	besides the fact that it's you know the fifty bucks each
LUK-herring9-0153	then installation is even more
CLA-herring9-0154	so it's it's gonna be two hundred bucks
LUK-herring9-0155	it's only let me see
LUK-herring9-0156	ok let me go down
CLA-herring9-0157	i thought they were going to keep windows
LUK-herring9-0158	i didn't know you could roll them back up
LUK-herring9-0159	mine doesn't roll them back up
LUK-herring9-0160	but i don't know if somebody says so
CLA-herring9-0161	didn't jared say he could do that too
LUK-herring9-0162	yeah that's what i'm saying
LUK-herring9-0163	i didn't think he'd put a module
LUK-herring9-0164	because i can't put it up and down
LUK-herring9-0165	and my car just and the car just goes on
LUK-herring9-0166	and you know what i noticed
LUK-herring9-0167	if i had the car
CLA-herring9-0168	yeah
LUK-herring9-0169	on it won't work any more
LUK-herring9-0170	the car has to be off for it to come now
CLA-herring9-0171	ok
LUK-herring9-0172	i guess it's not designed to work without a start with a remote start
LUK-herring9-0173	do you want to delete that
LUK-herring9-0174	and then see what's in my junk
LUK-herring9-0175	you need to see my junk
CLA-herring9-0176	ok just delete it
LUK-herring9-0177	yeah click on the arrow next to the junk too
LUK-herring9-0178	there we go
LUK-herring9-0179	isn't that just intuitive the arrow
CLA-herring9-0180	whatever no i have a mine is better
LUK-herring9-0181	ok you can log me out

LUK-herring9-0191	oh i i i'm gonna ask him when he gets back
LUK-herring9-0192	because i think it's funny

LUK-herring9-0196	see if you know
CLA-herring9-0197	welsh
CLA-herring9-0198	no english

CLA-herring9-0201	ok baby
LUK-herring9-0202	i think it's flemish
CLA-herring9-0203	ok darling
LUK-herring9-0205	you know how many languages they got there
LUK-herring9-0206	hello
CLA-herring9-0207	is this another family guy reference
LUK-herring9-0208	no that's from finding nemo
LUK-herring9-0209	what she was speaking
LUK-herring9-0210	does that sound a little orca to you
CLA-herring9-0211	oh my god
CLA-herring9-0213	ok
CLA-herring9-0215	i went to all the websites today
CLA-herring9-0216	i had so much i wanted to show you
LUK-herring9-0217	yeah you did everything except what you were supposed to do
CLA-herring9-0218	i know
LUK-herring9-0219	well i'm disappointed in you
CLA-herring9-0220	as usual
LUK-herring9-0221	and now the people in wales are going to find out that i'm disappointed on my fiancé
CLA-herring9-0222	ah
LUK-herring9-0223	and they're gonna think that the students from from f i u are not good students
LUK-herring9-0227	well he he said to keep talking
LUK-herring9-0228	but it doesn't say anywhere that we can't adjust the microphones
CLA-herring9-0230	oh my god
LUK-herring9-0231	anyways
CLA-herring9-0232	you're so annoying sometimes
LUK-herring9-0233	um
CLA-herring9-0234	oh yeah
LUK-herring9-0235	i feel the same way you do about me
CLA-herring9-0236	oh if we go over five thirty
CLA-herring9-0237	oh oh she emailed me back
CLA-herring9-0238	the lady from flamingo gardens
LUK-herring9-0239	and what did she say
CLA-herring9-0240	she said that we can have more than a hundred guests
CLA-herring9-0241	but we're gonna have to pay for their chairs
CLA-herring9-0242	like bring in the chairs from an outside rental
LUK-herring9-0243	so that was the only reason why they said me a maximum of a hundred for the for the fricking chairs
CLA-herring9-0244	yeah because they only had a hundred chairs
LUK-herring9-0245	oh come on
LUK-herring9-0246	that's not our problem
CLA-herring9-0247	uh you what
CLA-herring9-0248	i'm just gonna leave the hundred chairs
CLA-herring9-0249	and the kids can sit on their parents laps
CLA-herring9-0250	or you know do whatever the hell
CLA-herring9-0251	oh and um they don't close down the the park if you have a wedding
CLA-herring9-0252	they it's uh still open to the public
LUK-herring9-0253	i don't like that
CLA-herring9-0254	i don't like that either
CLA-herring9-0255	and if you're in the wedding party you can't go you can't go roam around the park and look at things
LUK-herring9-0256	unless you pay
CLA-herring9-0257	unless you pay the twelve bucks
LUK-herring9-0258	oh it makes sense
LUK-herring9-0259	because you're going for free but
CLA-herring9-0260	well i'm paying like two thousand bucks
LUK-herring9-0261	so then we can't as a wedding party go together looking at things unless we all pay
CLA-herring9-0262	no
CLA-herring9-0263	unless everyone pays
LUK-herring9-0264	that's another dozen hundred dollars
CLA-herring9-0265	she said that she said that you can get the fifteen or more group discount
CLA-herring9-0266	and it'll cost you less money
LUK-herring9-0267	that's so ridiculous over that amount of people
CLA-herring9-0268	hey that's why she said twelve i think instead of
LUK-herring9-0269	yeah but i i
CLA-herring9-0270	because with the group discount you get like like twelve dollars for adults
CLA-herring9-0271	versus seventeen it's a huge difference
LUK-herring9-0272	it's over a hundred dollars less
LUK-herring9-0273	but i don't wanna pay twelve hundred dollars for people to go look at birds
LUK-herring9-0274	in my wedding yeah it's our wedding day
LUK-herring9-0275	they gonna look at us
CLA-herring9-0276	no no no i mean if they wanna walk around they can go on their own
LUK-herring9-0277	and pay
CLA-herring9-0278	i'm not gonna yeah
LUK-herring9-0279	well anyways i just
LUK-herring9-0280	maybe because the last time we went it was right after the eragon
LUK-herring9-0281	and it was all messed up
LUK-herring9-0282	but i really
CLA-herring9-0283	i think by now it should be fixed
LUK-herring9-0284	we need to go back and see
CLA-herring9-0285	look how pretty the gazebo looks
CLA-herring9-0286	did you see it
LUK-herring9-0287	the gays bo
CLA-herring9-0288	oh my god
CLA-herring9-0289	they're gonna be like
CLA-herring9-0290	what the hell are you talking about
CLA-herring9-0291	laugh
LUK-herring9-0293	ah gays bo look it up
CLA-herring9-0294	it's from the teacher reference
CLA-herring9-0295	ignore him
CLA-herring9-0296	ok so flamingo gardens

LUK-herring9-0320	that little girlfriend of mine from birmingham
LUK-herring9-0321	from england
CLA-herring9-0322	ok
LUK-herring9-0323	that online girlfriend of mine
LUK-herring9-0324	i think she either visited wales or she spoke
LUK-herring9-0325	i'm just thinking baby
LUK-herring9-0326	comes to mind now
LUK-herring9-0328	why can't uh can't that come to mind now

LUK-herring9-0330	and that maybe reminded me of her
CLA-herring9-0332	i've put it i typed it in right
LUK-herring9-0333	i wonder if she settled
CLA-herring9-0334	and it didn't go to the website
LUK-herring9-0335	i wonder what ever happened to her
CLA-herring9-0336	why don't you go email her

CLA-herring9-0666	i would like my parents to go
CLA-herring9-0667	because they have never been to that park
CLA-herring9-0668	and it's really lovely
LUK-herring9-0669	yeah that's a whole different story
LUK-herring9-0670	but it has nothing to do with me seeing it to consider whether or not i want it to be a venue for my wedding
CLA-herring9-0671	yeah but we can kill two birds with one stone
CLA-herring9-0672	and spend some time with the family
LUK-herring9-0673	baby

LUK-herring9-0681	do you think when they are listening to these recordings that they're going to listen to both of us at the same time
LUK-herring9-0682	or is it just me just talking one crap and you're talking a completely different crap individually
LUK-herring9-0683	unless they put it together it doesn't really make much sense does it
LUK-herring9-0684	think about it
LUK-herring9-0686	think about it
LUK-herring9-0687	if it's just you saying every so often
LUK-herring9-0689	shut the fuck up shut the fuck

LUK-herring9-0794	and well i suppose he's also gonna do it in spanish
CLA-herring9-0795	i don't know
CLA-herring9-0796	uh well considering
LUK-herring9-0797	is the whole were you planning on the whole wedding being in spanish and not telling me until the day of
CLA-herring9-0798	the the the invitations so far as i have imagined them are in english
CLA-herring9-0799	but then i was thinking everyone in the fucking family speaks spanish
CLA-herring9-0800	what the fuck are we gonna do
CLA-herring9-0801	are we gonna are we gonna send everyone who speaks spanish an english invitation
LUK-herring9-0802	well babe here's the thing
LUK-herring9-0803	they're in america
LUK-herring9-0804	they need to get with the fricking program
LUK-herring9-0805	i am not going to do
CLA-herring9-0806	luke
LUK-herring9-0807	i am not going to do two language invitations
LUK-herring9-0808	because then you're paying two different people two different companies to do
LUK-herring9-0810	no because there's some people like
CLA-herring9-0811	who
LUK-herring9-0812	jessie and and and and davy
CLA-herring9-0813	who got my fifteenth invitation in spanish and knew how to get there

LUK-herring9-0818	does she mean one two three four
LUK-herring9-0819	oh my god
LUK-herring9-0820	are you gonna write well maybe because some of them they actually write the fricking numbers out

LUK-herring9-0822	how about that
CLA-herring9-0823	amore@sita
LUK-herring9-0825	no because i seen some of them that you know they write out the name the numbers
CLA-herring9-0826	you know i i don't wanna do i didn't wanna do it in spanish
CLA-herring9-0827	but it it makes more sense
CLA-herring9-0828	being it's more it's more sensitive to our family situation
LUK-herring9-0829	but then again are we doing this for
CLA-herring9-0830	because i wanted to do that introduction on the top
LUK-herring9-0831	are we gonna do this for our family or for us
CLA-herring9-0832	well obviously it's not for us
LUK-herring9-0833	are we are you and i getting married
LUK-herring9-0834	or is the family getting a party thrown
LUK-herring9-0835	i mean are we throwing a party for the fricking family or for you and me
LUK-herring9-0836	you know i don't wanna do it in spanish
LUK-herring9-0837	because i don't just don't like it
LUK-herring9-0839	that's pretty much the only thing i'll concede i i'll i'll give
LUK-herring9-0840	just because you see it as special
LUK-herring9-0841	i say i love you
CLA-herring9-0843	it doesn't have the same connotation you know
LUK-herring9-0847	but but i don't i don't wanna do
CLA-herring9-0848	this is the gazebo thing
CLA-herring9-0849	look the layout
CLA-herring9-0851	no no no no but it ok i'm not gonna
CLA-herring9-0852	the vows are something personal
CLA-herring9-0853	no one else it doesn't matter if the whole fucking ceremony is in english
LUK-herring9-0854	uh stop with the bad words
CLA-herring9-0855	sorry i'm i'm i'm gone somewhere
LUK-herring9-0856	they're gonna go assuming that all they teach us here is fricking bad words
LUK-herring9-0857	because you said that nasty word which i don't say
CLA-herring9-0859	oh you little laugh
LUK-herring9-0860	laugh
LUK-herring9-0863	you said it several times already
LUK-herring9-0864	and it's just it's inappropriate for a for a petite little lady like yourself
CLA-herring9-0865	ok sweetheart
CLA-herring9-0866	thank you
LUK-herring9-0867	it's uncouth
LUK-herring9-0869	and you are so refined
CLA-herring9-0870	ok
LUK-herring9-0871	my lady
CLA-herring9-0873	it's not
CLA-herring9-0875	and then you have a little
LUK-herring9-0876	you know there was there was a pick up truck called chevy chevrolet camino
CLA-herring9-0877	we would set up the chairs
CLA-herring9-0878	there's also one called nova
LUK-herring9-0879	yeah i know
LUK-herring9-0880	but nova you know supernova that's sounds like an english word
CLA-herring9-0882	ok
LUK-herring9-0883	ok
CLA-herring9-0884	so this would be like the walkway
CLA-herring9-0885	and then you have the different rows of
LUK-herring9-0886	where is it whoops
LUK-herring9-0887	hold on
LUK-herring9-0888	this thing fell
LUK-herring9-0889	ok
CLA-herring9-0890	the different rows of the chairs
CLA-herring9-0891	i found this website that does the the fans right
CLA-herring9-0892	the but like ok
CLA-herring9-0893	there there are rectangular
LUK-herring9-0894	why don't we just put like you know one fan at at the end of each row blowing down
CLA-herring9-0895	no uh the the fans are the paper fans
LUK-herring9-0896	i i know
LUK-herring9-0897	but why don't we do an electric fan that'll actually do it quickly
CLA-herring9-0898	ok
CLA-herring9-0899	they're rectangular
CLA-herring9-0900	ok traditionally what you do is that you give out um a program at the ceremony
LUK-herring9-0901	uhhuh
CLA-herring9-0902	that basically says our names the maid of honour the best man
CLA-herring9-0903	and a a small little
LUK-herring9-0904	from my personal experience that is what i've used as a fan the program
LUK-herring9-0905	i bend it laugh
LUK-herring9-0906	and i kind of fan myself with it
CLA-herring9-0907	ok but when i'm doing that
LUK-herring9-0908	is that that's not our idea right
CLA-herring9-0909	no
LUK-herring9-0910	oh
CLA-herring9-0911	ok
LUK-herring9-0912	could we save money by putting the program onto the face of
CLA-herring9-0913	this is what i'm trying to tell you
LUK-herring9-0914	ok go
CLA-herring9-0915	they have them on on a couple websites where it's a a rectangular thick card stock paper fan
LUK-herring9-0916	oh yeah
CLA-herring9-0917	and then it has a cute little design on there
LUK-herring9-0918	i know
CLA-herring9-0919	little flowers and stuff
LUK-herring9-0920	and you can put the actual program on it
CLA-herring9-0921	and you has it has the program on it
LUK-herring9-0922	that's cool man
CLA-herring9-0923	so it's a it's like a little
LUK-herring9-0924	what let's take it one step forward then once it's that over
LUK-herring9-0925	can you have it
CLA-herring9-0926	those cost more money
LUK-herring9-0927	ah
CLA-herring9-0928	this i can get like
LUK-herring9-0929	yeah but if that's like a fricking piece of cardboard and a and a and a dental dam or whatever
CLA-herring9-0930	yeah and it'll also be about a dollar each
LUK-herring9-0931	a dental thing ah what is it called
CLA-herring9-0932	yeah and a whatever
CLA-herring9-0933	the little stick
CLA-herring9-0934	these are about a dollar each
LUK-herring9-0935	yeah because it's gotta be thick stock
CLA-herring9-0936	or whatever
CLA-herring9-0937	the the the fans that open up
CLA-herring9-0938	the they have these silk ones
CLA-herring9-0939	they have paper ones
CLA-herring9-0940	they have the little wooden ones all of them
LUK-herring9-0941	silk is cool
CLA-herring9-0942	the cheapest one is a dollar fifty each
LUK-herring9-0943	in all the websites i've looked at
CLA-herring9-0944	which is why i wanted you to take me to that chinese store
LUK-herring9-0945	but our but that dollar fifty would that allow you to put enough text to put the whole frigging thing
CLA-herring9-0946	no
LUK-herring9-0947	the whole program
CLA-herring9-0948	it doesn't none of them allow you to put the program on it
LUK-herring9-0949	wow
CLA-herring9-0950	you would have to print it out separately and glue it on or something
LUK-herring9-0951	cool
CLA-herring9-0952	or we can do programs printed out and rolled up into little thingies
CLA-herring9-0953	and then have the fans on top of it
CLA-herring9-0954	because you have uh
CLA-herring9-0955	i think it would be really mean of us to have an outdoor wedding and not be not offer fans
CLA-herring9-0956	for the people
LUK-herring9-0957	well that's why we do it during the cold season
LUK-herring9-0958	so that and we tell everybody
LUK-herring9-0959	bring your own sweaters
CLA-herring9-0960	oh because i wanna have a spring wedding
CLA-herring9-0961	i don't wanna have a winter wedding
CLA-herring9-0962	i don't wanna have a summer wedding
CLA-herring9-0963	i like spring
LUK-herring9-0964	well why don't we do it on a day of spring where the temperatures will be around seventy sixty five degrees
CLA-herring9-0965	sixty five too cold
LUK-herring9-0966	no not once you have all that crap that you're gonna have on you babe
CLA-herring9-0967	i'm not getting a huge poofy dress luke
LUK-herring9-0968	ok then we'll move it up to seventy degrees
LUK-herring9-0969	why don't we do it on a day that's seventy degrees out
CLA-herring9-0970	there's some there'll be a lot of old people
CLA-herring9-0971	old people still can't handle it
LUK-herring9-0972	can't handle what
CLA-herring9-0973	the heat
CLA-herring9-0974	the temperature it's not good for old people
LUK-herring9-0975	seventy degrees is not good for old people what the hell is that

FLA-zeledon8-0890	hey i'll give you a good
MAR-zeledon8-0891	good deal
FLA-zeledon8-0897	ok
FLA-zeledon8-0898	it's twenty five dollars a month
MAR-zeledon8-0899	well they had a better deal then that
FLA-zeledon8-0901	why
MAR-zeledon8-0902	because when when i when i signed up it was hundred and sixteen for the whole year
FLA-zeledon8-0903	i know
FLA-zeledon8-0904	no no it's three hundred and something
MAR-zeledon8-0905	yeah
MAR-zeledon8-0908	that's why
FLA-zeledon8-0909	or i'm gonna talk to her
MAR-zeledon8-0910	or just just tell her yeah
FLA-zeledon8-0911	yeah i'm gonna say
FLA-zeledon8-0913	hey give me
FLA-zeledon8-0914	because i was there for so long
FLA-zeledon8-0915	and then
MAR-zeledon8-0916	yeah
MAR-zeledon8-0917	and and everybody else signed up for that deal
MAR-zeledon8-0921	that that i don't like because it's not
FLA-zeledon8-0923	how how often do they do that like twice a year right
FLA-zeledon8-0924	because sometimes at home i get those bills for you know for ted
MAR-zeledon8-0926	yeah because er the contract is let's say x amount of money
MAR-zeledon8-0928	one sixty let's say
FLA-zeledon8-0929	sixty nine i think it was
MAR-zeledon8-0930	no er whatever
MAR-zeledon8-0940	so
FLA-zeledon8-0942	um yeah
MAR-zeledon8-0943	yeah but in anyway it's a good deal
MAR-zeledon8-0944	it is half of
MAR-zeledon8-0946	but they got all the people that were going to lady of america
FLA-zeledon8-0948	i know
MAR-zeledon8-0949	and now happens that there are too many people
FLA-zeledon8-0950	they have too many people
MAR-zeledon8-0952	so the machines are always occupied
FLA-zeledon8-0953	busy um
MAR-zeledon8-0954	yeah
MAR-zeledon8-0955	and the classes are always full
FLA-zeledon8-0956	really
MAR-zeledon8-0957	which isn't cool in some
FLA-zeledon8-0958	um
MAR-zeledon8-0959	and i think the the the quality of the classes improve
FLA-zeledon8-0960	yes because before they were kinda like empty
MAR-zeledon8-0962	yeah
FLA-zeledon8-0963	and then they didn't have enough people teaching
MAR-zeledon8-0964	and now and the the instructors improve too
FLA-zeledon8-0965	really
FLA-zeledon8-0966	because they didn't have good people before
MAR-zeledon8-0967	yeah
MAR-zeledon8-0973	i i scheduled to stay for two classes because i normally can do that
FLA-zeledon8-0982	i hate aerobics
FLA-zeledon8-0984	i love sculpting
FLA-zeledon8-0986	that's my favourite thing
MAR-zeledon8-0987	but it's like step
FLA-zeledon8-0988	i hate aerobics
MAR-zeledon8-0989	the the first half is step aerobics
MAR-zeledon8-0990	and then it's a
FLA-zeledon8-0991	who's giving that class
MAR-zeledon8-0992	marian
MAR-zeledon8-0993	marian she was in platinum before
FLA-zeledon8-0994	ok
FLA-zeledon8-0996	but they're gonna build another building
FLA-zeledon8-0997	right they're gonna do another building
FLA-zeledon8-0998	what are they doing
MAR-zeledon8-0999	what i'm self-interruption i self-interruption its
FLA-zeledon8-1000	because they're gonna
FLA-zeledon8-1001	what are they doing i don't know
MAR-zeledon8-1002	they were going to self-interruption well
MAR-zeledon8-1003	last time i i heard
MAR-zeledon8-1004	they were they sold all that property
FLA-zeledon8-1005	yeah everything they
MAR-zeledon8-1006	and they are going to build the hilton
MAR-zeledon8-1007	an upscale hilton or or
FLA-zeledon8-1008	marriott
MAR-zeledon8-1009	the marriott yeah
FLA-zeledon8-1010	um
MAR-zeledon8-1011	one of those that's gonna happen
FLA-zeledon8-1012	but on the left or where the gym is
MAR-zeledon8-1013	tsk everywhere because they are going to do a hotel and time-share property
MAR-zeledon8-1014	time-share apartments
FLA-zeledon8-1015	but that's good for us isn't it
MAR-zeledon8-1016	yeah it is good for us
FLA-zeledon8-1017	it is good for us
FLA-zeledon8-1020	part of the hotel
MAR-zeledon8-1021	not
FLA-zeledon8-1022	inside of the hotel
MAR-zeledon8-1023	it will be most likely
MAR-zeledon8-1024	sean we are recording here
FLA-zeledon8-1025	aw don't be mean
FLA-zeledon8-1026	aw ok the gym is gonna be inside like
FLA-zeledon8-1027	it's not gonna be like right now just the gym and the spa
MAR-zeledon8-1028	yeah because what they are doing
MAR-zeledon8-1029	yeah what they're doing trying to do is a resort a complete resort with the golf course and the spa
FLA-zeledon8-1030	but they're gonna be the same owners
FLA-zeledon8-1031	like trishia and dan
MAR-zeledon8-1033	no they didn't they are not renewing the contract
FLA-zeledon8-1035	seegal
MAR-zeledon8-1036	so be careful to what you sign
FLA-zeledon8-1037	aw it's true
MAR-zeledon8-1038	because maybe
FLA-zeledon8-1039	so where are they gonna go
MAR-zeledon8-1040	i don't know whisper
FLA-zeledon8-1041	but after a day deep down i don't understand how that works
MAR-zeledon8-1042	well i think that they run the building
FLA-zeledon8-1043	they're renting that
MAR-zeledon8-1050	i don't know
FLA-zeledon8-1052	who knows
MAR-zeledon8-1053	i i was under the understanding that they rent that from pat seegal
FLA-zeledon8-1054	tsk is it
FLA-zeledon8-1055	i don't know
FLA-zeledon8-1056	probably just the property probably
FLA-zeledon8-1057	and then that's why they can take that thing down and
MAR-zeledon8-1062	but pat but i remember that pat seegal they were going to do that gym with someone else before
MAR-zeledon8-1063	and the
MAR-zeledon8-1065	yeah and the deal fell
MAR-zeledon8-1069	i don't remember
MAR-zeledon8-1071	but i remember there was
FLA-zeledon8-1072	so i don't think that
FLA-zeledon8-1074	gridiron gridiron
FLA-zeledon8-1076	ok
FLA-zeledon8-1078	that is not bad for them
FLA-zeledon8-1082	because she looks older

MAR-maria27-0342	o k
MAR-maria27-0344	there it is
MAR-maria27-0346	that's nice
MAR-maria27-0347	oh since you have that on the wall
MAR-maria27-0349	cork
MAR-maria27-0351	just the basic tone whatever it is
MAR-maria27-0352	right
MAR-maria27-0353	right
MAR-maria27-0354	yeah
MAR-maria27-0358	and this one
MAR-maria27-0359	a wall here
MAR-maria27-0360	this hole
MAR-maria27-0361	where is the wall
MAR-maria27-0362	no no no just graphically i see wall here
MAR-maria27-0363	but i don't see
MAR-maria27-0364	there should be a wall
MAR-maria27-0365	a teacher a wall there
MAR-maria27-0366	i guess some wrong some happened
MAR-maria27-0367	right
MAR-maria27-0368	because this is like a screen
MAR-maria27-0369	but i think
MAR-maria27-0370	yeah i think this is open
MAR-maria27-0371	this is like a
MAR-maria27-0372	so you have to put
MAR-maria27-0373	oh o k
MAR-maria27-0374	o k then graphically is not
MAR-maria27-0375	how i see
MAR-maria27-0376	right
MAR-maria27-0377	and in the back i would maybe put something open the top just all the way across
MAR-maria27-0378	or something
MAR-maria27-0379	because there's equipement back there
MAR-maria27-0380	she may not see it
MAR-maria27-0381	just not gonna see it
MAR-maria27-0382	he may well look ant the the equipment
MAR-maria27-0383	and see what's back there
MAR-maria27-0384	because there is the refrigerators and stuff
MAR-maria27-0385	i mean you can
MAR-maria27-0386	what i would do is do this
MAR-maria27-0387	is this just the grey
MAR-maria27-0388	this is supposed to be
MAR-maria27-0389	there are
MAR-maria27-0390	i mean you i keep the pattern
MAR-maria27-0391	but i wouldn't bother to do this in the back
MAR-maria27-0392	that's what i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0393	they didn't keep that
MAR-maria27-0394	but i
MAR-maria27-0395	by the way have a reveal
MAR-maria27-0396	to do what
MAR-maria27-0397	and how they're making the reveal
MAR-maria27-0398	but the reveal makes no sense
MAR-maria27-0399	will it be all the way around
MAR-maria27-0400	so graphically it's not indicated
MAR-maria27-0401	we don't know who drew this but
MAR-maria27-0402	if there's a reveal to me the reveal is all the way
MAR-maria27-0403	either everywhere or nowhere
MAR-maria27-0404	aha i don't know what this detail
MAR-maria27-0405	i have to look at it
MAR-maria27-0406	where is it
MAR-maria27-0407	ten
MAR-maria27-0408	i mean i
MAR-maria27-0409	let me see whay the plan says
MAR-maria27-0410	let's see
MAR-maria27-0411	on that wall you have
MAR-maria27-0412	well actually you don't have as much
MAR-maria27-0415	it's this wall
MAR-maria27-0416	so you have this equipment here
MAR-maria27-0417	there's
MAR-maria27-0418	things you've open
MAR-maria27-0419	refrigerators
MAR-maria27-0420	and then this stuff
MAR-maria27-0421	and i tell what that stuff is
MAR-maria27-0422	see that stuff is
MAR-maria27-0423	o k
MAR-maria27-0424	this stuff is
MAR-maria27-0425	o k three forty seven is
MAR-maria27-0427	a puller so that's gonna be high
MAR-maria27-0428	three forty five is
MAR-maria27-0430	hiding cabinet
MAR-maria27-0431	these are tall
MAR-maria27-0432	four o two is probably a sink
MAR-maria27-0433	yeah is a work table with something else
MAR-maria27-0434	this is a table so this is low
MAR-maria27-0435	then this is up
MAR-maria27-0437	it's probably high
MAR-maria27-0438	three forty eight
MAR-maria27-0439	yeah past through they're tall
MAR-maria27-0440	there's a hand sink
MAR-maria27-0442	this are to this
MAR-maria27-0443	must be is probably the same arrangement
MAR-maria27-0445	you see here
MAR-maria27-0446	you see here here here here
MAR-maria27-0448	you could see behind the table
MAR-maria27-0449	but this this this equipment are tall
MAR-maria27-0450	so you can do something
MAR-maria27-0451	right that you can see
MAR-maria27-0452	and then this edge you can see
MAR-maria27-0453	and this edge you can see the one
MAR-maria27-0454	right
MAR-maria27-0455	i mean you can you can take it to
MAR-maria27-0456	and stop maybe to the frame
MAR-maria27-0457	stop on the frame
MAR-maria27-0458	and then you can take it from from here to here
MAR-maria27-0459	or maybe it's just this little piece or something
MAR-maria27-0460	right right
MAR-maria27-0461	yeah why doesn't it go all the way through
MAR-maria27-0462	what detail is that number again
MAR-maria27-0463	ten
MAR-maria27-0464	that's there's no such ten
MAR-maria27-0465	there's no such detail
MAR-maria27-0466	how does that work
MAR-maria27-0467	how does that detail work
MAR-maria27-0468	there's no such
MAR-maria27-0469	eight nine
MAR-maria27-0470	but how does that detail work
MAR-maria27-0471	i'm just curious
MAR-maria27-0472	it goes all the way around
MAR-maria27-0473	it sees there are everywhere or nowhere
MAR-maria27-0474	how the hell are they gonna do that
MAR-maria27-0475	not only that
MAR-maria27-0476	you need to tell him
MAR-maria27-0477	oh you they are not gonna do that
MAR-maria27-0478	because you can do this
MAR-maria27-0479	but your edge of your stud is here
MAR-maria27-0480	so you need to add a piece
MAR-maria27-0481	to give it
MAR-maria27-0482	to give
MAR-maria27-0483	yes which means you are gonna add a piece to get that
MAR-maria27-0484	and that
MAR-maria27-0485	no because because
MAR-maria27-0486	think about it hannah
MAR-maria27-0487	here is your your stud
MAR-maria27-0488	and here is your dry wall
MAR-maria27-0489	are you going to are you gonna push
MAR-maria27-0490	beyond the stood
MAR-maria27-0491	well the stud is this way
MAR-maria27-0492	but how are you gonna push beyond the stud
MAR-maria27-0493	but that's not what was drawn though
MAR-maria27-0494	that's not what's drawn
MAR-maria27-0495	that's not what's drawn
MAR-maria27-0496	that's two tiles
MAR-maria27-0497	why would you do that
MAR-maria27-0498	why couldn't you just use a color if you wanted to create
MAR-maria27-0499	no a tile
MAR-maria27-0500	i mean that's your bullnose
MAR-maria27-0501	you could i mean
MAR-maria27-0502	i
MAR-maria27-0503	i mm
MAR-maria27-0504	what we need to do is find
MAR-maria27-0505	to to create that we need to to
MAR-maria27-0506	that that detail does it doesn't give the enough
MAR-maria27-0507	there's there's it just doesn't work
MAR-maria27-0508	eh it's gonna look
MAR-maria27-0509	right
MAR-maria27-0510	you have to many things
MAR-maria27-0511	why couldn't you use
MAR-maria27-0512	make that out of a different size tile
MAR-maria27-0513	if you wanna if you wanna the reveal
MAR-maria27-0514	you want it at top
MAR-maria27-0515	i mean the tiles are four by four right
MAR-maria27-0516	could you make it out of
MAR-maria27-0517	do they come
MAR-maria27-0518	do you see what i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0519	just a different colour tile
MAR-maria27-0520	i mean if that's what they wanna create
MAR-maria27-0521	yes sir
MAR-maria27-0522	i started to
MAR-maria27-0523	and then i got sidetracked
MAR-maria27-0524	let me finish with it
MAR-maria27-0525	o k
MAR-maria27-0526	i eh actually
MAR-maria27-0527	my first question was
MAR-maria27-0528	and i thought i printed it
MAR-maria27-0529	because i
MAR-maria27-0530	initial tasks
MAR-maria27-0531	but you don't tell me what the initial tasks are
MAR-maria27-0532	that was a first
MAR-maria27-0533	o k
MAR-maria27-0534	i printed it
MAR-maria27-0535	i printed it
MAR-maria27-0536	and it hid from me
MAR-maria27-0537	somebody run off with it
MAR-maria27-0538	right
MAR-maria27-0539	right
MAR-maria27-0540	o k
MAR-maria27-0541	i printed it
MAR-maria27-0542	and i don't
MAR-maria27-0543	i don't know where the print went
MAR-maria27-0544	i don't know where the print went
MAR-maria27-0545	printed again
MAR-maria27-0546	because the first thing that charles tell me is
MAR-maria27-0547	you listed the
MAR-maria27-0548	initial
MAR-maria27-0549	but i don't know what they are
MAR-maria27-0551	a tile
MAR-maria27-0552	i mean a tile
MAR-maria27-0553	a one or two inch tile
MAR-maria27-0554	a one by one's a tiny
MAR-maria27-0555	well we can do that
MAR-maria27-0556	but what i'm telling you is that detail
MAR-maria27-0557	but detail doesn't work
OSE-maria27-0558	you need to
MAR-maria27-0559	before you
MAR-maria27-0560	well you need to find the accesory that allows you to do that
MAR-maria27-0561	but you are making this a reveal or a tile
MAR-maria27-0562	o k
MAR-maria27-0563	so this this is a different detail than this detail
MAR-maria27-0564	to different surfaces
MAR-maria27-0565	this this is
MAR-maria27-0566	this is dry wall
MAR-maria27-0567	this is tile
MAR-maria27-0568	this is back a house
MAR-maria27-0569	this is back a house
MAR-maria27-0570	i i think
MAR-maria27-0571	we what i what i'd asked you to
MAR-maria27-0572	if you wanna do it that's fine
MAR-maria27-0573	we can always value engineering
MAR-maria27-0574	but we need to create a detail that is buildable
MAR-maria27-0575	because if you give them that they ain't gonna praise it
MAR-maria27-0576	correct
MAR-maria27-0577	right
MAR-maria27-0578	and and what's this tile was this gibson reveal
MAR-maria27-0579	see i would have i would have
MAR-maria27-0580	no
MAR-maria27-0581	if you're gonna do that then actually make it a real reveal not a tile reveal
MAR-maria27-0582	i wouldn't tile that
MAR-maria27-0583	but what if what if it
MAR-maria27-0584	it's
MAR-maria27-0585	tile tile
MAR-maria27-0586	and this is not a tile reveal
MAR-maria27-0587	there's to reveal reveal
MAR-maria27-0588	a dry wall reveal
MAR-maria27-0589	yeah
MAR-maria27-0590	but if you don't tell them how to make that reveal
MAR-maria27-0591	you ain't getting the reveal because we didn't get them any u b because we just drew a line
MAR-maria27-0592	then you need to get the accesories
MAR-maria27-0593	it's two inch
MAR-maria27-0594	you can paint it
MAR-maria27-0595	wispers
MAR-maria27-0596	wispers
MAR-maria27-0597	oh but then you are doing six
MAR-maria27-0598	so these tiles are six inches
MAR-maria27-0599	this is different than the old elementary schools
MAR-maria27-0600	mhm
MAR-maria27-0601	i i don't have an objection to the reveal
MAR-maria27-0602	but we need to make sure that we tell them how to build it
MAR-maria27-0603	because that those details that we love to draw are not buildable
MAR-maria27-0604	appears so
MAR-maria27-0605	right right
MAR-maria27-0606	i have a couple of questions
MAR-maria27-0607	o k
MAR-maria27-0608	all right
MAR-maria27-0609	but which are
MAR-maria27-0610	just so you know according to the literal points that they sent us a little portion of the second floor is concrete
MAR-maria27-0611	o k
MAR-maria27-0612	ah when you start listing what's its condition
MAR-maria27-0613	i don't know what it is
MAR-maria27-0614	the building
MAR-maria27-0615	structure
MAR-maria27-0616	xxxx i feel like one of my students
MAR-maria27-0617	i go
MAR-maria27-0618	it's too far away for me to know what you are refering to
MAR-maria27-0619	oh you still condition
MAR-maria27-0620	yeah it's part of
MAR-maria27-0621	right it's part of that pair right
MAR-maria27-0622	you just have to go back
MAR-maria27-0623	right it's right there right
MAR-maria27-0624	yeah because you are talking about that
MAR-maria27-0625	i would
MAR-maria27-0626	right
MAR-maria27-0627	o k
MAR-maria27-0628	ahm
MAR-maria27-0629	you have five thousand here
MAR-maria27-0630	then you have ten thousand back here
MAR-maria27-0631	o k
MAR-maria27-0632	ah five thousand right
MAR-maria27-0633	the seminar we're to
MAR-maria27-0634	there's a
MAR-maria27-0635	there's a testing company that is using for the part session call
MAR-maria27-0636	conservation solutions i think i gave susana the name
MAR-maria27-0637	so i wrote it down
MAR-maria27-0638	because you know
MAR-maria27-0639	it's good to know
MAR-maria27-0640	ahm
MAR-maria27-0641	the budget we're making
MAR-maria27-0642	it's in
MAR-maria27-0643	do you see what i'm asking
MAR-maria27-0644	what are we bugeting
MAR-maria27-0645	what it would take to rehabilitate it
MAR-maria27-0646	right
MAR-maria27-0647	but but the i guess that the definition is what what the estimate is for
MAR-maria27-0648	to make it a building that can be converted into something
MAR-maria27-0649	but it doesn't really include the lay out of what that something is
MAR-maria27-0650	you see what i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0651	right now it's not usable
MAR-maria27-0652	so you are gonna have to expend x amount of money to make it of viable space to be office community center whatever it is
MAR-maria27-0653	can we call it rehabilitation
MAR-maria27-0654	i mean
MAR-maria27-0655	because that's what you
MAR-maria27-0656	not rehabilitation
MAR-maria27-0657	but what
MAR-maria27-0658	you know where i'm looking for
MAR-maria27-0659	that says
MAR-maria27-0661	i mean you you you're trying to make it
MAR-maria27-0662	a building that can be functioning
MAR-maria27-0663	you are not talking about air conditioning or any of those kind of things
MAR-maria27-0664	right right right
MAR-maria27-0665	right because that's a right
MAR-maria27-0666	then then it's a rehabilitation
MAR-maria27-0667	it it
MAR-maria27-0668	deliberately open box
MAR-maria27-0669	right
MAR-maria27-0670	right right right
MAR-maria27-0671	not right right
MAR-maria27-0672	but the bulk of the budget is to make that building livable
MAR-maria27-0673	so use
MAR-maria27-0674	and then you didn't mention anything about the debris
MAR-maria27-0675	right
MAR-maria27-0676	well then you need to put it in here
MAR-maria27-0677	you know
MAR-maria27-0678	the cost is not included eh
MAR-maria27-0679	you know
MAR-maria27-0680	the contractor will be responsible
MAR-maria27-0681	we believe in removing current
MAR-maria27-0682	you see what i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0683	right
MAR-maria27-0684	but you're right here
MAR-maria27-0685	they are not only removing finishes
MAR-maria27-0686	they are removing
MAR-maria27-0687	joke
MAR-maria27-0688	may include
MAR-maria27-0689	oh ice
MAR-maria27-0690	and still we didn't spell it correctly
MAR-maria27-0691	right
MAR-maria27-0692	remove
MAR-maria27-0693	removal of all
MAR-maria27-0695	ah shoring
MAR-maria27-0696	shoring to allow us to
MAR-maria27-0697	ah and you know
MAR-maria27-0698	when they remove the roof they are gonna have to protect it from from from the building from becoming worse
MAR-maria27-0699	you know what i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0700	i mean that
MAR-maria27-0701	to protect the building from further
MAR-maria27-0702	um what's the word i'm looking for
MAR-maria27-0703	we call it demolition by neglect but it's um
MAR-maria27-0704	further ah
MAR-maria27-0705	i mean you're protecting the building
MAR-maria27-0706	i mean it's really to protect the building
MAR-maria27-0707	o k the other thing i had was
MAR-maria27-0708	we don't say anything about the outside
MAR-maria27-0709	there's not a whole load of it
MAR-maria27-0710	do we need to analyze it
MAR-maria27-0711	do we need to mention it
MAR-maria27-0712	do we need to
MAR-maria27-0713	in in ours will it say something about that outside
MAR-maria27-0714	then we maybe need to
MAR-maria27-0715	then my new
MAR-maria27-0716	space that they have there where we part
MAR-maria27-0717	are they cleaning
MAR-maria27-0718	and that's it
MAR-maria27-0719	leave it alone
MAR-maria27-0720	well then that's what we put
MAR-maria27-0721	there are no there is no side analysis or
MAR-maria27-0722	you see i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0723	you know
MAR-maria27-0724	how may cars are gonna park here
MAR-maria27-0725	i don't know
MAR-maria27-0726	that's it
MAR-maria27-0727	no side there's no side analysis
MAR-maria27-0728	you know how this people are
MAR-maria27-0729	what should my front door be
MAR-maria27-0730	i don't know
MAR-maria27-0731	he said
MAR-maria27-0732	on this street or this street
MAR-maria27-0733	so you know
MAR-maria27-0734	they may ask so that would be a following face
MAR-maria27-0735	you know
MAR-maria27-0736	what to use with the buildind
MAR-maria27-0737	you see what i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0738	is that part of our services
MAR-maria27-0739	a a very preliminary
MAR-maria27-0740	concept of how do you could use this building
MAR-maria27-0741	because if the estimate includes
MAR-maria27-0742	you know
MAR-maria27-0743	fifty thousand dollars for air conditioning
MAR-maria27-0744	or how do you know your air conditioning
MAR-maria27-0745	your air conditioning one big space
MAR-maria27-0746	or you air conditioning
MAR-maria27-0747	fifty spaces
MAR-maria27-0748	right
MAR-maria27-0749	below
MAR-maria27-0750	you are right
MAR-maria27-0751	i mean i'm sure they are gonna ask us to do that
MAR-maria27-0752	but right now they are only asking us to
MAR-maria27-0756	no
MAR-maria27-0757	are you sure you raised it all
MAR-maria27-0758	i guess he's come back to go and say
MAR-maria27-0759	well that's part of your fee
MAR-maria27-0760	well but they they are gonna ask us to do that
MAR-maria27-0761	but that's not part of this
MAR-maria27-0762	particular moment
MAR-maria27-0763	and then the prices i'm assuming
MAR-maria27-0764	five visits that's just what they gave you right
MAR-maria27-0765	five
MAR-maria27-0766	that's why you put five maximun
MAR-maria27-0767	or five visits
MAR-maria27-0768	right
MAR-maria27-0769	mhm mhm
MAR-maria27-0770	but you are not including this one
MAR-maria27-0771	then question
MAR-maria27-0772	and see peter mark up first structure
MAR-maria27-0773	but doesn't that mean that everybody gets some mark up
MAR-maria27-0774	but do we normally do that
MAR-maria27-0775	o k that that's what i'm asking
MAR-maria27-0776	that's what i'm saying
MAR-maria27-0777	you don't
MAR-maria27-0778	right o k
MAR-maria27-0779	how many hours do you think
MAR-maria27-0780	so
MAR-maria27-0781	right right right
MAR-maria27-0782	right
MAR-maria27-0783	mhm not necesarily
MAR-maria27-0784	right
MAR-maria27-0785	we'll let you have that
MAR-maria27-0786	oh you should
MAR-maria27-0787	conceptual
MAR-maria27-0788	right
MAR-maria27-0789	ups
MAR-maria27-0790	right right right
MAR-maria27-0791	or it's simply part od the report now
MAR-maria27-0792	fifty seven hours is plenty of time for the report
MAR-maria27-0794	although you do describe them almost
MAR-maria27-0795	separately
MAR-maria27-0796	so you could argue
MAR-maria27-0798	mhm
MAR-maria27-0799	it's really the report
MAR-maria27-0800	right
MAR-maria27-0801	you can take it from the report
MAR-maria27-0802	right
MAR-maria27-0803	it's still the same fifty seven hours
MAR-maria27-0804	only you split them up between thirty seven and twenty
MAR-maria27-0805	right right
MAR-maria27-0806	and see what they say
MAR-maria27-0807	you know
MAR-maria27-0808	going and developing those drawings
MAR-maria27-0809	you know
MAR-maria27-0810	it's like
MAR-maria27-0811	that's true
MAR-maria27-0812	but don't you need some drawings to tell them how to make it
MAR-maria27-0813	stand up
MAR-maria27-0814	i'm gonna think about it
MAR-maria27-0815	i've gotta put a roof fine
MAR-maria27-0816	i i' got a roof sketched this big
MAR-maria27-0817	hand run fifty sixty eighty years ago
MAR-maria27-0818	o k mister roofer
MAR-maria27-0819	use this
MAR-maria27-0820	back then that's all we needed for today
MAR-maria27-0821	i don't think so
MAR-maria27-0822	okey dokey
MAR-maria27-0823	are we trying to leave a little early so we miss the crowd
MAR-maria27-0824	i need
MAR-maria27-0825	i thought about it this morning
MAR-maria27-0826	i said
MAR-maria27-0827	i need money
MAR-maria27-0828	i was like ah
MAR-maria27-0829	i don't know
MAR-maria27-0830	it's about a hundred square feet

ANT-zeledon11-0006	all right
ANT-zeledon11-0007	now the next one
ANT-zeledon11-0008	um the next one after that
SEA-zeledon11-0009	next one

ANT-zeledon11-0014	during the incident o k uh when we were found were you standing at point one on the third floor
ANT-zeledon11-0015	that's where we were standing
ANT-zeledon11-0016	it's imperative that we make that clear because the next page
SEA-zeledon11-0017	so this so this is so this is g c right
ANT-zeledon11-0018	on the next page you'll see it
ANT-zeledon11-0019	on the next page you'll see it
ANT-zeledon11-0020	um it's imperative you say it because on the next page then he's got an option
ANT-zeledon11-0021	where were you standing you know right before you came up
ANT-zeledon11-0022	and i've got pictures for each and every one of those
SEA-zeledon11-0023	nice

ANT-zeledon11-0033	i mean
SEA-zeledon11-0034	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0035	then i think the last page i've got is the on the fifth floor
SEA-zeledon11-0036	we shoulda we we should ask ah we should ask this guy a question in spanish
ANT-zeledon11-0041	we should ask them before and after
SEA-zeledon11-0043	yeah yeah we should switch
SEA-zeledon11-0044	we should we should say all the main questions in english all the nice questions in spanish
SEA-zeledon11-0047	how do you how do you say how do you how would you say like officer in spanish
ANT-zeledon11-0052	i mean that sounds
ANT-zeledon11-0055	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0056	because i mean like if it's a detective you just say like you know detective
ANT-zeledon11-0060	make it sound better
ANT-zeledon11-0062	because if you it sounds very uh
ANT-zeledon11-0064	you know like that's
ANT-zeledon11-0066	that's or in fascist chile
SEA-zeledon11-0071	yeah actually like uh
ANT-zeledon11-0073	like that's
SEA-zeledon11-0074	did you know where the term fascism comes from
ANT-zeledon11-0075	no
SEA-zeledon11-0076	like i was watching ah rome with my dad
SEA-zeledon11-0078	that that mini series that was like well it was like it was like a like a show like a full length h b o show
SEA-zeledon11-0079	and um there was a there was a staff like a huge staff
ANT-zeledon11-0080	right
SEA-zeledon11-0081	with ah the eagle
ANT-zeledon11-0082	ok
SEA-zeledon11-0083	which is like the it's like
SEA-zeledon11-0084	i forgot the the name for the the actual emblem
SEA-zeledon11-0085	but it's ah it's it's it's some some particular thing uh that signifies the legion
SEA-zeledon11-0086	you know that signifies the caesar
SEA-zeledon11-0087	and it's called the
ANT-zeledon11-0088	the oh o k
SEA-zeledon11-0089	so so like that that staff is a symbol of state so fascism
ANT-zeledon11-0090	the statism yeah that's
SEA-zeledon11-0091	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0092	caesar that's awesome
SEA-zeledon11-0093	so yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0094	yeah so like he told me about that
SEA-zeledon11-0095	i was like
SEA-zeledon11-0096	yeah it's pretty cool
SEA-zeledon11-0097	like i didn't i didn't know that
SEA-zeledon11-0098	um
SEA-zeledon11-0099	yeah so
ANT-zeledon11-0100	now i just have to start calling you fascist instead of a communist which is ridiculous and stuff
ANT-zeledon11-0101	it's like
ANT-zeledon11-0102	boggle my mind laughs
SEA-zeledon11-0103	there's no difference
SEA-zeledon11-0104	that's the thing
SEA-zeledon11-0105	like like like like if
ANT-zeledon11-0106	yes there is
SEA-zeledon11-0107	as my as my friend always brings up it's like if you take like the the two polar extremes are curved you know
SEA-zeledon11-0109	so at the at the high point of the curve they are at opposite ends
SEA-zeledon11-0110	but as you get lower on the curve or higher on the curve they start to converge
ANT-zeledon11-0111	that's an interesting way to look at it
SEA-zeledon11-0112	because think about it you know
SEA-zeledon11-0113	fascist italy and communist soviet union not that different you know
ANT-zeledon11-0114	but they fought
SEA-zeledon11-0115	so i mean
SEA-zeledon11-0117	you know what i mean
SEA-zeledon11-0118	so it's what's the difference
SEA-zeledon11-0119	you know it's it's a it's a state governed
ANT-zeledon11-0120	so it's the name of the brand man so
SEA-zeledon11-0121	yeah it's like it's like government
SEA-zeledon11-0122	yeah well it's not state it's government you know
SEA-zeledon11-0123	it's it's management
SEA-zeledon11-0124	i mean yeah it's whatever you know
SEA-zeledon11-0125	so
ANT-zeledon11-0126	i shot an a k yesterday
SEA-zeledon11-0127	i was gonna ask you that
SEA-zeledon11-0128	i was gonna ask you about the about the gun

ANT-zeledon11-0140	i shot that
SEA-zeledon11-0141	a man rifle yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0142	destroyed my right destroyed my shoulder
SEA-zeledon11-0143	nice whispers
ANT-zeledon11-0144	um it literally felt like the second i pulled the trigger there was this small like gnome right at the hundred yard mark who ran over and then punched me in the shoulder and ran back behind the target
SEA-zeledon11-0145	nice nice
ANT-zeledon11-0146	um
ANT-zeledon11-0147	red like from here to here
SEA-zeledon11-0148	nice whispers

SEA-zeledon11-0152	nice
ANT-zeledon11-0153	laughs
ANT-zeledon11-0154	um
SEA-zeledon11-0155	what's that called the like the the
ANT-zeledon11-0156	recoil
SEA-zeledon11-0157	recoil
SEA-zeledon11-0158	i was gonna say backlash
ANT-zeledon11-0159	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0160	but it's essentially the same
ANT-zeledon11-0161	it's pretty much the same thing
ANT-zeledon11-0162	but when you're talking about guns it's recoil
SEA-zeledon11-0163	right
ANT-zeledon11-0164	after that i shot the a k like maybe a hundred times
ANT-zeledon11-0165	and that that was nothing
ANT-zeledon11-0166	that was nothing compared to that first rifle that was nothing
ANT-zeledon11-0167	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0168	you have to see you have to see lord of war because lord of war like the centre piece weapon in lord of war is the a k the kalashnikov you know
ANT-zeledon11-0169	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0170	like he starts he goes into this monologue about like all the benefits of of a kalashnikov
SEA-zeledon11-0171	and it's it's like it's the weapon
SEA-zeledon11-0172	and it's like the
ANT-zeledon11-0173	you know how they market
ANT-zeledon11-0174	i mean i'm sure you know this
ANT-zeledon11-0175	but do you know how they marketed the kalashnikov
SEA-zeledon11-0176	no
ANT-zeledon11-0177	the first time around
ANT-zeledon11-0178	um the first time they marketed it they said i can clear a soccer field with four hundred men like that are that four hundred men with ten of mine
ANT-zeledon11-0179	give me ten kalashnikovs and ten men and i will clear a football field with four hundred people
SEA-zeledon11-0180	jesus
ANT-zeledon11-0181	how long
ANT-zeledon11-0182	they asked
ANT-zeledon11-0183	four seconds
SEA-zeledon11-0184	four seconds
SEA-zeledon11-0185	what do the other guys have
ANT-zeledon11-0186	well nothing
SEA-zeledon11-0187	they have rocks
ANT-zeledon11-0188	you have four seconds to throw a rock
ANT-zeledon11-0189	you know you never
ANT-zeledon11-0191	you know i realized yesterday why people don't use full auto um when they shoot
ANT-zeledon11-0192	and it's because i heard someone shoot an a k full auto thirty rounds
ANT-zeledon11-0193	it took about four seconds
ANT-zeledon11-0194	the entire magazine gone
ANT-zeledon11-0195	it was like one two three four done
ANT-zeledon11-0196	it was a whole magazine
ANT-zeledon11-0197	they've now wasted thirty rounds of ammunition
ANT-zeledon11-0198	it probably cost them twenty dollars in four seconds in four or five seconds
SEA-zeledon11-0199	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0200	i mean if you have your target in place i mean you want to unleash
SEA-zeledon11-0201	do it
SEA-zeledon11-0202	go full auto you know but
ANT-zeledon11-0203	that's why they use three round burst
ANT-zeledon11-0204	um that's that's why they use three round
ANT-zeledon11-0205	and the three round burst is pretty fast
ANT-zeledon11-0206	it's
ANT-zeledon11-0207	but at least with three round you hit in the same place
SEA-zeledon11-0208	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0209	i was shooting it shot by shot with the kalashnikov at um twenty five yards
ANT-zeledon11-0210	this was the spray you know
ANT-zeledon11-0211	this was the area i was hitting
ANT-zeledon11-0212	it's not an accurate gun at all
ANT-zeledon11-0213	the other rifle on the other hand is
ANT-zeledon11-0214	the only problem is after you shoot it once you don't want to shoot it again
ANT-zeledon11-0215	so the the first time you shoot you hit dead on the mark
ANT-zeledon11-0216	but the next time you shoot you kind of like anticipate
ANT-zeledon11-0217	and you start getting nervous like right right
ANT-zeledon11-0218	this is what's so funny
ANT-zeledon11-0219	i'm holding it
ANT-zeledon11-0220	and i can see my breath moving the end of the gun little by little
SEA-zeledon11-0221	hmm
ANT-zeledon11-0222	and then i put my finger on the trigger
ANT-zeledon11-0223	and i know it's gonna hurt me
ANT-zeledon11-0224	and then you see my rifle start doing this
ANT-zeledon11-0225	pretty funny
ANT-zeledon11-0226	it's an experience man
ANT-zeledon11-0227	you should come
SEA-zeledon11-0228	did you did you fire anything smaller than a rifle or
ANT-zeledon11-0229	um no i i fired a really crappy um rifle
ANT-zeledon11-0230	david'seng rifle
ANT-zeledon11-0231	it's a twenty two
ANT-zeledon11-0232	it sounds like
ANT-zeledon11-0233	it's
SEA-zeledon11-0234	so so it fits david'seng personality
SEA-zeledon11-0235	you know just kind of like
ANT-zeledon11-0236	oh yeah actually yeah it kind of does
ANT-zeledon11-0238	um
SEA-zeledon11-0239	yeah i i i asked carlos
SEA-zeledon11-0240	and he said he says he's down to to um to oversee today's proceedings with todd and stuff
ANT-zeledon11-0241	interesting ok
ANT-zeledon11-0242	um
SEA-zeledon11-0243	i think i think he's gonna offer a good good perspectives like good notes
SEA-zeledon11-0244	like i didn't talk to him too much yesterday about it
SEA-zeledon11-0245	i just brought it up but so
ANT-zeledon11-0246	you know i figure for the first hour we can um we can just get the questions out of the way
ANT-zeledon11-0247	it it might take an hour
ANT-zeledon11-0248	just get all write down all the questions all of them everything we can come up with
ANT-zeledon11-0249	and then we have two hours to kind of practice
SEA-zeledon11-0250	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0251	yeah we can role play
SEA-zeledon11-0252	we can you know
ANT-zeledon11-0253	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0254	he can he can be he can be a character you know and just
ANT-zeledon11-0255	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0256	he can be the officer
SEA-zeledon11-0257	you can be the officer
SEA-zeledon11-0258	so
ANT-zeledon11-0259	and he takes three different shots at him
ANT-zeledon11-0260	i mean he can he can lie the first time or
ANT-zeledon11-0261	tell the truth the second time
ANT-zeledon11-0262	are you gonna turn off your thing
SEA-zeledon11-0263	my what
ANT-zeledon11-0264	your little cube
SEA-zeledon11-0265	no no i'm charging it
ANT-zeledon11-0266	oh ok
SEA-zeledon11-0267	like a yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0268	i got nervous today man
SEA-zeledon11-0269	i went i went upstairs
SEA-zeledon11-0270	i need to get there early on wednesday
SEA-zeledon11-0271	because i was like
SEA-zeledon11-0272	like i got a like i got a little nervous you know
SEA-zeledon11-0273	so
SEA-zeledon11-0274	i mean i think it's just jitters that are gonna go away within like five minutes
SEA-zeledon11-0275	i just need to like breath in the musk of that room you know
ANT-zeledon11-0276	you're uh
ANT-zeledon11-0277	you're talking about the uh the jitters you get when you go up there
SEA-zeledon11-0278	yeah like just the
ANT-zeledon11-0279	it happens to me every single time
SEA-zeledon11-0280	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0281	i saw the woman
SEA-zeledon11-0282	i saw i saw the director
ANT-zeledon11-0283	you saw the dark sith lord
SEA-zeledon11-0284	she looked she looked she looked ok
ANT-zeledon11-0285	she's
SEA-zeledon11-0286	she looked like somebody that's not gonna
SEA-zeledon11-0287	i i didn't see like i didn't see the dark force
SEA-zeledon11-0288	it's like i don't want anything from her i just
ANT-zeledon11-0289	i i didn't see it either until we sat down
ANT-zeledon11-0290	she just goes
ANT-zeledon11-0291	what's her name samantha
ANT-zeledon11-0292	she she goes up to samantha
ANT-zeledon11-0293	and she's like
ANT-zeledon11-0294	no he's i'll take him
ANT-zeledon11-0295	like what
ANT-zeledon11-0296	and then when we sat down she she started telling me some stuff
ANT-zeledon11-0297	she seemed ok
ANT-zeledon11-0298	and then i started asking questions asking questions
ANT-zeledon11-0299	and she
ANT-zeledon11-0300	and then give me an answer
ANT-zeledon11-0301	and then
ANT-zeledon11-0302	can i keep going
ANT-zeledon11-0303	and then i'd ask another question
ANT-zeledon11-0304	she'd give me an answer
ANT-zeledon11-0305	it's really weird
SEA-zeledon11-0306	she'd give you an answer
ANT-zeledon11-0307	she's
SEA-zeledon11-0308	in that in that face
SEA-zeledon11-0309	or wouldn't give you an answer
ANT-zeledon11-0310	yeah like in that face well she would give me an answer sometimes
ANT-zeledon11-0311	she would also use that face to dodge me
ANT-zeledon11-0312	so she kind of like her face gets stone cold when she's trying to dodge people
SEA-zeledon11-0314	i i i think i think i i think we need to kill her with kindness you know just
ANT-zeledon11-0315	oh yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0316	it's like hello you know how's it going
SEA-zeledon11-0317	i mean like you know very
SEA-zeledon11-0318	you know i haven't i have no problem being kind to the police
SEA-zeledon11-0319	i mean kind to whoever
SEA-zeledon11-0320	because this is all about survival so
SEA-zeledon11-0321	survival i will l will like i will shake hands
SEA-zeledon11-0322	i will like do whatever it takes
SEA-zeledon11-0323	because when it's all said and done you know i can hate whoever i wanna hate at twelve o'clock at one o'clock
ANT-zeledon11-0324	at twelve o'clock laughs
SEA-zeledon11-0325	i'm twenty four years i'm twenty five
SEA-zeledon11-0326	i'm twenty five years old
SEA-zeledon11-0327	like i can hate whoever i want for the rest of my life
SEA-zeledon11-0328	like these three hours are are big
SEA-zeledon11-0329	so
SEA-zeledon11-0330	i mean i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be anything above and beyond courteous above and beyond respectful
SEA-zeledon11-0331	i mean i that that's that's my main thing
SEA-zeledon11-0332	i wanna be respectful
SEA-zeledon11-0333	because because again like whether whether the the officers
SEA-zeledon11-0334	i mean i'm i'm i think she deserves respect just as an individual
SEA-zeledon11-0335	but whether the officers deserve respect or not is not a matter of intrinsically
SEA-zeledon11-0336	it's a matter of in the proceedings
SEA-zeledon11-0337	the proceedings have to be treated with respect
SEA-zeledon11-0338	because given that it's so wishy washy given that it's so shifty and unstructured respect is gonna factor in
ANT-zeledon11-0339	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0340	you know if we're aggressive if we're you know assholish if we're whatever then
ANT-zeledon11-0341	yeah you gotta
SEA-zeledon11-0342	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0343	can you can you just if possible can you just like tap me or something
ANT-zeledon11-0344	don't make it too public
ANT-zeledon11-0345	but just do something when i'm getting agressive
ANT-zeledon11-0346	because i know that when i question people maybe the first fifteen minutes is good but i i i do feel like i'm hunting them down when i get the answer i want
SEA-zeledon11-0347	maybe i can crack my fingers or something
ANT-zeledon11-0348	ok
SEA-zeledon11-0349	just just watch for that
SEA-zeledon11-0350	watch me crack my fingers
SEA-zeledon11-0351	and just calm down
ANT-zeledon11-0352	ok
SEA-zeledon11-0353	um and again like like it'll probably be you ask a question
SEA-zeledon11-0354	and then i ask a question
SEA-zeledon11-0355	and todd asks a question
SEA-zeledon11-0356	i don't think you're gonna you're gonna be allowed to ask like consecutive questions
SEA-zeledon11-0357	it's gonna you me todd you me todd like that
SEA-zeledon11-0358	ok
SEA-zeledon11-0359	so which is good
SEA-zeledon11-0360	because then you know you're thinking about your next question
ANT-zeledon11-0361	we have time
SEA-zeledon11-0362	so
SEA-zeledon11-0364	i was looking at this trash can
SEA-zeledon11-0365	and then i'm thinking like uh
ANT-zeledon11-0366	it looks like r two d two doesn't it
SEA-zeledon11-0367	it looks like r two d two yes
SEA-zeledon11-0369	yes it looks like you know like a a coked out you know
ANT-zeledon11-0370	a coked out laughs drunk
SEA-zeledon11-0371	like yeah like technology has has has uh passed him by
SEA-zeledon11-0372	he's a you know he's an inebriated
SEA-zeledon11-0374	he's just like washed up machine
SEA-zeledon11-0375	and then he's just like he's vacant like his whole face is just like
ANT-zeledon11-0376	he's just laughs
SEA-zeledon11-0377	he's missing like half his operating system
SEA-zeledon11-0378	he's like he's just like
SEA-zeledon11-0379	beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
ANT-zeledon11-0380	he hasn't had an upgrade in years
ANT-zeledon11-0381	i mean just look at this guy
SEA-zeledon11-0382	yes
SEA-zeledon11-0384	but yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0385	but i think i think i had in spanish
SEA-zeledon11-0386	it's like like
SEA-zeledon11-0387	i mean how do you say
SEA-zeledon11-0390	you know it's but it's like
SEA-zeledon11-0391	like the the that compound in english
SEA-zeledon11-0392	you know it's just like you're not going to find that in spanish
SEA-zeledon11-0393	trash can
SEA-zeledon11-0395	trash and it's a can
SEA-zeledon11-0396	you know it's trash can
SEA-zeledon11-0397	like in in a in a in a in spanish it's just like no it's like it's one item
ANT-zeledon11-0401	it's just that's what it
ANT-zeledon11-0402	you know that's actually something i like about spanish
ANT-zeledon11-0403	um it really combines a lot of words
ANT-zeledon11-0404	it's not um of the
ANT-zeledon11-0406	that's right
SEA-zeledon11-0409	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0410	so much more efficient i think
SEA-zeledon11-0412	yeah but in but in but in english you have you have what they what i mean what i'm gonna call right now like like prepositional adverbials becoming becoming adjectives
SEA-zeledon11-0413	so you have uh again like a professor of french say french professor
SEA-zeledon11-0414	whereas in spanish you don't have that
ANT-zeledon11-0415	that's right you don't
SEA-zeledon11-0416	there is that there is no
ANT-zeledon11-0420	it means a french like literally from france
SEA-zeledon11-0421	yes yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0422	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0423	yeah so that it's it's disambiguated
SEA-zeledon11-0424	in english you have that ambiguous ambiguous possibility because of the the way you can put place um uh modifiers
ANT-zeledon11-0425	you know that's actually that's actually another reason why i prefer to write in english as to writing in spanish
ANT-zeledon11-0426	because english does allow you to be a little ambiguous which means you can have so many more double meanings at times
ANT-zeledon11-0427	and makes it interesting
SEA-zeledon11-0428	told me that they actually want disambiguation like so
ANT-zeledon11-0429	oh well uh i'm talking about like when i write like poetry or music
SEA-zeledon11-0430	ok right
ANT-zeledon11-0431	no when it comes to journalism i want crystal clear
SEA-zeledon11-0432	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0433	in that case spanish would be a little better but it's longer
ANT-zeledon11-0434	little things like that really lengthen an article
ANT-zeledon11-0435	you don't know how many times i'm like like the professor of france french professor
SEA-zeledon11-0436	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0437	ok
SEA-zeledon11-0438	that's it that's it
ANT-zeledon11-0439	yeah this see i don't imagine this r two d two having beeps
ANT-zeledon11-0440	i i see it having like a like a
SEA-zeledon11-0441	nice
SEA-zeledon11-0446	um man like i've i've been like nauseous all day
SEA-zeledon11-0447	like just thinking about all this crap
SEA-zeledon11-0448	like i don't have my test results yet so
SEA-zeledon11-0449	you know like
SEA-zeledon11-0450	like i i was actually telling marta that like you know the way the way i cope with any of this
SEA-zeledon11-0451	she still doesn't know about wednesday
SEA-zeledon11-0452	but the way i cope with any of this is that i i take it
ANT-zeledon11-0453	how do you not tell her
SEA-zeledon11-0454	because there's not point
ANT-zeledon11-0455	no i ok i know there's no point
ANT-zeledon11-0456	and you being a man of efficiency will obviously not tell her if there's no point
SEA-zeledon11-0457	yeah yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0458	like i told her
ANT-zeledon11-0459	you know when she finds out she's gonna wanna kill you
SEA-zeledon11-0460	i don't know if she's ever gonna find out
SEA-zeledon11-0461	you know it's
SEA-zeledon11-0462	i mean unless like i get screwed over you know
ANT-zeledon11-0463	i guess
SEA-zeledon11-0464	yeah i'll i mean i'm just gonna really down play it
SEA-zeledon11-0465	like because like my whole idea is that
ANT-zeledon11-0466	it's always no big deal
SEA-zeledon11-0467	it's always no big deal you know
SEA-zeledon11-0468	like had she been here had she been here i would have told her
SEA-zeledon11-0469	because i told her about the event
SEA-zeledon11-0470	i told her that evening i spoke to her
SEA-zeledon11-0471	i was like
SEA-zeledon11-0472	oh like this shit happened and whatever
SEA-zeledon11-0473	and she's like
SEA-zeledon11-0474	oh that really sucks you know
SEA-zeledon11-0475	but i just never brought it up again you know
SEA-zeledon11-0476	like i never told her when i got hearing notice

ANT-zeledon11-0555	you couldn't see him so
ANT-zeledon11-0556	that's anyway
ANT-zeledon11-0557	yeah we should start numbering them
ANT-zeledon11-0558	um if you don't mind helping me
ANT-zeledon11-0559	i brought a pen
SEA-zeledon11-0560	sure sure
ANT-zeledon11-0561	um i'm going to i'm going to number um
ANT-zeledon11-0562	let me figure out
SEA-zeledon11-0563	this is your first one too
SEA-zeledon11-0564	with these two people
ANT-zeledon11-0565	um see the things are not in order
ANT-zeledon11-0566	so i we can just tell from the photo where each one is
ANT-zeledon11-0567	so
SEA-zeledon11-0568	ok
ANT-zeledon11-0569	let's ah let's just try this
ANT-zeledon11-0570	put the map upside down
ANT-zeledon11-0572	if you don't mind actually this might be easier for you or for me
ANT-zeledon11-0573	i'm just gonna
ANT-zeledon11-0574	i'm just gonna put these close to each other kind of like if i'm putting a map on paper
ANT-zeledon11-0575	um this one's closer
SEA-zeledon11-0576	yeah let's just number one set
SEA-zeledon11-0577	and then we'll just mimic the other side
ANT-zeledon11-0578	yeah yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0579	that's what we're gonna do
SEA-zeledon11-0580	but anyways that picture that you took um like ah that brings me up to like that one day that i went to go to
ANT-zeledon11-0582	vacilarte
SEA-zeledon11-0583	have you have you ever heard that
ANT-zeledon11-0589	no
SEA-zeledon11-0590	oh man like that is like such an awesome word
SEA-zeledon11-0592	o k
SEA-zeledon11-0593	it also means to have fun
SEA-zeledon11-0594	so it could just mean like it's like it's like being merry you know or having fun having a good time like living it up
SEA-zeledon11-0595	you know
ANT-zeledon11-0596	that's funny i always confused being merry with being married
ANT-zeledon11-0597	sorry what did you say
SEA-zeledon11-0598	no no no being merry
ANT-zeledon11-0599	what
ANT-zeledon11-0600	so unlike you
SEA-zeledon11-0603	it's not just visually
SEA-zeledon11-0604	it's not it's because you see you can't directly translate it into checking it out to checking out like i checked out that girl
SEA-zeledon11-0605	you can't say like i checked her
SEA-zeledon11-0606	it's not quite the same
SEA-zeledon11-0607	it's i am i there there's an aspectual there's an aspectual component
SEA-zeledon11-0608	aspectual means like there's a there's a it's a it's more complex
SEA-zeledon11-0609	so it's not just i went to the store it's like i have gone to the store
SEA-zeledon11-0610	so you have the complexity of of perfective tense
SEA-zeledon11-0612	and i am in the process of checking her out
SEA-zeledon11-0613	so i am taking her in
SEA-zeledon11-0614	it's like i am drinking i am drinking her sight visually
SEA-zeledon11-0615	i am drinking the sight of her
ANT-zeledon11-0616	wow
ANT-zeledon11-0619	how would you use that
SEA-zeledon11-0624	i mean that's really direct you know
ANT-zeledon11-0625	that's ah
SEA-zeledon11-0626	you know it's like
ANT-zeledon11-0627	that's laughs
SEA-zeledon11-0629	it's like
SEA-zeledon11-0630	but it's just like i i took her in
SEA-zeledon11-0631	i didn't just check her out
SEA-zeledon11-0632	it's a it's a it's a it's a renewing process of checking out
SEA-zeledon11-0633	it's like checking out for an extended period of time
SEA-zeledon11-0634	taking it all in
ANT-zeledon11-0635	you know i can't imagine that that has the same effect in english
ANT-zeledon11-0636	i mean
SEA-zeledon11-0637	no no it doesn't
ANT-zeledon11-0639	that's one thing
SEA-zeledon11-0640	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0641	i'm inspecting you
SEA-zeledon11-0642	yeah there's no there's no
ANT-zeledon11-0643	that wow
ANT-zeledon11-0644	so there isn't that um that authoritative
SEA-zeledon11-0645	no no no it's very it's very like it's very fluid you know
SEA-zeledon11-0647	very like just take it in you know
SEA-zeledon11-0648	it's it's like a full it's like it's like a it's like opening up the lense you know like to you know the slow slowest shutter speed
SEA-zeledon11-0649	just letting letting the entire image you know like
SEA-zeledon11-0651	materialize you know just
SEA-zeledon11-0652	it's
SEA-zeledon11-0655	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0656	it's it's a it's a it's a serious word
ANT-zeledon11-0657	that's new in my vocabulary
ANT-zeledon11-0658	that sticks
SEA-zeledon11-0659	i mean like like i'm obsessed with it
SEA-zeledon11-0660	i'm just like like there's no equivalent
SEA-zeledon11-0662	i mean you have to say i'm scanning you
SEA-zeledon11-0663	checking you out i'm taking you in
SEA-zeledon11-0664	taking the sight of you in
SEA-zeledon11-0665	you know i am comparing you to like the you know the schema that i have in my head
SEA-zeledon11-0666	all these things are contained within that one word
ANT-zeledon11-0668	what brought this up at
SEA-zeledon11-0669	no no no like i'm i'm i'm driving on down the street
SEA-zeledon11-0670	and i see this woman you know
SEA-zeledon11-0671	it's like then i just like turned
SEA-zeledon11-0672	it's like it's like this word just a word you know it's for this you know for like the type of
SEA-zeledon11-0673	because like we checked her out on the way there and on the way back like
SEA-zeledon11-0674	because we had to use the u turn
SEA-zeledon11-0676	i mean i got i got the full view just the full view
SEA-zeledon11-0677	it's like
SEA-zeledon11-0678	it's like i'm i've taken this woman in
ANT-zeledon11-0679	my god
SEA-zeledon11-0680	like like i understand
SEA-zeledon11-0681	you know like various aspects of her of her of her personality you know like you know visually visually
SEA-zeledon11-0682	purely visually
ANT-zeledon11-0683	of her visual personality
ANT-zeledon11-0684	that's that's the best euphemism i've ever heard
SEA-zeledon11-0685	visual persona i'd say visual persona
SEA-zeledon11-0686	like
SEA-zeledon11-0688	i mean there's a difference in persona and personality
SEA-zeledon11-0690	but again like and then like you can turn it you can turn it right around and make it a make it an activity
ANT-zeledon11-0693	yeah the verb
SEA-zeledon11-0694	which means like in in in a general sense you know life has to be enjoyed
SEA-zeledon11-0695	you know like take in life
SEA-zeledon11-0696	you know take in a a joyous activity you know
SEA-zeledon11-0697	so
ANT-zeledon11-0703	that's that's that's interesting
ANT-zeledon11-0704	i wonder if there's some
ANT-zeledon11-0705	i mean you would know this better than i would if there's something in history something that happened that somehow brought those two words together if it was fun to inspect
ANT-zeledon11-0706	what was when was it fun to check out
SEA-zeledon11-0707	just had natural curiosity you know
ANT-zeledon11-0708	so it's of curiosity
SEA-zeledon11-0709	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0710	americans have no curiosity
SEA-zeledon11-0711	the thing is again if i i do i do find myself victim to to or subject to to that that clinical approach to vision
ANT-zeledon11-0712	what do you mean
SEA-zeledon11-0713	you know vision like the my my visual filter is is a is a clinical mechanism
SEA-zeledon11-0714	it's a it's an inspection mechanism
SEA-zeledon11-0715	and you lose some of that pleasure
SEA-zeledon11-0716	you know like the there's there's pleasure in sight
SEA-zeledon11-0717	you know like i look i look at a mountain side and like there's no pleasure
SEA-zeledon11-0718	you know it's it's like a shape
SEA-zeledon11-0719	you know it's it's shapes
SEA-zeledon11-0720	um and and the only thing i'm trying to do is figure out how it all works together
ANT-zeledon11-0721	what
ANT-zeledon11-0722	why
SEA-zeledon11-0723	i don't i don't get
SEA-zeledon11-0724	i don't get that that hit you know
SEA-zeledon11-0725	but like remembering that word and remembering and like and like i think like that that doesn't happen to me with women at least
SEA-zeledon11-0726	you know like certain things certain things like really catch my eye you know
ANT-zeledon11-0727	you need to take a photography class with a pretentious professor
ANT-zeledon11-0729	you need to take a photography class
ANT-zeledon11-0730	it makes you see things differently
ANT-zeledon11-0731	make you see your shapes differently
ANT-zeledon11-0732	if you take the right professor um this guy ted mackenzie
ANT-zeledon11-0733	not that you would ever take his class
ANT-zeledon11-0734	but if you audit it or
SEA-zeledon11-0735	yeah valerie valerie'seng told me about him like
SEA-zeledon11-0736	she was she was friends with him
ANT-zeledon11-0737	valerie

ANT-zeledon11-0758	this is three right
ANT-zeledon11-0759	i'm looking at it upside down
ANT-zeledon11-0760	the three
ANT-zeledon11-0761	this is close enough to be three
ANT-zeledon11-0762	this would have to be four
ANT-zeledon11-0763	this would have to be this would have to be four as well
ANT-zeledon11-0764	this is kind of the general area
ANT-zeledon11-0765	um
ANT-zeledon11-0766	ok this is definitely a three
ANT-zeledon11-0767	ok
SEA-zeledon11-0768	you know how to say hairline in spanish
SEA-zeledon11-0769	i forgot

ANT-zeledon11-0783	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0784	to the slides like going further in you know so
ANT-zeledon11-0785	we've been over this
ANT-zeledon11-0786	didn't we talk about this at dunkin donuts
SEA-zeledon11-0787	what about it
ANT-zeledon11-0788	i think you asked me how to say hairline in spanish
ANT-zeledon11-0789	and i was like
ANT-zeledon11-0790	i don't know
ANT-zeledon11-0791	but i know about the entrances
ANT-zeledon11-0792	and you were like
SEA-zeledon11-0794	yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0796	no i don't remember
ANT-zeledon11-0797	i could have sworn you brought it up then
ANT-zeledon11-0798	um yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0799	i have no idea how to say hairline
ANT-zeledon11-0800	is there a spanish dictionary over here
ANT-zeledon11-0801	look it up
SEA-zeledon11-0802	we do not we do not have a spanish dictionary
SEA-zeledon11-0803	not that i know of
ANT-zeledon11-0804	american dictionary
SEA-zeledon11-0805	i'm not gonna look for it
SEA-zeledon11-0806	no
SEA-zeledon11-0807	don't worry about it
SEA-zeledon11-0808	but uh
ANT-zeledon11-0809	hairline
SEA-zeledon11-0812	i have no idea
ANT-zeledon11-0813	or bald
ANT-zeledon11-0814	there's gotta be some base term
ANT-zeledon11-0816	i don't know
ANT-zeledon11-0817	so this is three
ANT-zeledon11-0818	and we'll say this is
ANT-zeledon11-0819	this is kind of the same area as three
ANT-zeledon11-0820	this would have to be four
SEA-zeledon11-0821	so you're at three two threes
ANT-zeledon11-0822	yeah because i'm i'm doing general area
SEA-zeledon11-0823	ok
ANT-zeledon11-0824	i had to make these numbers big enough so that they could see it
SEA-zeledon11-0825	i see what you're saying
ANT-zeledon11-0826	so
SEA-zeledon11-0827	so you're grouping it area wise ok
ANT-zeledon11-0828	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0829	and then i'm gonna be like
ANT-zeledon11-0830	so where were you standing in these two
ANT-zeledon11-0831	do you remember what it looked like
ANT-zeledon11-0832	because this is what it looked like from that direction
ANT-zeledon11-0834	and i can pick
SEA-zeledon11-0835	this
ANT-zeledon11-0836	that's why i don't i don't want him to be like
ANT-zeledon11-0837	i was standing in three but a little bit more to the right
ANT-zeledon11-0838	ok well here you go
SEA-zeledon11-0839	yeah this is the benefit of here where like we present this once
SEA-zeledon11-0840	there's no need to to do it over and over again
ANT-zeledon11-0841	do this over and over and over again yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0842	what did chuck nerris say
SEA-zeledon11-0843	um he didn't say anything
SEA-zeledon11-0844	i mean i told him like you know we we should get together after it's all said and done
SEA-zeledon11-0845	i mean he wrote me the two letters and stuff
SEA-zeledon11-0846	he wrote me i mean one of them's gonna turn into the other one
SEA-zeledon11-0847	i guess i'll keep i guess i'll get to read them
SEA-zeledon11-0848	because i've never read like any letter that anyone has ever written me so
ANT-zeledon11-0849	really
SEA-zeledon11-0850	yeah these like recommendations they're always like sealed so
ANT-zeledon11-0851	by the way don't think that you're gonna get away with taking away the poetry book
ANT-zeledon11-0852	it goes right back on my piano when you're done
SEA-zeledon11-0853	no no it's it's in it's in my car
SEA-zeledon11-0854	i noticed
ANT-zeledon11-0855	i noticed it
ANT-zeledon11-0856	sat down at the piano yesterday
ANT-zeledon11-0858	and i was like
ANT-zeledon11-0859	i'm gonna play
ANT-zeledon11-0860	hey where the is my poetry book
SEA-zeledon11-0862	it hasn't been it hadn't been touched though
SEA-zeledon11-0863	i left it on the same page
ANT-zeledon11-0864	i have been reading it
SEA-zeledon11-0865	really
ANT-zeledon11-0866	yes
SEA-zeledon11-0867	since since i showed you that poem
SEA-zeledon11-0868	because i
ANT-zeledon11-0869	a while back yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0870	because it's
SEA-zeledon11-0871	i mean i showed you that poem
SEA-zeledon11-0872	and then like i left it on that page
ANT-zeledon11-0873	actually i tend to get books and leave them exactly as they are um which is probably why my book collection is like
ANT-zeledon11-0874	i don't know if you've noticed this
ANT-zeledon11-0875	it doesn't have creases
ANT-zeledon11-0877	my books don't have creases
ANT-zeledon11-0878	because if i find i'm on a certain page and i find them in a certain condition i leave it as it is so
SEA-zeledon11-0879	i i i damage my books
SEA-zeledon11-0880	i almost get like a certain joy out of it you know
SEA-zeledon11-0881	like a slight a slight damage you know like
ANT-zeledon11-0882	why laughs
ANT-zeledon11-0883	why
SEA-zeledon11-0884	it's been read
SEA-zeledon11-0885	it's been
ANT-zeledon11-0886	nah
SEA-zeledon11-0887	it's been
SEA-zeledon11-0888	i mean i mean i if i had to choose like if i could keep it in perfect form
SEA-zeledon11-0889	but i like to bend my books back
SEA-zeledon11-0890	i like to write in them
SEA-zeledon11-0891	take notes
SEA-zeledon11-0892	carry them everywhere
SEA-zeledon11-0893	and if i have big cargo pockets put them in big cargo pockets
SEA-zeledon11-0894	so
ANT-zeledon11-0895	this is gonna be in as well
ANT-zeledon11-0896	i'm pretty sure we can have uh two pictures for every area so he can't say you know
ANT-zeledon11-0897	it was a little bit north of that
ANT-zeledon11-0899	i'm not gonna fall into your trap
ANT-zeledon11-0900	you know
SEA-zeledon11-0901	you're trap
ANT-zeledon11-0902	um this is
SEA-zeledon11-0903	yeah see we're the ones setting a trap
ANT-zeledon11-0904	oh yeah we're
SEA-zeledon11-0905	we're trappists
ANT-zeledon11-0906	we're absolutely trappists my friend
SEA-zeledon11-0907	fur trappers yeah
SEA-zeledon11-0908	yeah we're trapping police
ANT-zeledon11-0909	yeah
ANT-zeledon11-0912	a nice way to get rid of him
SEA-zeledon11-0913	yeah don't ask your questions too quickly
SEA-zeledon11-0914	like like rapid fire like four questions you know
SEA-zeledon11-0915	and that's just like that's it's just gonna make him an enemy
SEA-zeledon11-0916	you know and it's gonna make the the
SEA-zeledon11-0917	you know we want
ANT-zeledon11-0918	isn't it disgusting that if we make one the enemy the other one goes to like really
SEA-zeledon11-0919	worse
ANT-zeledon11-0920	work like this
SEA-zeledon11-0921	i i want them to be i wanna be as respectful as possible
SEA-zeledon11-0922	because i want to give them no reason
SEA-zeledon11-0923	they can like
SEA-zeledon11-0924	if if we remain calm and then they become agitated like especially the police officer like officer police like
SEA-zeledon11-0925	you know or you know or or
SEA-zeledon11-0926	just trying to ask a question like
SEA-zeledon11-0927	you know i i i don't i don't desire anyone to become agitated
SEA-zeledon11-0928	you know so
SEA-zeledon11-0929	so if we can make him lose his cool that's great you know
SEA-zeledon11-0930	we don't lose our cool
ANT-zeledon11-0931	no we can't
ANT-zeledon11-0932	we can't
ANT-zeledon11-0933	this is seven
ANT-zeledon11-0934	um this is going to be seven as well
SEA-zeledon11-0936	we need to be very careful about dan interrupting
SEA-zeledon11-0938	i i mean i've never seen dan in this type of scenario so i don't know
ANT-zeledon11-0939	i don't know either
SEA-zeledon11-0940	but i know in in purely conversational settings dan has no concept of of interruption
ANT-zeledon11-0941	i don't know what to tell you
ANT-zeledon11-0942	nope
SEA-zeledon11-0943	he will just jump in
SEA-zeledon11-0944	jump right in
SEA-zeledon11-0945	have something to say have something to say
ANT-zeledon11-0946	dan will have nothing to say from nine o'clock to twelve o'clock unless we ask him so
SEA-zeledon11-0947	yeah we should definitely include him though
SEA-zeledon11-0948	because like we
ANT-zeledon11-0949	oh well he's part of it of course
SEA-zeledon11-0950	because if we don't include him then then she's gonna start like taking it upon herself to include him
ANT-zeledon11-0951	yeah
