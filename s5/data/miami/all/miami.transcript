ya me acordé.
porque ella me dijo.

así me dijo.
pues sabe que.
ella me dijo.
I'm not coming tomorrow.
que no iba a venir mañana.
pues que iba a venir.
solamente porque ella sabe que yo no tengo a nadie quien cubra el puesto de ella.
cubrir.
whatever.
ella dijo que no go que no tenía nadie ahí que pudiera cover her.
aha.
y entonces dijo.
pero como sé que no tienen entonces yo vengo pero muy temprano.
así que o se consigue a alguien.
o se queda aquí sola.
bueno pero no no
so those are the exact words that I'm gonna use on Friday when I tell her.
no puede faltar allá más nada.

o sea me quedé dormida un día contigo ahí.
pero nadie se dio cuenta.
y nos quedamos profundos.
pero no era culpa de nosotros.
no no tiene diferencia ninguna.

yo no sería capaz de ver ahí.
y yo empezaría como que a pagar una mensualidad.

acabar de coger y
y hablar con ella

y hablar con tu papá.
o lo que sea para igual igual igual.
pues.
igual es como yo te dije baby.
qué.
a mí no me beneficia de nada que ellos siempre me estén diciendo que yo sea la que tengo que hacer más horas que todo el mundo porque soy manager.
no me sirve de nada.
de la hora.
not only that.
pero para tener que aguantarme a ellos.
all day long mi mamá.
oh you you are worthless.
oh my god no no no si no sabe hacer algo oh.
pero usted viene acá to do nothing.
mmhm.
so besides that yo le puedo decir a mi papá.
lo mejor que mi papá puede hacer es aceptar mis condiciones.
meaning que yo le diga a mi papá.
mira er is better if I find a person.
si me entiendes?
if I found a person that I could.
pero es que es es o eso.
eso eso.
o eso.

no puede ser.
del que se saltan completamente.
una de las dos personas.

puede ser.
que no te estoy grabando.
no entonces qué estás haciendo?
la grosera de la señorita.

this is.
alright she left these here for you to I guess process them or whatever.
mmhm.
right right.
whatever her it's she needs to sign it.
ok.
ok?
eh.
so everything is the same except the finances?
everything is the same porque we switched it from Citizens to Universal.
oh yeah ok.
everything's been switched.
ok ok.
entonces.
oh that's right uhuh ok.
this is gonna go with with the application to Universal this is going to go.
ok.
and then we're going to open a new file for finance which is something I think you guys don't have.
right no.
sí todo estaba junto.
ok.
well everything was together pero I for the past couple of things yo no mandé esto.
yo no mandé el contrato.
ok.
that's why en en los faxes que me venían eso like came in.
that's why lo están pidiendo.
exacto.
so we're gonna open new files.
mmhm.
ok he only has one one thing so we would do him en los folders más finitos.
mmhm.
ok.
and the blue ones that you gave me there right?
not we don't have to do the blue.
we can do.
oh any.
yeah she she just said yeah pa empezar.
ok ok.
so what you do is you put the policy on the right and the correspondence on the left.
mmhm.
mmhm.
ok.
so ya tú sabes aquí está todo junto.
mmhm.
sí sí que a la hora de buscar it's ok.
we're not.
we're and now it's going to be individual.
alright.
ok ok.
ok?
so that that'll work.
right.
y entonces ok so then we'll do that.
so
so I'll I'll put everything together and make a copy of everything.
mmhm.
y después esto va a ir separado que es en otro folder.
right.
which is gonna be a finance folder.
a finance ok.
you know so that's how this one is gonna be.
so I'm gonna leave that out there ok.
so pretty much yo creo que todas era esto
ok.
este se formó
tremendo lío.
tremenda lío.
really?
big time yeah.
pero bueno eso eso eso es y después te lo.
mmhm.
te lo cuento.
entonces también este este se va a tener que abrir in a commercial folder.
mmhm.

so esto yo lo
ok so yes.
so I'll figure that out then.
so we gotta keep this out yeah.
ajá.
y lo pongo esto aquí para hacer eso.
then what else?
so entonces these things are new.
and I just have to make sure to make copies of the things.
and then I'll put the the contracts to the side the finance contracts.
and then we'll do that new.
yes.
ok y eso ya creo que estaba aquí yes?
yes.
esto.
no.
I don't know.
there was something here.

so what did you guys do on the weekend?
uhuh.

baseball players and football players and
and there was three of them porque era él el hermano y Selina's son.
I know that one is super cute.

ajá exacto.
sí yo lo voy a hacer las copias.
I'm going to check the the before I send anything out I'm
exactly exactly.

and no that's why I had asked you if Sabrina called because I had left her a message for um the pictures.
I need the pictures for that Ricardo Hernández guy.
we got the payment on the credit card.
pero.
yes yeah it's it's mailed out.
and then Citizens sent me that fax thing that they sent.
so they needed the pictures.
and they needed um her phone number.
so I put the phone number on the mismo papel.
pero le tengo que mandar la foto.
and that's the message that I left her.
exactly porque eso es lo del mensaje so she's aware of it.
yeah so
did you guys make up already?
so that's that.
did you guys make up?
entonces esto I have to figure out what this is.
where it's coming from.
a sharpener?
no idea papi.
let me see.
no creo papi.
I don't think I have a sharpener here.
ya almorzaron?
bueno pero van van a venir a una a una hora decente?
let me check but I don't think I do.
you have to go?
you have to go?
ah ok.
yeah.
alright.

no lo apretes mucho abajo.
ajá.
oh ok.
yeah.
oh ok.
ok mamá.
ok ok.
you did it?
cool.
yeah.
no no tampoco así pero bueno.
ok ok that's fine.
ok bye bye.
alright so what are we doing now?
ok.
bueno ya.
so what else?
no ya.
so ya.
I already figured it out.
I'm just gonna go through this.
make sure we have everything.
make the copies.
separate the the finance agreements.
ok.
and then you know put them back there.
y este I'll have to see what the heck.
ok.
and then I asked her.
mmhm.
porque abajo de ahí yo me había encontrado todo.
mmhm.
there's a little more stuff down there.
yo esto también estaba aquí.
yes.
esto.
all this yeah.
this was all here.
so it's that new stuff?
is it old stuff?
what is it?
this is pretty new things that I have opened up.
ok.
yeah pero bueno esos son premiums too.
mira el Francisco ese que that's the file that's there.
ok.
but I have to figure out what it is.
because I wasn't sure.
yeah.
and then this thing this nightmare that just doesn't go away.
mmhm.
oh sí el de Luz.
yeah here's the thing.
mmhm.
oh wait this is mine.
this says x.
right.
ok it's not giving me a base flood zone.
but it wants it.
mm.
so I don't know what numbers esta esta otra mujer puso allá adentro.
so then.
sí porque entonces how do we know it's gonna be the same amount right?
exactly.
and then also the lender's requesting flood insurance even though property is in x zone.
mmhm.
pero why if it's in I I don't understand if it's in you know
mmhm.
right.
why?
and then.
like he's doing it like a precaution.
pero how do we know that?
exactly.
and then what's the value?
what's the charge on it right?
we need the appraisal no?
what's the amount?
yeah.
we don't know.
we don't.
I mean.
sí porque supuestamente nosotros teníamos un code o algo que fue lo que nosotros le mandamos.
o esto.
exactly.
pero adónde está?
because that was from.
I don't know if that's still in the computer.
I doubt very much.
sí yo lo dudo.
y era nada más que twenty eight thousand building?
yeah.
if if you do a quote without those numbers and only that building would it come up too at one eighty eight or?
the only thing that I'm thinking is that she did that preferred que the preferred is in an x zone.
mmhm.
entonces no te piden elevación.
oh.
that's the only thing.
pero que
and we can do that or?
yeah yeah.
we can do that ourselves so we don't need that.
when when you go in on basic standard it says standard quotes.
I think this one it says preferred something or the other.
en el mismo U S Security no?
yeah.
yeah yeah.
it's down here.
yeah because I checked this already to Us security so.
ah verdad verdad verdad.
you're exactly right.
three three three.
now?
ok now go to where it says quote.
no ok.
the P R P application the second one there.
P R P oh.
preferred no?
mmhm.
preferred something preferred risk.
no sé qué más.

ah and Immokalee is um um.
what we do is is we take Alligator Alley.
when we get to where the Seminole tribes are we go through that road there right where the gas station is.
follow that road.
and that's called Snake Road I think it's called.
and that goes in through their town.
and then from there we cross over I think it's into ah State Road thirty one eh or four thirty one.
and that takes us all the way across into Immokalee.
and then um.
yeah it's a it's a little town.
no I remember seeing the sign.
but I don't know exactly what it is.
it looks a little bit like um
I don't know.
it looks it looks a little bit like ah Naples.
ah something like that.
on the outer reaches of Naples.
cause it's not as uh as modern as Naples.
because it's imagine it's all uh agricultural.
yeah it's all agricultural.
and like I said the only thing there's there is just pretty much um Mexicans.
that's it.
they're all little people.
none of them go over four feet.
they're all tiny little people.

apart from donating a toy um you pay ten dollars per person to ride in the toy run.

después de que tú pasas todo eso.

I think fuimos como veinticinco para allá.
y you know porque en el grupo siempre there's those who who are very active.
and then there's a lot who just go to hang out.
and they leave.
they don't really stay.
yeah we have a club house.
we have a warehouse that we rent.
and then um
I'll show you pictures when we're done with the motor mouthing here.
yeah you can see all the pictures.
you can see the Valentine's picture.
and Halloween party.
yeah?
yeah uh you should see you should see how los viejos esos like Liliana.
no my god.
Liliana is is
Liliana enjoyed the trip to Canada also.
they call her nana.
they call her nana.
they call her nana.
yeah they don't even call her Liliana.
they call her nana.
everybody likes her.
ella llega allí.
and there's an old guy that he he's a an accountant?
sí ese Ron.
yes.
that guy he's always asking for her how she doing.
because she went to Canada with her.
she's unreal.
he's seventy one seventy one years old.
and Liliana rode with him on the bike.
and he looks good.
and he looks.
because he went alone.
yeah.
and then in the way back she drove with another guy from the club that he was alone also.
sí el el gaucho.
él le dice el gaucho porque es argentino.
ay dios mío.
sí ahora después que todas las cosas um I gotta pay off some things que nos quedan ahora.
de ella la niña.
once I get those things squared up boy I see see uh if we uh
a mí I get scared for her to be on a bike you know.
but she'll ride with us.
she'll ride with us.
I really do get scared.
oye allí allí pa que tú
even though I ride but I have respect to it you know.
you're not that you're not that well balanced.
I ride
you have to be
how do I say?
you have to be cut out for that.
because a lot of people cuando montan la la the motorcycles they believe that a motorcycle just by turning the wheel the motorcycle turns.
and you're going fast.
it doesn't work that.
no it doesn't work like that.
when you wanna turn you have to actually with your body turn the motorcycle because it actually wants to keep going straight.
so you know you turn the wheel.
yes you do.
but if you could actually turn.
and stop moving your feets.
la tienes loca.
tienes un reculillo.
come on.
the um the
reculillo tiene.
déjame sentarme aquí.
estoy más comoda aquí.
the bike actually you have to actually lean into the way you wanna go.
you have to push your body weight so the bike will go into the curves.
and now there's one old guy que he drove off the side of an expressway because we were coming up on the curve.
y parece que le cogió miedo la curva.
and he didn't lean into it.
se quedó recto on the bike.
and and what happens is is you do one of those like you know te va echando por un lado así like you're gonna fall off.
because you're afraid the bike's not gonna turn.
and he just went off the side of the road.
yeah that was before nos hicimos miembros nosotros.
or actually it was just about three weeks before nos hicimos miembros del club.
yeah del ah before we
yeah he broke he broke three ribs.
yeah.
poor thing I know.
y el el problema que tiene que la cogió miedo a la moto.
ahora está.
no pero you can't.
if you're gonna ride it you you can't be afraid of it.
because.
no you'll the the biggest problem why people
to be honest with you I'm scared of it.
I'm scared that I won't have the capacity to be able to ride it to learn how to ride it.
no I don't.
I dri I I ride behind him.
no she she she rides behind me.
and you know when he leans.
she actually doesn't need to grab on to me cause my bike it has a a a backrest for her.
so when I'm you know in the back relaxed when he turns I lean a little bit like with
yeah she's learning.
yeah she's not like when we first started.
so
yeah she would like you know when you get on the curve and if I'm going really fast you have to really lean in to it you know.
but you don't fall because it's all centrifical force.
so you you know you're actually leaning the bike pero you know.
you don't fall.
yeah.
yes.
and Alyssa she's gotten used to it.
yeah ella se
yeah I've gotten used to it.
ahora no le tengo miedo.
she she's getting she's
and we have a good time.
we went to también a Saint Augustine.
oh San Agustin we love it.
we went a big group.
Liliana went.
yeah.
Liliana went in her car.
yeah.
Liliana followed us in her car con Ana.
behind all of us.
locas.
with Ana with her friend.
fíjate que they gave them an honorary uh diploma.
a a a ella y a Ana.
I can show them to you.
I have them.
les regalaron un honorary diploma
te lo voy a enseñar.
del club for attending in the trip.
e iban las dos locas through the sunroof taking pictures.
they got so many pictures that it was amazing.
it was really nice.
yeah but we have
we had a great.
it's a lot of fun.
there's you know right now in the club there's a lot of controversy
it's worth it.
it is worth it.
people that like it.
because there's a lot of people.
and you can learn how to ride a bike good.
and you know you go easy.
you maintain the speed limit.
you do everything one behind the other one.
you don't have no problems.
ahora just for competition.
then you're going to have problems.
yeah there's people that race the bikes when we go through twenty seven.
just for racing.
you know I don't recommend it to anybody.
to anybody.
no they ride at close to a hundred and sixty miles an hour.
no.
we've been on our bike like we've we've gone up to about a hundred.
once you get used to cruising at seventy five eighty actually when you go slower it feels like nothing.
actually last weekend yo estaba haciendo signal para sacarle pie para to show that there was a dead otter in the middle of the road.
Aaron that's a good one.
and I took out my foot.
and you're supposed to actually you know if there's something on the road or some kind of an obstacle since everybody's riding together if you're in front the guys in back can't really see when they're coming up to it.
so what you're supposed to do is you're something on the road on your side you're supposed to put out your foot.
and to show you know.
you're not supposed to lay.
but apparently I calculated wrong.
and I left my foot down too far.
and I hit that damn otter.
I almost broke my leg.
yes.
I almost broke my leg.
it was really hard.
we're doing almost seventy miles an hour imagínate.
the pain that he had.
something laying there and then you kick it.
it was like
that los los viejos they were all cracking up because uh when we came back it was still there.
and he goes eh you know.
seguro que ese es la nutria.
in Spanish es una nutria.
seguro que la nutria ese dice.
coño me arrollaron y me mataron.
y ahora viene con una patata a mí.
coño hasta donde voy él.
and it was pretty big too.
mi madre.
it was big.
it was about like that.

huge sucker.
really that big it was?

everybody there's there's people in our age group.
and there's people that are older than us.

bueno tú primero te montas like we didn't know any one in the club.
when we went we were just fresh into the club.
what my dad?
my dad's been in the club already four years.
my dad my dad went into the club when I bought him his Harley.
I actually took him.
cause uh I asked the the people at the dealer.
and they told me.
no go see these people.
and we went there.
and I took him.
and you know when he first went in the first it was like.
you know.
pero empezaron a coger presión en eso en en
and he's he likes it.
we have we have issues in the club que they have to be worked out.
pero I'm pretty sure everybody has issues you know.
yeah.
yes.
and they they have they have a lot of people
it's a case right?
I can
the typical type problems.
yes.
que yeah there's people that don't want to pay their membership.
I don't like it.
or and then the membership in this place is is junk money.
and we have a club house.
and they're paying um
what do you call it?
I think it's eight dollars a month is what it comes out to.
that's nothing.
and then there's people that complain that that's too much money.
and I'm like you know.
give me a break.
you know that's that's not a lot of money.
and you have a place to go to.
it's every there every Friday.
después como.
and everybody that uh has a birthday they celebrate it over there.
everybody you can take bocaditos pastelitos.
you know everything the cake.
and everybody sings happy birthday to that person.
and you know they get all wild.
and you know.
and we have fun.
no they do.
so it's really nice.
there's a lot of there's a lot of uh like we went to Calle Ocho this weekend.
mama there's corn.
did you saw it?
and I believe we sold like six thousand five hundred dollars worth of beer.
in Calle Ocho.
yeah.
right now I believe active active active members I'd say there's about a hundred and forty that are active all the time going there.
there's actually um I imagine I'm member six hundred and something.
yeah six eighty four.
but what happens is is that a lot of the older people some have stopped going some don't go.
and those are some of the issues.
because what happens is these people get lost.
and then they come back.
and they don't pay membership for a couple of years.
and then they come back.
and they wanna pay their one year.
and then like if.
my dad was complaining.
he said.
no I don't think they should do that.
I say.
if you want your original number you have to pay back everything that you haven't been paying if you wanna keep your number.
or not we kill your number.
and you get a new number like the last person.
pero they they you know the president of the club no tú sabes he's real político.
he's a good person a very good person.
pero igual lo que pasó we had a camping trip.
when we went camping.
and um.
oh he went.
but I I didn't go.
she didn't wanna go.
I didn't wanna go no.
I had my plans for the weekend.
I had a bridal shower for that weekend on Sunday.
and then I said.
I'm not going to go you know early in a hurry to go camping.
and then pick up everything back.
we had a good time.
and then be all tired.
they took karaoke.
they took karaokes.
they took the karaoke.
they did barbeque.
everybody took their tents.
they did a lot of things.
and um one guy which.
your dad
wasn't a member of the club paid.
uh hadn't gone to the club for like three years.
and then showed up.
because he wanted to go to the camping.
siéntate a comer ahí mi amor.
he heard about it.
and um uh the president told him.
you can't go.
you're not an active member.
then he goes.
well if I pay can I go?
well he says.
yeah if you pay your membership you can go.
calentaste la arroz y el bistec?
he paid his his membership.
and uh he showed up in a camper.
cogiste maíz?
and his camper got stuck in the back all the way in the back of the of the thing.
it got stuck uh because it's humid over there.
and it got stuck in the ground.
and the presidente had to wait for him all day until they took his out with una grúa.
yeah.
and I said you know
and then he was complaining.
because he pulled out a big uh one of those big screen type T Vs one of the projection types.
and he was watching a movie.
and imagine we had tremenda música con esta tocando.
and everybody was singing and dancing.
and we were laughing jokes.
and he was complaining that the music was too loud.
and I said.
look.
you don't make the rules.
Snappy.
we are the ones that planned on doing all of this.
no le des que ya ella comió.
if you don't agree with us that's fine then you can leave.
but how you gonna be not even an active active member and then you gonna come and complain.
y entonces he was talking all kinda ah junk.
and I and I him.
you know I don't really appreciate that.
I don't think we should allow people like that.
we don't need people like that.
y este de verdad que tipo se ve que es un pesado de madre.
you know?
the other day he showed up at the club on Friday.
and uh he asked for water.
and they gave him a bottle of water.
give me a dollar.
he goes.
oh you gotta pay for the water?
what do you think?
you know this isn't this isn't a not for profit organization.
yeah you gotta pay for your stuff here like everybody else does.
oh I didn't think that was right.
give me a break man.
what do you think?
you gonna pay around a hundred dollars a year.
and you're gonna think you're gonna get free food every Friday here?
what's wrong with you?
what do you think?
that costs money.
yeah the food is six dollars.
you get your um whatever it is arroz un plato lleno de comida.
six bucks it's you can't beat it.
sometimes they have chicken wings.
sometimes they have french fries hamburgers.
it depends what.
sometimes people from the members will bring food.
they'll donate the food for that Friday.
yeah they can donate albóndigas lasagna depending what they do you know.
o.
with yuca and um carne asada.
the other day fue una señora que es española.
y hizo esta creo que es o whatever they do
los españoles.
and it was pretty good.
con arroz blanco.
and they had um
qué más hicieron?
she is actually putting of her own money.
like she.
yeah but I think that they
I don't know.
and so now what's happening is basically what they're saying is that in order for Barack to win like the entire election in order for him to become president he has to basically get her support.
mmhm.
so he can get so he can get the rest of the democrats that she has cause she has a couple.
they want him to get the rest of the democrats.
mmhm.
and if he gets the rest of the democrats that's it.
he becomes the next president.
oh my god.
yup.
has that ever even happened before?
a black president?
no.
no not a.
I know that much you know hello.
ok ok.
well I'm saying like has that ever happened before like when they like.
when when two people like running like that?
I'm not.
no I'm saying like that they already know who's gonna win from like before.
no no no it's not that they already know who's gonna win.
what's happened is basically that um they're running against each other within the same party.
mmhm.
like they're both on the same team if you will.
oh ok.
and basically like you know there's there comes a certain point when you you already know.
like they keep like you know like
oh ok ok ok no now I see what you're saying.
yeah.
so now they already know that he's the one that he's gonna be running for that team.
yeah yeah.
so there's no reason for her to still be there.
but she doesn't want to give up.
that sucks.
but whatever.
don't feel bad for her.
why you want you want Obama to win?
yeah I want Barack Obama to win.
in a way I want him to win too.
but then I was kind of like rooting for girl.

and I don't really want like for me to be the issue like between you and my mom.
you know like I don't want myself to come up in like anyway or form possible like.
mmhm.
and I was just kind of like.

mmhm.
yeah.
you know I don't have to say it.
but it's just like I think sometimes like it when I try to like talk to you and stuff like that like it can be taken as like ammunition you know to like.
ammunition what is what what do you mean by that?
like the fights can get worse just because you know like something might happen between us or whatever.
and I'm just like.
I just kind of felt bad because like the last thing that I want is for you and my mom to fight like over something stupid that happened between us you know.
yeah.
and I'm just like whatever.
kind of like the same.
yeah.
go ahead.
kind of like what?
no go ahead.
kind of like what I'm saying.
kind of like the reason you gave for not like doing that thing a long time ago when I asked you.
I'm trying to be like
yes.
yeah.
I'm trying to think.
it's kind of like the same reason that you gave her.
like you don't want like your relationship to go bad because of what happens between us basically.
ok.
you?
but um what was I gonna tell you?
but I wasn't mad at you.
like it doesn't make any sense.
think about it.
I mean you called me in order to talk to my mom.

and I picked up the phone.
I know.
I figured.
but I was just.
anyways it's ok.
I wasn't feeling to good on Sunday anyways.
oh ok alright.

you see you don't really know me like.
I mean I told you I was mad for like one day.
and then I was like forget it.
yeah.
yeah.
I didn't I didn't
I felt really bad.
but I just felt the whole thing was just misunderstood.
it was
yeah.
all right I don't want to talk about it any more.
it's like old.
whatever what did you do today?
what do you mean what did I do today?
what did you do all day?
uh I tried to get some more people.
like I made some phone calls.

and like I I've been doing a lot of reading.

yeah.
I didn't go to school today.

I couldn't get up.
I had like.
I don't know what was wrong with me this morning.
I had like allergies.

and I was so sleepy.
I couldn't open my eyes.
my alarm went off.
and I I woulda been late anyways.
and you and you stayed in bed?
yes I wake up at six thirty because I have class at eight.
and by the time I get ready and everything and traffic in the morning get on the highway like I get there like right on time.
I missed my alarm clock.

how much longer do you have to go?
I mean you're half way through the summer right?
no it's it's
yeah it ends I have like three more weeks.

and I shouldn't have missed today.
but the thing is like I shouldn't have missed it.
but I just couldn't get up.
and how do you feel now?
I don't know.
I feel good now.
like it went away.
it was weird.
it was a weird thing.
it was like a little phase or something.
the morning sickness.
but I shoulda went.
because I think I have a test on Thursday.
you're not pregnant are you?
no.
yes.
that's morning sickness.
you get up in the morning.

you're sick.
you're.
yeah I think I even threw up in the bathroom.
yeah there you go.
oh god you imagine?
oh my god that's crazy.
yeah that that that would be pretty funny.
but whatever um
yeah that would be funny.
yeah.
extremely funny that would be like
what like Je like uh Mary Mary Jesus funny?
I would have to be I would have to.
no no.
I would have to be like the the next like scientific study.
oh my god.
yeah I I don't think so.
so you like the radio station.
yeah it was good.
I'd never heard it before.
yeah it's really funny.
I listen to it now all the time.
I don't know it makes me laugh.
and there's like so much like good stuff.
like they talk about stuff like you heard like the stuff about and stuff like that.
mmhm mmhm mmhm.
they talk about politics.
good talks about politics.
not like that crap where it's like oh you know it's all over your head.
you know good politics.
yeah yeah.
and uh no they're always giving away money.
really?
yeah yeah yeah.
always giving away money.
I never heard it before.
they're the people that were giving away the tickets for the the concert.
oh for the concert.
yeah.
really?
I never called.
but I should have called.
yeah you should.
I probably woulda won some.
and I coulda gone by myself.
it's not funny.
I'm just joking.
no that's not funny.
I didn't even enjoy the concert god.
I can't believe you.
you that's the one thing that I really.
I was so mad.
I was like god.
that's the thing that makes me angry that I don't
why why?
cause the thing is like the the thing is like ok look.
let's be honest with each other.
like if I really wanted to go to the concert I would have gone regardless.
like I would have just bought the tickets.
mmhm.
like I would have just said.
forget Elizabeth I'm going.
ok I know where you're going with that.
ok but but like at the same time you know you know it's not just like you know going together.
I know.
that's not the point.
the point is going together and having a good time.
mmhm.
and I know you wanted to go to the concert.
so it was important you know that you had a good time.
yeah.
so when you tell me like.
oh I didn't even have a good time.
I was like.
I didn't.
it was
I was like.
great!
so like.
it was good because you know I got to go.
whatever and I saw her.
oh she did really good actually.
yeah?
yeah she looked really pretty.
yeah?
but
I felt bad.
because I knew like from you were like.
ah whatever.
I don't want to talk about it any more.
yes yes let's not let's not
anyways there will be more.
ok.
there will be more.
oh so now you're saying there will be more concerts.
yes.
there will be!
and I'm gonna make sure that you go that you go with me the next one.
because I feel really bad.
for that?
not for that.
but I know you wanted to go too so.
yeah ok.
no comment.
ok.
but anyways
so yeah that's all you did today?
um
yeah I kinda helped my parents out a little bit.
um I kinda figured that I would just be doing this.
so I was like ah you know whatever.
mmhm.
I've been studying for the for the G r e too.
you know like
yeah.
but like there's a lot of vocabulary in that thing.
I have like four hundred like index cards that I did.
additional index cards of like words and stuff like that so.
wow.
and like wow that's a lot of stuff.
like I've just been writing like this whole time like just putting all the words on index cards.
it's taking me forever.
mmhm.
wow.
so what are you what are you when are you planning to take that test?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I mean I thought I would be done by you know by mid June.
and I'm still like taking down like words you know so.
yeah.
I took a practice test though.
really how'd you do?
I got.
do you know yet or no?
I did better on the math than I did on the.
oh there's a math part?
yeah.
oh my god.
yes.
I hate math.
yea.
there's a and a math portion.
I did ok like.
I had not really studied.
I had just looked over everything really briefly.
mmhm.
but whatever.
like it's weird.
like the test basically like adapts itself to you.
like it asks you questions.
and then like if you get em wrong it asks it asks your an easier question.
mmhm.
and it goes like that.
it asks you hard questions and easier questions.
ok.
you know the C b t's like that.
really?
mmhm.
yeah.
if you like if if you take like let's say there's a question or whatever and like it's really hard and you get it wrong it like keeps lowering and stuff like up to like
or it asks you questions like if you're like stupid like.
you know I really wish you had come to that party.
really?
yeah.
I really do.
I wanted to come here but
it would have been it would have been a lot better.
I procrastinate on everything.
I think you know to be honest with you I think that given enough time like like you would have become like really like really really good friends I think.
yeah.
because we get along
yeah.
for the most part.
I'm nice.
I'm a nice person.
I'm not mean.
I'm nice to people.
who said anything about being mean?
you know I'm just saying I'm nice to people in general.
hey don't get a big head on me all right.
I'm not getting a big head.
I'm just saying like I'm nice.
like I even remember like in high school and stuff like the people that like the kids that nobody would wanna talk to like I would be.
aw.
no seriously.
you're a philanthropist.
even though I was pretty popular you know.
no seriously.
that's so messed up.
I would I would be one of those people like I would be like.
hi what's your name?
even though sometimes those kids they're really bitter.
oh of course of course.
they're really bitter.
but they used to be mean.
but I still was nice you know.
what about me?
I felt bad.
what you think I wasn't popular in high school?
no.
what what are you saying?
I didn't say nothing.
you said no.
that was a reaction.
no I wouldn't say like no I never thought that but
I was gonna tell you um.
I was actually really popular in middle school.
and then like because of how popular I was in middle school I decided that I didn't want to be popular any more.
really?
no seriously I was like really popular yeah.
it sounds funny though the way it's being said.
no it's true!
it happened.
it was something about my hair.
really?
it made me cool.
yeah.
cause I used to have like a a.
I told you this.
I used to have a lot of hair.
mmhm.
and it was like really curly.
and I used to put a lot of gel in it.
yeah.
so all the girls would be like.
oh let me touch your hair!
and I'd be like.
hey.
you know I like mohawks?
you like mohawks?
yeah I think they're so cool.
there's this guy in my social environment class
uhuh.
he has a mohawk.
I guess he used like wax or something.
yeah.
it's like really like slick.
like bees wax.
yeah.
yeah.
and I'm always looking at him.
I'm like.
oh my god I love your hair.
it's so cool.
yeah.
yeah.
so yeah like it used to get hard like after like after a certain time.
then in the afternoon it was like hard like all
yeah.
and it was like curled and stuff like that.
yeah I used to use more gel than I use now.
my hair used to be like rock hard.
like it was like
rock hard?
yeah it was bad.
I don't think it's not like like as you get older you realize that it's not necessary necessarily necessary.
you know?
yeah.
it's just something that you know it's cool like when you're growing up.
you're like.
oh.
you wanna do something with your hair.
so you start slicking it back.
and everybody's like.
oh watch out!
yeah.
yeah yeah yeah.
so are you so are you ready for the wedding?
am I ready for the wedding?
yeah.
you know I'm still trying to decide ah on how many days I'm gonna spend up there.
really?
yeah.
why?
my father's coming uh a little bit after my mom with my brother.
oh yeah I think you're mom told me something like that.
so he's only gonna be there for like three days.
so like the weekend basically.
yeah.
and I don't know whether I wanna like go in for like the entire week or just spend the weekend.
like I still haven't decided.
ok.
yeah.
I'm trying to figure that out.
the thing is like the thing is like once the thing is when you get up there you're gonna see like they're really like in wedding mode you know like.
wedding mode?
wedding mode.
you know so it's all about the wedding.
and like you feel out of place.
it's like you go.
and like you're a girl so you're gonna be fine.
and you're gonna
yeah.
you know they're gonna be like.
oh yeah you know help me put on this dress whatever.
let's go shopping for the shoes.
we still need this.
yeah.
and they're gonna take you with them.
they're gonna drag you up and down all over the place.
uhuh.
with guys it's different.
like you can't
like that you don't really get included you know like that.
you know you hang out with the other guys and
yeah yeah.
like I guess I guess the only reason to go would be to just get to know um Isabella a little bit better.
you know my Cynthia's son.
oh yeah.
yeah.
and probably Fernando because honestly like I don't know either of them like any of them like Luis you know junior Luis like.
mmhm.
and Fernando like I've met him.
and like talked to him like maybe like twice and stuff like that.
but I really haven't
I don't even know him that well you know.
my mom's spent like uh like two weeks up there.
yeah yeah.
like he took her out and whatever.
yeah.
they got to know each other so.
what about?
how do you feel about it?
I'm excited and nervous at the same time.
yeah?
I'm excited because I haven't been on vacation since like I went to go see my dad that was like two thousand one two thousand two I think.
yeah yeah.
yeah.
so I'm excited about going to the airport and stuff because I love the airport.
and I've never been to a wedding before.
you've never been to a wedding before?
never been to a wedding.
that's shocking.
so I'm excited to see what it's like you know.
that is shocking.
it's really nice.
it's really nice.
like you have a party.
it's it's nice.
yeah.
so I'm excited about that.
but I'm nervous because like oh my god.
I don't know twenty people and stuff so.
no I mean I mean for the most part like my mom tends to hang out with um uh Cynthia.
Cynthia.
mmhm mmhm.
so whatever you'll get to know her.
and Cynthia you already know.
yeah.
and Cynthia is just her sister you know so.
that's it.
yeah.
and then like on my father's side of the family I don't know what they're gonna do with that.
I don't know if they're gonna introduce you to my father's side of the family.
that remains to be seen.
like my mom doesn't.
like they get along.
but it's just like they're
they've had a lot of problems you know like.
a lot of stuff has happened.
yeah.
tough stuff with them.
my brother loves though you know.
oh yeah.
you know you can't get enough of them because they're they're more like
I guess they're more er um.
how can I say this.
urban centric.
you know more like he is.
yeah.
because he doesn't he doesn't take after like the whole Christian side you know.
and like Cynthia you know.
oh yeah yeah.
and Cynthia and their cities are more like Christian and stuff like that.
yeah.
I mean they're cool and stuff like that but
you know they're Christians so you can't you know certain things there are certain limits to what you can do you know.
yeah yeah.
but whatever we'll see we'll see how it goes.
yeah.
but yeah.
yeah the school's really big.
the school is really big?
yes.
yeah it kinda is.
it gets bigger all the time.
my school I kinda get lost sometimes in the school to be honest.
because I don't really do too much.
you just go in and study and come back.
go to class.
and sometimes I stay like you know like just relax and look around.
yeah.
when I when I'm when I'm not in a hurry to get home.
yeah.
why would you be in a hurry to get home?
that's exactly it.
I'm I'm not in a hurry.
I'm never in a hurry to get home.
I don't think I'm ever home.
that's the thing.
I think I only to go like sleep.
yeah.
you don't think you're ever home.
you know that's
it happens though.
it's not it's not just you.
a lot of people live like that.
yeah.
I know.
the to be honest with you like that's one of the things that I'm very grateful for right now that I have so much free time in the summer.
mmhm.
because I've come to realize that especially during these last two semesters at school like I've been spending just so much time like just doing crazy stuff like trying to get stuff done.
mmhm.
and always like hurrying.
and always being like you know.
trying to be like one step ahead of everything.
yeah yeah.
and I'm like
like I don't know like about maybe like a week ago is when I finally just like let go of all that.
you know just like just relax.
and finally just let it go.
yeah.
like you don't really have to do anything tomorrow you know just.
yeah.
and like I I rested.
and I was like.
I realize like man you know like man so much time like gets wasted on like you know watching television you know like looking stuff up on the internet.
something you don't even need to look up just like garbage.
yeah.
you know and it's like
yeah.
when I finally just let it go I was just like ah.
like I read an entire magazine like between yesterday and today.
yeah.
and I was like.
god.
oh this is great.
you know I read the entire magazine.
that's something really like oh my god like
so already have like your bachelors.
like I I wish I could already be there like.
I feel like school is like I like.
I mean it's not it's not enough.
I mean just having a bachelors is not
it's it's all about you.
you know it really is about you.
mmhm.
yeah.
you know like I I like the degree.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I think it's nice and everything.
but I don't think the degree defines who I am you know.
mmhm.
it's the degree is just a reflection of like my commitment you know of what I decided to do you know in my life you know.
like I already knew like that summer like when I came back to school that you know I was gonna finish.
one way or another I was gonna finish.
and the only thing that I kept telling me uh telling myself is like Colin you have four years left.
you know you just have to hang in there for four years.
just keep going.
yeah.
that's the only way I made it through.
there were times when like like I was like really messed up where it's like you know I had to stay up for like three a m in the morning four a m in the morning like writing a paper and stuff like that.
and it's hard.
it was funny.
last night I was talking to Maria for awhile.
and like.
yeah.
like we were just talking about it like man.
I was telling her the same thing I'm telling you like that I feel like I just started college.
and like oh my god like three more years.
and like not even because I haven't finished my first year yet.
and then she's like.
well you know think about like this like
she said that like
and it's the same it's the same thing I was thinking.
like in high school like when you were a freshman you were thinking the same thing.
mmhm.
you were just.
oh my god four years of high school.
it's gonna take forever.
right.
and like now it's like you think about it.
and like man it's already been a year that I'm out of high school.
hmm.
you know and it's like now you wish you could go back.
you know?
so it's like
I mean even though high school's very different from college.
but either way you know.
it just depends.
I mean there's a point in your life when you realize that
I like that's interesting that you say that.
because I don't really know what exactly it is about high school that you wanna go back like what it is about high school that you like so much.
that's the thing.
what it is about high school that I.
that's a very easy question ok.
what is it?
you don't have
in high school like everything was easy for everybody mostly everybody ok you.
you didn't you had responsibilities.
but not as big as the ones we have.
and ok I'm gonna be honest with you.
yeah.
in high school I barely remember it.
like I think the most times that I ever like opened a book was like three times
mmhm mmhm.
to study.
right.
you know?
and then in college I've had to learn like your your grade is based on tests.
mmhm.
you know if you don't open that book and read you're gonna fail.
right.
you know?
so it's like so then like I guess like in college now I'm kind of trying to like redeem myself for high school.
because I didn't do good in high school like.
right right.
I was an average student.
I I had like a what?
I graduated with like a two point like
right.
six or something a two point seven like.
when I was that actually my my my college G p a went down to a two point one so
yeah?
yeah.
but
no what am I.
wait.
two point one?
no what am I talking about.
one point a one point two.
yeah.
but I guess in a way like in college I'm trying to do my best that I can.
you know and then I realize I'm like.
cause I never thought like I would look at those like like smart kids and stuff.
and it's like nah.
and like I wish I could go back.
and like get like bright futures and all that crazy stuff and
well
it's it's
I don't think it's really about
I don't know.
I've been to people's houses that you know have have an education.
and they have several degrees.
and stuff like that.
and to be honest with you it's not
you know I look at their lives.
and and I don't really want that life.
you know like that's not what I want.
yeah.
you know I don't look at their lives and say like wow you know I envy that.
you know and that's what I want.
yeah.
um the only to me like the only motivation for me to like do well is is first for myself and also for you know for whatever future I might have with somebody else basically.
mmhm.
you know I think of it in that in that sense you know.
I I always wanna be I always have a backup plan you know.
I always wanna be prepared in case anything might happen.
yeah.
and it's just having a better life for you know for not just yourself but for other people too.
you know?
yeah.
you bring something to the table like you know whenever like you meet anybody.
so yeah but trust me.
just because you have an education doesn't mean squat like
it's true.
like that girl that I told you about that I like I went out for like a for like a month she was like she's working on her masters now and it's like like you just feel bad for her.
like honestly that's the only thing I can tell you.
like I felt bad for her.
because like there's nothing you can do like.
you know it's like she's thirty and she still hasn't figured out that you know if she doesn't like put on the batteries like she's just gonna be alone for like the rest of her life like.
oh my god you see that's something I don't want.
I don't wanna be alone.
my god she's like thirty.
and like she she just turned thirty.
and she's like still like going out like partying and drinking and stuff like that.
yeah.
and it's just like
I'm like
and like she's having such a hard time like letting go of like that part of her life.
like she's kinda like has like half and half right now.
my god.
so whatever I'm like whatever.
but that's you know that's that's her choice.
you know like that's her choice.
what happens with most people though is that um they don't realize that they don't really know what they want you know.
I actually asked this to my mom the other day.
like I was like.
tell me the truth.
when you were like young you know did you know what you want with your life?
and she was like.
no.
and I was like.
ah ha you see I knew it!
and I just walked away.
that's what happens though.
that's what happens.
that's why I try to think about that sometimes.
like man I hope I'm choosing like the right career.
and like
just the thing is
I'm trying to learn like one thing I'm trying to change about myself now is like
cause like you're though like these last couple of months man like it's been hitting me hard like.
like like now I'm trying to like realize like man like
I used to be so happy all the time you know.
and then like there like they used to be like like this these last couple of months I'm like oh my god.
and you know like I was thinking that this isn't me you know like.
mmhm.
I used to care but like not where I made it like
mmhm.
the centre of my life you know like.
you know why because what ends up happening is that eventually the problems that you might not have paid attention to like you eventually say to yourself.
yeah.
you know I gotta resolve them.
it happened to me too.
there are problems that you have to take care of.
yeah.
but I don't know.
like I'm I'm I'm good now.
I'm not
you just have to learn to be happy regardless of what you're doing.
yeah I know.
regardless of what you're doing.
you just have to learn how to do that.
like me it doesn't where you put me.
my mom laughs.
she's like.
it's fine.
you know you can come like a week before the wedding.
it doesn't matter.
we'll just put you in the living room with a book.
and you'll be fine.
yeah.
it's true.
so that's something that you have to learn.
like but whatever.
you know it's interesting.
what?
I dunno like
I think that sometimes that I think we try to get away from from feeling you know and and thinking about things about things that should matter.
you know?
you think?
I think so.
I think that that's the point of having so many distractions.
yeah.
for example I think that sometimes people get scared of being like absolutely alone like with nothing going on.
really?
yeah.
like people get like you put em in like for example have you.
what's the longest you've spent like by yourself with like nothing going on?
I don't even think like five minutes like I
you see.
you see.
I hate it.
like oh my god.
like.
but why?
I dunno.
why do you hate it?
that's one thing about me like that's like really like oh my god.
I hate being alone.
like I hate being alone.
I don't like being alone.
if I'm in my house and I'm like oh my god like there's nothing to do nobody here like I'm leaving.
you know like I would run
yeah you go do something else right.
I'm just gonna go for a drive or something and like blast my music.
I dunno it's like you know.
I I'm actually quite like the opposite.
like the thing is this like it's hard like it's hard to get to a place where you're just like you're alone like and you can actually think you know and just think about whatever comes into your head you know like.
mmhm.
you know why are things the way they are you know.
have all these like weird thoughts.
and it's like
I feel like most of your life you go through you go through it.
you know you just
people like yelling in your ear all the time.
that's what it feels like to me.
like it feels like people are always yelling at me.
you know like not literally.
you know what I mean like.
no like people literally yell at me all the time.
but that's what I feel like it's like it's happening.
like there's always like something going on.
and then we never get a chance to just like think.
yeah.
you know just like concentrate on like.
it's funny because it's like
I've been sitting around and thinking about the test you know and studying for it.
and I'm thinking to myself.
man you know it's taking so long.
I wanted to get it done in a month.
you know I was like.
mmhm.
yeah you know I'm gonna study for a month and that's it.
it's gonna be over and that's it.
I don't have to think about it any more.
yeah.
and you know what I've realized?
that the things that surround you make you want to like do things faster by not paying as much attention to them.
you know or not put as much value to them.
you know and I think it shouldn't be that way.
yeah.
I think that sometimes you really have to slow down and think about what it is that you have you know and appreciate it.
it's true.
but I don't think I don't think that a lot of people have that mentality.
well I don't think that a lot of people can even even think about that stuff.
I mean period so.
yeah.
you know what I what I found in the back of a magazine about three three days ago?
guess what I found?
?
guess what I found three days ago.
what?
um Popeye.
no way!
a D v d collection for Popeye.
really?
yeah.
ah.
oh I haven't seen Popeye in forever.
that used to be one of my favorite shows.
I know.
I know.
I know.
aw that's so cool.
I was like I looked at it.
and I was like.
hmm.
oh my god do you know what I used to watch a lot too?
I used to watch the Power rangers.
what?
yeah.
and the Ninja turtles.
Power rangers was when it first came out was really popular.
yeah.
a popular show.
aw I miss all those things.
and it's like it's is gone on like forever.
Power rangers is still on on the air.
yeah but
it's just in like weird like cable channels.
yeah but I don't think it would be the same as
oh.
or I don't know if it's
like ok because you like the other day.
not the other day.
but like like I would start like.
once like when I was in high school and I was like a freshman I was like man like
now like you know you see like Christmas and all those things.
yeah and like man the holidays the holidays any more.
do you think it's because you view it differently because you're older now?
like.
it has to do it has to do with the same thing that I told you about before.
because you don't put as much value to it as you used to.
oh yeah.
that's it?
it's been thirty minutes?
then get outta here.
we're having a conversation.
um I think it's for the same reason.
really?
yeah.
yeah.
so maybe it does have a little bit to do with people growing.
I think if you slow down I think it would be still as important.
cause it's not it's to be honest with you it is it's not about the presents.
it's really more about the feelings that you get and you know like what you want.
Christmas spirit.
yeah exactly.
yeah.
you know like that anxiety of like getting up at like twelve a m in the morning to open up your gift.
I used to love Christmas.
just because you want to see what your parents got you.
yeah.
I used to do that all the time.
I remember one time I got some like transformers.
and I was like.
transformers.
oh my god.
and I played with them like over and over.
you know um they started working on Transformers two like
oh the movie?
yeah like the first of June.
oh really?
I didn't know that.
yeah.
yeah they started working on it.
cause I was watching the the.
what's it called?

the one in Homestead.
the absolute worst theatre you can imagine.
the one in Homestead.
it's called Flagship cinemas.
oh my god yeah I I went in there once cause Kathy lives in Homestead.
oh my god.
we tried to go there one time.
but I never got to go inside inside.
oh it's terrible.

you are asking for trouble.
you mean the size of the arrow?
mhm.
but it does not always work because if you have a serious.
where I get particular is that all the text needs to line up.
because if you have them all the same length it may not work.
if the if the materials next to each other.
I I I'm more for making through all the text lines up.
to the right.
you know.

and you didn't take it.
they live in their own.
yeah but that was twenty some years ago.
things are a little bit different now.
ah oh.
everything.
because that's my nap time.
and when it's the afternoon's when I take my nap.

pero es que te quedas a dormir, te quedas.

one sunday morning I'll come sunday morning and we'll go there first.
sleep until one two o'clock in the afternoon.
entonces.
y me da vergüenza que más nunca la.
una sola vez la he ido a ver.
la mermelada de.
Billy me trajo una caja de mangos de que una amiga de ella se los dio para que yo hiciera la mermelada para ella.
really?
la hice la mermelada.
y la boté los otros días.
pues tuvo más de un año en la nevera.
oh.
yo eso no se lo iba a llevar.
oh.
y la anoté.
how do you do that?
dos pomos.
pero hay que usar una de mango.
pero es?
tú pones mango entero en agua hirviendo?
no.
los pongo en la batidora.
los pelo.
los hago pedazos.
los pongo en el en el blender.
con leche o agua o what?
eh?
con leche.
con qué?
ah ok así que.
no yo no le echo leche.
no?
es mango puro.
sin agua sin nada?
por eso saben tanto a mango.
oh well I see.
es puro mango.
pero hay que hacerlo en la batidora.
y después colarlo.
entonces después se le echa el azúcar.
y cuando está espesito se pone en pomo.
pero yo no pude ir a verla.
y se me hicieron viejos en la nevera.
los tuve que botar.
and Billy gave you that?
me trajo una caja de mangos Lini.
wow!
y de de una caja de mangos na más hiciste dos dos dos jarros nada más?
como quince mangos eché a perder.
wow!
oh!
y mangos grandes.
pero quince mangos te dieron nada más?
two jars?
aha.
mira así eran de grandes.
y eran dulces?
grandes y rindísimos riquísimos.
really?
shit!
una amiga de ella que trabaja en la corte con tu hermana se los regaló.
tú no sabes que ya la mata mía del mango ya no tie ya no la queda ni the stump.
le.
ella ella
sí ya yo la vi que la habían cortado eh?
ello.
Susie consiguió un par de negros trabajadores de barrio.
y tumbaron el shed.
ya no tenemos shed ni ni eso ni de.
toda esa selva que te había atrás lo quitaron todo.
sí.
sí yo lo vi.
pero óyeme la mata de mango esa que estaba muerta cuando yo la traje de tu casa.
yeah.
está bien viva.
really?
aha.
really?
coño!
mira si hubiera sabido la hubiéramos traído.
yeah we didn't think about it.
we'll do it next time.
porque yo tengo yo tengo una una cosa
porque yo necesito.
yo necesito sembrarla.
tú no sabes sembrarla.
, yo tengo una cosa con con tres pibos así que es como un como una pala.
que yo pienso vaya.
uno puede cogerlo.
y meterlo en la tierra.
y hacerle así.
y hacer un hueco así you know?
sí.
entonces meterlo así.
no.
y ya.
no verdad que yo no soy curioso para esas mierdas.
no ya no no.
y que hay que saber sembrar.
la mata se siembra.
según la raíz que tenga hay que abrir el hueco.
right.
entonces se le echa tierra buena como la que yo compro Miracle Grow.
entonces se le echa tierra buena.
tú les pones Miracle Grow a todo alrededor?
al otro también?
sí.
de hueco.
sí porque para que abajo con donde va a ir la raíz
y eso viene ya con su abono ahí ahí hecho.
sí.
sí.
y mierda mierda de gato no sirve?
sí.
no.
calla!
oh no!
no hombre no.
entonces después que le pongas el Miracle Grow le pones ahí la la de esto.
que te quede bien derechita.
y se le echa más Miracle Grow por arriba.
agua.
primero cuan en cuanto se hace el hueco primero es echar un poco de agua.
agua entonces Miracle Grow.
no así.
y entonces la mata.
y después y después agua otra vez.
después del Miracle Grow agua.
y después le puedes echar cualquier tierra que no esté con vitaminas ni nada.
tú has crecido tomates mucho?
una vez en en Nueva Yor.
pero cuando tú sacas ya la fruta o el vegetal lo que sea.
está guindada.
right.
normal.
y tú la sacas.
te dan más más tarde o no?
no.
ya que tú la sacas ya se jodió la cosa.
no ya.
oh!
ellos pueden parir dos veces.
pero no es
no es constantemente.
no.
como una mata de de de naranjas?
como los strawberries cuando.
yo compré en Nueva York catorce matas de strawberries por correo.
really?
no se me murió ni una.
really?
y cuando nosotros vinimos para acá en el ochenta y dos habían más de cincuenta matas de strawberry.
porque ellas mismas echan sus babies.
la la la la el strawberry echa una rama.
esa rama va a.
cae al piso.
y enseguida es otra mata.
really?
oye pero como yo tenía strawberry el señor de la imprenta el que era italiano él.
sí I remember.
el viejito metía así las manitos de él por las.
por las rejas!
por las rejas pobrecito.
y me dice.
strawberries.
el buenos días.
y yo le daba los buenos días.
y le decía.
mire váyase a trabajar.
porque él soli solito en la imprenta.
right.
él no tenía quien lo ayudara.
le decía.
váyase a trabajar que cuando yo le tenga su.
yo le ponía una bolsita.
y se la daba a él.
you know the.
oye no hay nada más fresco que eso right right there from the vine man!
ah sí sí.
pero le encantaban.
Ave María!
y yo lo que me llevaba para arriba lo hacía almíbar para mamá.
mamá le le gustaba.
tú lo hacías qué?
no mamá no los comía así.
tú sabes.
you have to mash it up.
eh tenía que ponerlos en el blender.
hacerle un puré.
y le ponía azúcar.
y le hacía como una
coño más azúcar todavía que ya tenía la mata?
no.
porque strawberry.
eran dulces pero no.
yeah I know!
no.
para hacer mermelada hay que echar un poquito de azúcar.
oh oh oh oh.
entonces yo cogía las tostadas.
y se las embarraba así.
coño qué vida.
ella le gustaba eso.
coño cualquiera!
le hacían daño si se lo comía crudo.
oh really?
así como strawberry jam es lo que tú estabas haciendo?
alright.
wow!
sí y.
ten cuidado que los que los jíbaros de aquí los americanos de hillbilly se hacen eso todo el tiempo.
claro.
jams you know.
yo sé pero yo lo.
de jelly de todo.
yo lo necesitaba aprovechar porque se me hicieron muchas matas.
yeah.
de catorce que yo compré aquello era que todo aquello en pedazos se había lo había cogido de la mata.
y eso sigue como un vine.
no.
no?
en todo.
no mira así es como crecen pequeñas.
no no van por la pared?
no ni dos pies.
ni dos pies no.
really?
coño entonces uno tiene que estar agachado cogiendo.
son bajitas.
pero cómo paren!
yeah?
tú las veías todas coloraditas por donde quieras.
pero fíjate aquí Juan me desilusionó porque me dijo que aquí no.
wow.
porque aquí claro como sembraba se lo comían los gusanos.
si uno no tiene la la tierra acondicionada así.
right claro!
pero yo siempre estoy echando.
si yo sé que tengo hormigas le echo cosas para las hormigas las compro.
vale y qué tú le echas para las hormigas?

yeah I know.
porque a mí se me infecta también.
yo eso no lo puedo
veo una.
y me me me erizo.
hasta las sigo a ver dónde se meten.
para ver dónde tienen el hueco.
no porque yo tengo un hombre que viene the cucaracha guy.

y le cogiste de pendejo entonces?
no sí pero n no él no lo sabe.

pobrecito.
so you killed a roach in the backyard and brought it in the house?
ay sí.
lo cogiste de comemierda a bit.

!
oye y ese se reía.
porque tu padre le gustaban esas cosas.

a mí no se me había ocurrido.
yo sabía que yo tenía que encontrar una encontrar la maldita cucaracha que él vio.
y matarla.
pero yo no lo vi.
no la vi.

eso fue de de.
y bueno y enseguida que a él se le ocurrió eso fuimos.

me llamó para darme las quejas de él.
de él?
qué sé.

pero yo le decía.
oye coge una escoba.
y mátala.
entonces dice.
sí pero es que no puedo coger la escoba porque está en la cocina.
y yo no sé dónde se había metido la condenada.
eso es que.
yo creo que ese fue el día que ella cogió una caja y le tiró la caja arriba.
él le metió una patada.
pues no lo mató.
estaba todavía moving a little bit.
ha ha.
esas no son fáciles de matar no?
she took a box and she put a box over it and put some shoes on top of it to hold the box down.
I swear to God!
in the middle of the kitchen.
y quién hizo eso?
Ellen Ellen.
tú no me digas.

no no no no Billy.
un abogado le estaba atravesándole el fondillo para que trabajara con ellos.
ella miró para arriba así en la oficina and saw a dead roach inside the glass there.
allí
dice.
hasta que tú no arregles eso no paso aquí otra vez.
el abogado tented the entire building para matar cuanta mie cuanta mierda había.
para que ella se quedara satisfecha mira lo que.
look I tented the entire.
le costó miles de pesos hacer eso.
and then then he went to work there after he was done tenting the building.
ah mira!
pues ya esa es otra buena.
esa pues no pero ella se pone en veta colora.
!
se le pone toda la piel llena de vetas coloradas pobrecita.
I don't know why she's so afraid of roaches.
la verdad es que no.
in Stanley Avenue that's all we had was roaches in that motherfucker boy.
da lástima.
no pero allá eran las alemanas que le llamaban.
the German roaches.
right I know.
sí.
y era por los vecinos de abajo.
en cuanto se mudó aquella cojita se acabaron las cucarachas en mi casa y en todo el verde porque era el apartamento de la cojita y el apartamento de nosotros.
oh yeah?
y entonces se sí yo hacía cosas para matarlas.
se iban para abajo.
the one downstairs?
y después volvían y así.
mmhm.
y no.
they went up and down and up and down.
pero ella me lo dijo.
ella fue la que tuvo la idea.
me dice.
Luisita cuando usted lo.
we have to do it both at the same time.
sí.
usted lo hace a las siete un día usted me avisa.
y yo lo hago en mi casa.
y así acabamos.
y se acabaron.
no habían ni en el hall se veía una así.

porque the sewer system has them in there porque.
I know I know.
yo nunca las he visto por ahí.
lo ponen ahí.
lo ponen ahí.
la única manera que esa cucaracha puede estar en mi casa sin morirse.
porque por todo el piso ellos tienen el veneno dos meses.
sí.
yo encuentro una buena y sana en mi casa es porque entró por por el sink.
te lo aseguro.
no yo por el sink no.
yo lo yo lo he visto salir del sink.
yo voy antes.
tú sabes lo que se meten por por el.

sí porque vio la mitad del snake ya saliendo.
llamó a la oficina.

pero entonces a una señora se estaba bañando.
y por la bañadera le le le salió una.
que tú haces.
no me muero.
I know!
no me muero.
o te rompes las dos patas.
el día del accidente yo tuve.
porque por eso fue que no me pudieron llevar en el helicóptero con Pablo.
porque yo tenía en trescientas quince mi presión.
wow!
me eh como la presión mía es emoti emocional.
oh.
y parece que del susto cuando yo me di cuenta de lo que me verdad había pasado.
porque como perdí el el el conocimiento yo no supe nada.
pero cuando yo vi todo el carro roto yo dije.
ah no entonces fue un accidente.
cuando vuelvo vengo para donde yo estaba sentado alante con Pablo veo que Pablo no es no puede hablar ni ni ni podía abrir los ojos ni nada.
pero por qué te empecé yo a decir esto?
por la presión.
oh por la presión.
todo cuando yo me quejé y llorando le decía al al hombre del del rescue.
dos de ustedes me dijeron que me iban a poner en el helicóptero con mi esposo.
y yo no me quiero separar de mi esposo.
me dicen.
señora usted tiene tan alta la presión que no podíamos ponerla en eso.
hmm.
le digo.
qué alta la tengo?
porque yo no no no pensaba
y no te sentiste nada?
no no es que yo cuando me sube mucho la presión lo sé enseguida.
pero ese día como estaba tan nerviosa yo no.
y entonces me dice.
usted tiene trescientas quince de presión señora.
y ahí fue donde me di cuenta que ellos no me podían poner el.
right.
pero qué va no!
fue terrible!
y el día primero de este mes cumplíamos nosotros dos años de casados.
dos años de I know.
I know.
qué cosa!

ya olvídate ya no hay remedio.
I'm stuck with that bitch now!
pero yo le dije oye por lo plano.

podías mira eso eh.
eso es una cosa muy ofensiva.
tú no vas a comprar un ser humano.
no.
no vaya!
no no no no no no.
pues yo yo yo yo eh yo yo me porto bien con ella.
no mira un día.
lo único que no puede mirar televisión ni hablar por teléfono ni hablar con los vecinos porque si no la la la va.
no this is how to rule her man!
el momento que que que sabe de novelas y de jodiendas y esto no hay no no.
ay no no hombre no!
qué tú te crees?
es un ser humano.
I know.
I'll be nice to her don't worry.
el el hombre que se queda solo.
I'll feed her every day.
mira Pablo pasó diez años viudo.
ese hombre estaba delgadito mal atendido
toda la ropa lo mandaba al dry cleaner.
cuándo se iba a lavarlo?
eh?
porque no sabía lavarlo.
no no sabía poner la máquina de lavar.
ni yo tampoco.
coño cuando Patty me dejó.
no mira la esposa de López fue muy buena mujer.
por eso yo el día veinte de marzo que ella hubiera cumplido años no?
you wanna bring her flowers?
porque ella nació el día veinte de marzo.
yo voy a ir al cementerio a llevarle flores como antes yo lo.
eh siempre teníamos bien la tumba porque ella fue muy buena con él.
ella le picaba hasta el bisté.
really?
él tenía sus dos manos.
pero ella no ella le picaba el bisté.
y ella se murió de cancer no?
ella murió de cancer en el esófago.
you know who Patrick Swayze is?
eh?
es un actor muy buena gente.
se llama Patrick Swayze.
dicen que tiene pancreatic cancer.
oh sí ese no dura mucho.
ooh that's bad!
no dura mucho porque mira Rosana cuando vino de Cuba del último viaje me dice una carta bueno me decía que había venido con un dolor pero que iba a ir al otro día al médico.
cuando tuvo el resultado me llamó.
y me dijo lo que era.
era cancer.
y el médico le dijo a Pedro que es médico.
ah que es el casado con la sobrina de de Rosana.
le dijo.
si fuera mi abuela le daba dinero para que se fuera a viajar si le gusta viajar porque ella lo que le quedarán de de largo tres meses de vida.
nunca les dan mucho más de tres meses.
a ningún paciente de cancer.
a ningún paciente de cancer.
ay ese hombre que tú dices que tiene cancer ahora.
el artista ese.
ese no dura ni seis meses.
that's too bad porque es buena gente el maricón.
no es uno de esos que que forma problemas y jodiendas you know?
sí pero es pero es que el cancer eh del páncreas.
el nombre.
el páncreas es el que hace la insulina.
right.
por eso son los diabéticos cuando.
right I know.
entonces.
eh el páncreas eh como que los um
como que el cancer en el páncreas avanza más rápido.
hace más daño que en otros órganos de la persona.
porque por ejemplo el el hígado se puede poner un pedazo.
right.
te quitan un pedazo.
y el hígado crece otra vez.
when you can live right right.
pero el páncreas no.
y ese hombre yo lo vi anoche en la televisión.
no yo no creo que dure ni seis meses.
ah that's too bad.
ni seis meses va a durar.
él dice que le va bien el tratamiento pero
así dicen los doctores pero you know
sí.
ojalá que viva muchos años más!
eh la señora de de Pablo no duró mucho.
no?
no.
ella fue al médico.
cuando llegó ella le dijo a él que lo que tenía era cancer.
y no duró ni cuatro ni cuatro meses duró.
la esposa de Pablo?
qué duro!
sí.
y él se deshizo de todo porque tenía una compañía.
ellos tenían dos de esos grandes para cortar hierba.
y hicieron bastante dinero pero bueno.
tú sabes que Pablo tuvo siete casas propias?
wow!
que las alquilaban.
con todo eso parece que lo vendieron.
y el hijo se ha quedado con todo el dinero con la casa de.
pero la de ya le había hecho un traspaso a la hija.
unos criminales.
valga que ni me han llamado por teléfono.
a mí que no me molesten.
porque no yo no quiero saber ya de esa gente.
pero el dinero que tengo perdido en esa cuenta yo voy a ir a esa corte.
aunque vaya sola.
porque me dice Juan que es un barrio muy malo que
la corte?
la misma corte donde tú donde tú te casaste?
o you wanna go to Flagler Street?
no es que tengo que ir a Flagler Street.
oh really?
yo fui a la co a la corte donde yo me casé con Pablo.
and they couldn't do it there?
pero allí me dijeron que no que no me podían ayudar en eso pero que me iban a dar la dirección de donde yo tenía que ir.
que yo tenía que ir al civil court.
y yo le dije.
pero yo no sé dónde está el civil court!
y me dijo.
mire yo le voy a dar la dirección.
y vino.
one forty Flagler I think it is.
ah.
entonces cuando Juan me fue a llevar a ca fue a casa para llevarme a la corte esa me dice.
mami yo he venido a llevarte.
pero una cosa tú eres muy nerviosa.
tú sabes como te dije hoy cuando nosotros estábamos buscando aquella noche un lugar para comer y yo vi tanta gente maleante.
porque no sé se lo conozco en la cara a la gente.
yeah I know yeah I know.
y yo vi tanta gente maleante.
y tú me decías que eran hasta prostitutas.
es claro.
yo dije.
ahí yo me voy a pegar una cosa como esta no no.
y cogí esa esa.
no te dije nada cuando tú me dijiste que eran prostitutas algunas de ellas.
yo dije.
ahí no yo no.
pero no te dije nada.
pero se me hizo una cosa en el estómago que el hambre se me fue lejos.
ya no tenías hambre!
no no comí nada no comí nada!
no!
creo que lo que pedí fue un helado.
we stopped at a Pollo Tropical finally didn't we?
no.
yes!
no fuimos a un lugar donde había.
un Pollo Tropical?
I remember.
no.
you went outside to smoke.
you were still smoking back then.
and I took you out.
you went outside to smoke.
I left you in the corner.
I said.
párate ahí so I watch you from the window.
remember?
y fue horrible.
horrible esa noche.
ya ya se me quitó el hambre.
entonces él me dice.
tú eres una persona muy muy nerviosa mamá.
y no te gustan las cosas
a mí un bar un barrio no me gusta.
no me gusta pasar por ahí.
me parece como que
no es que me hagan algo.
es que si se reúnen varias personas yo no puedo defenderme.
con una sola no me importa.
will you kick his ass?
pero eh sí pero a ella no.
!
pero barrios no.
no no no no.
ah ok.
no.
how many can you beat up at one time ma?
I don't know!
I beat up
at one time I beat up six guys one time when I was a transit cop.
sí pero tú eras grande!
y tenías un palo así para defenderte.
!
yo metí balazos coño!
coño como yo metí balazos cojones.
como van a aprender malas palabras.
hoy e hoy e hoy en día hay uno hijo de puta ma caminando por allá en Brooklyn.
todos todos cogidos todos jodidos de las las palizas que yo las he metido.
sí.
trust me.
oh yeah!
oh yeah!
no una vez yo llevaba un Mace en la cartera.
yeah and?
y siempre siempre que yo me lucía a alguien que estaba tú sabes peligroso.
little bit funny.
sí en Nueva York todo era con abrigo no?
y tenía siempre bolsillos.
yo sacaba mi Mace.
y me lo metía así en el bolsillo.
decía.
si este desgraciado me viene a hacer algo va a saber quién soy yo.
!
aha
porque no es lo que me lleven.
es lo que me pueden hacer.
right.
porque si te llevan una prenda la prenda yo puedo comprar otra vez.
right.
pero no no si me no si me tiran al piso.
mira hace como dos años una señora donde yo vivo se fue a a holy a holy rosary a la misa de siete.
y tú me puedes creer que la han cogido dos hombres esperando a una pobre mujer vieja ya.
yo no sé la verdad qué tendría.
pero no era ninguna joven.
vive vive en  River.
entonces pues la la le quitaron unas llaves a la fuerza.
la esperaron que ella estaba para abrir el carro.
ahí la atacaron.
le cogieron la cartera.
como ella no quería dejar la cartera la tiraron al piso!
oh my god!
y le partieron un brazo en dos partes.
oh shit!
tú sabes cómo esa mujer sufrió?
y eso es lo que yo trato de evitar que me hagan daño a mí.
como tú una vez me dijiste en Nueva York.
mami.
no usar carteras caras.
y era verdad porque Rosana como cost le le valían hasta doscientos y pico pesos y trescientos una cartera la carteriaron tres veces en el en el en el
en el subway.
en el subway.
y era porque veían que las carteras eran buenas.
eran caras right.
pues tenían que.
una vez le robaron hasta un sobre con prendas que tenía.
oh shit!
allí.
tú no sabes que yo tuve un caso un día una vieja americana.
entrando en su casa lo mismo le pasó.
la tumbaron al piso.
entonces le robaron la carro.
la la arrollaron with the car.
I know.
wait a minute!
mira el brazo aquí.
este tiene el brazo más grueso que este.
la goma pasó por arriba.
!
y el brazo se le explotó.
se explotó.
estábamos todo ripiado para siempre.
probablemente lo perdió.
but it.
no they saved it.
ella tenía era vieja como ella sola.
ochenta y pico años tenía.
y la arrollaron con el mismo carro de ella la la arrollaron el brazo.
and the arm exploded.
la carne la sangre everything went flying out like this.
qué criminales!
y esto estaba todo ripiado así.
qué criminales!
me dio una rabia coño.
vaya que yo como
I hated those sons of bitches.
I'll tell you the truth.
I hated them.
and they didn't like me very much either.
but I hated them with a passion boy!
por eso y eh Susie eh Susie saw it.
I said.
look!
when Susie saw that I was going after somebody she says.
goodbye!
I'll see you when you catch them.
because I would not come home until I got that son of bitch in jail.
I would not come home.
I would not come home until I.
I would sleep in the van like a bum.
I would sleep in my van like a bum.
shave in the courthouse and shit.
I'm serious!
I would take a change of clothing.
y y me lavaba los sobacos no shit.
and I'd keep on fucking going.
sí.
no no no.
until I caught those sons of bitches.
pero qué criminal!
bueno esa señora sufrió bastante porque imagínate dos fracturas en un solo brazo.
entonces.
y ya después de viejo eso no es eso no es ningún relajo.
eso es ningún relajo.
pero los viejos no nos curamos fácil mi hijo.
como mucho un niño se rompe una pierna.
y a y al y a los tres meses ya está caminando como si na.
porque esos huesos están jovencitos están.
right y se y se y se curan de na.
pero los viejos no.
y yo les tengo terror.
mira los otros días
como ya veo que las cosas se están poniendo tan mal hasta hasta esperando una guagua una muere en estado que la cojan y la ultrajen.
no I know.
no eso de eso no tie.
está habiendo tantas mujeres botadas por ahí.
entonces ah me fui a un lugar.
y veo como el que tú me regalaste el mismo pito que tú me regalaste en Nueva York.
oh yeah the metal one.
compré uno.
yeah?
que es de es de bronce.
pero está.
where did you buy it?
dónde lo conseguiste?
en la Vía Rica en la Vía Amiga María de al lado.
oh really?
ah ok.
sí hecho mejor hecho en Inglaterra no.
en Inglaterra está hecho.
entonces lo voy a limpiar bien para ponérmelo en la cadena gruesa.
y lo voy a guindar en la cadena gruesa que tengo ves?
aquí lo voy a.
mira.
aquí como tengo esa de cada día lo.
entonces si algo pasa si ya yo como hacía con el Mace en Nueva York que enseguida me lo sacaba de la cartera y me lo ponía.
lo voy a tener aquí en esta cadena.
y empiezo a silbar como si
aha.
no.
ay coño!
por lo menos tratar de
porque a lo mejor se amedrenta la persona si uno uno empieza a sonar un pito.
la persona ves?
voy a la comandancia con unos perros.
no.
ayer mismo yo estoy planchando en la sala.
y así tú verás la la la puerta está aquí y yo aquí parada planchando.
right.
siento una cosa como que se me hubieran tirado algo en la puerta.
podía ser el viento también.
y yo pensé no pensé que era el gato que se había pirado.
pero él nunca hace eso.
cuando fui a la ventana y miré no estaba el gato por ahí.
lo que fue no sé.
it was the wind.
the wind does that a lot.
happens at my house all the time.
you feel the door como si alguien está tratando de abrir la puerta.
aha.
but just pushing on it you know?
aha.
es descarado.
pues yo enseguida fui.
y miré.
entonces no no había nadie.
no había nadie.
pero era diferente cuando yo tenía a Mac.
cuando yo tenía el perrito enseguida ladraba.
normal.
y t y tú sabías que estaba a alguien tocando.
pero ahora sin el perro.
veremos a ver si algún día.
tú nunca has visto los perros de Herbert Dole?
no.
ma son así de de chiquitos.
son como Mac.
pero parecen parecen ratones.
de veras?
little itty bitty man they call teacup.
oye pero tú te acuerdas aquella señora que tenía un perrito así y yo le pregunté si si lo vendía.
y me dijo que no?
no.
eso eso después que salimos de allí tú me dices.
ese perro vale mil y pico pesos.
oh yeah yeah yeah!
!
we saw one at the flea market near Sally's house.
uno negro pare parecía pelo de yuppie.
negro chiquitito así!
mil cuatrocientos pesos.
ah.
mil cuatrocientos pesos.
oh wow!
y el hermano mil quinientos.
y tenía un tenía un otro perrito que era blanco pero estaba rosado rosado rosado pink.

hey where did that pink dog come from?
no that dog is white.
but I was baking a cake the other day sonofabitch fell on the filling!
she had a big thing of.
porque the icing of the cake was pink was for a girl's birthday.
sí.
and the dog was licking it and fell in the fucking pot!
!

no este a mí me gustaría uno chiquito.
pero no donde yo vivo porque donde yo vivo tendría que iba a.
la gente es descarada tú sabes.
pasa por ahí
un día yo salí.
y le digo.
señora usted no está en su puerta.
ni con leash pasaba ese perro por aquí.
es por aquella cerca que usted está su puerta pasa.
porque si ese perro hace sus necesidades aquí usted no tiene nada en sus manos para recogerlo.
lo va a dejar ahí?
claro qué tú crees?
no pues no no es tan supuesto.
tú sabes que en Nueva York tú tienes que ir con un periódico o con uno.
oh a scooper thing.
aha.
porque no eso no está bien.
eso no está bien.
y es no respetar a los demás personas.
no!
y no la he visto más.
nunca pasó.
yeah?
that's the last time huh?
más nunca pasó por ahí.
eh oye eso tiene catorce buildings.
que se vaya por otro building a hacer esa gracia.
hmm.
cuando yo me mudé ahí.
yo todavía tengo esos papeles de tantos años que he vivido ahí.
que nos dijeron a mí y a tu padre que en paz descanse mire.
usted tiene que cruzar.
los perros se p se pasean por la por el por el fence más alto que hay.
que ese es de ocho pies.
right.
pues por qué la gente no se lo dicen a todo el mundo y que todo el mundo obedezca eso?
ah no pues que lo pasan por allí.
porque la gente hacen lo que sale de los huevos that's why.
ah!
no.
no pero eso eso es ahí chunguero.
tú crees?
sí sí sí ya
vamos mira cuando me me dijeron de eso de la estufa yo les dije.
pues mire yo le tengo miedo a esa estufa.
yo no voy a que un día me coja la corriente o que haya un accidente aquí.
porque eso es dos veinte.
that's not one twenty.
aha.
entonces me puedo electrocutar con eso.
no yo no voy a limpiar esa estufa por dentro.
nada más por dentro limpio esta parte que usted ve limpia.
lo demás no lo limpio porque ahí están los cables y.
yo no voy a

pero ahora cuando le llevo el de esto de Home Depot.
me dice enseguida el que me había dicho que era de veintitrés no sé cuánto.
eh me dice él.
sí pero es que esta estufa es grande.
ya me había dicho que Macy no la tenía chiquita.
en Sears.
que solamente eran grandes en Sears.
digo.
bueno si eso es donde yo tengo crédito.
entonces yo voy a Home Depot.
mi hijo me la compra en Home Depot.
y yo le podía pagando lo que sea.
tampoco Home Depot las tienen chiquita.
they're all big.
mira para ese.
donde tú tú puedes conseguir eso?
en Brands Mart.
lo bueno es que es que que que vaya uno tiene que usar una tarjeta de crédito normal pa pagarlo cash.
pero son baratos.
fíjate yo he comprado un freezer right el freezer que tengo en la casa ahora?
bueno no.
por menos d menos de doscientos pesos.
un un freezer así.
pero es una tienda de nueva?
yeah Brands Mart.
de veras?
one ninety seven we paid for that thing.
they come two hundred dollars.
aha pues sí.
mira tú sabes otra cosa que yo necesito?
la televisión de la sala.
la televisión de la sala.
me da pena.
me da lástima porque esa televisión en un especial costó cuatrocientos y pico pesos.

y la compró tu.
y cuántos años tiene?
la compró tu padre como dos meses antes de morir.
so él está muerto tres años no?
ya está.
cinco.
cinco años ya?

o ocho años por ahí.
como seis años va a tener.
bueno.
no seis años sí.
y ya te está dando los problemas no?
muchas veces se enciende sola!
coño!
la botamos para la mierda.
entonces no puedo.
ya le dije eso a Billy.
pero como me dice que en un año más que esa televisión ya no hubiera servido para nada.
right.
entonces le di le digo.
vamos entonces no la boto porque para qué hago comprar otra así que en un año o menos de un año ya no me sirva?
oh pues de H D and the digital bullshit era eso?
right.
no tú tienes cable no?
sí.
but that doesn't matter.
the cable company takes care of that.
you can have any T V you want.
entonces yo estaba pensando en comprarme una de esas que son flaquitas.
oh a flat screen?
sí de las pequeñas mi hijo yo no la quiero grande.
coño!
cara baby.
very expensive.
muy trescientos cuatrocientos cuatrocientos pesos facilito.
bueno cuatrocientos y pico costó eh la que voy a tener que botar.
I know.
but you don't have that kind of money ma.
you can't afford a T V like that.
cuatrocientos y pico pesos?
yeah.
tú no tú no encuentras cuatrocientos y pico pesos caro?
bueno esa costó cuatrocientos no sé cuánto.
tu padre me dijo.

y tráeme los cuatrocientos pesos.

y yo quiero esta televisión.
y se la dio en un pedazo periódico.
y Dan le llevó la la televisión.
rompió la caja.
nos instaló la televisión.
y todo eso se le dio algo a él por eso.
se portó bien entonces el Dan ese.
oh sí claro que sí.
oh good.
fue una gran persona.
y el día que él fue a casa y vio que Tito tenía oxígeno la máquina de oxígeno me dijo.
ay yo no sabía.
Mrs Ava yo no sabía que Tito estaba en esas condiciones.
yo le decía.
hace un tiempito que que ya él necesita oxígeno todo el tiempo.
y me dice.

that they're strict yeah.

yes.
is she the only child?
ah no she has a little brother.
but she's the only girl.
she's the only girl.
they don't want her to be around the influences of your sister.
whatever she has.
they don't want her to catch it.

I'm talking going out.
why do I need to take care of you?
yeah I don't need to babies.
I don't need to take care of you.

that's why she she doesn't drink.
ella no puede tomar.

I'm sure anybody could drink in that club though.
I'm sure about it.
they probably put a a twenty one year old ban on everyone.
just just going going.

you don't understand him.
he blows up at the at the smallest things.
at the littlest things he blows up.
I go.
because he's a spoiled brat.
things go like this a little bit out.
she goes.
and then the huge things that are really important you don't know how he's taking it.
and then she looks.
and she goes.
I guess we're all small things to him!
we're sitting there cracking up Mandy.
except for Mandy you both are.
why?
because Wendy's tall.
yeah but he still gangs up on her.
you know how he blows up.
no I know.
I know.
oh my god.
pero qué de eso.
I was like.
oh god you know.
are you kidding Trevor today.

I wasn't here a minute ago you know when you came by.
yeah.
I said.
the computer was on
I thought it was you.
he goes.
I could have sworn I shut it off.
I said.
it was on when I got here.
maybe they were working on it.
I didn't do it.
yeah maybe the guy.
like they were doing yours.
well because he's been having problems with his.
yeah.
so they probably worked on it.
so hopefully.
yeah they tried to fix it.
so entonces you know I do like the things he had picked up and stuff.

and I go.
my computer's working.
so I guess I'm gonna go ahead and go back.
I'm gonna answer emails.
input all the new purchases that we just did into my spreadsheet because I was able to get everything.
like it wasn't the hard drive.
all right.
it was the memory.
oh yeah they they needed to put more.
so
right so I just went ahead.
and um I did all of that.
and then I was sitting there.
Martha was telling me.
and it's what it is.
even though I I tú sabes.
yeah.
so I don't get any of her things.
I guess it's a little bit of that.
oh that's probably what it is.
because ella estaba she showed me a picture of her daughter.

she doesn't look eighteen.
she looks older.
pero una muchachita linda.
I go.

right.
but like they know she's the step-mom.
and she is the one that actually goes in because like I guess the mom's a scaredy cat.
so she's the one that goes in with him.
y él se lleva muy bien con ella.
so entonces he was like él ella le él le dice Lucy.
you know her name is not Lucy
but ok.

and that's that's her daughter's name.
ok.
go figure.
so

unless Lucy's her middle name.
yeah mid middle name.
entonces él le dice Lucy tú entras conmigo so she left her daughter outside.
and she he she goes.
so I did what I like to do for a whole hour.
she goes.
afterwards.
it was because for a whole hour she was sitting there talking to him while they were doing the M r i.

she goes.
so it's not looking in.

she goes.
but apparently they think.
so entonces she kept telling the guy.

she gave them the cell phone the work number you know.
apparently he ended up calling her.
oh really?
er her stepson called her.
and said um and said that the doctor had called him.
and she goes.

I really tried for them not to tell you.

yeah.
tomorrow when we go to the biopsy that's the one that's for real.
yeah.
you know tomorrow for the biopsy that's the one that really counts.
oh my god.
but apparently he doesn't want his mom and dad to know.
I guess not yet.
right.
so um so she's like.
don't worry.
I won't tell them you know.
so if you don't wanna tell them I won't say anything either.
so ella tenía una cara pobrecita!
so I I was like you.
I did what Mary said.
cogí una cascarilla.
and I put it behind my neck.
pero con todo y eso when you ask I could still feel it a little bit.
and I'm like.
you know what I'm gonna have to take.

I went.
and I got era hoy chickpeas um sopa de garbanzos.

uhuh.
yeah.
sopa de garbanzos.
so I had that.
and I ordered café con leche with no sugar.
but it was hot as heck so I had to wait.
entonces I kept putting off taking aspirins.
because I was like.
you know I'm gonna I'm gonna see.
yeah I'll do it.
and que le tuvieron que le tu.
right I'm gonna I'm gonna wait you know.
afterwards I'm like.
you know what?
I might as well take it because I don't wanna like yesterday.
that was today?
that was today.
oh.
and then I said.
did you know.
cuando ya se paró ir al baño.
cogí el spray.
y empecé a echar.
I'm like.
you know.
quédate para allá.
you know not over here so.
yeah.
oh my god.
I don't know.
I mean ella la pobre she's not a bad person.
no but they're negative.
you've gotta run in the other direction como dice Mia.
yeah.
I know.
she was telling.
who was she telling that?
she was telling
was it Mia or er?
yeah she told that guy that one time when we were out.
no but she said it yesterday too.
oh I didn't.
she told somebody.
I don't know if it was with us or with Emily.
you know what?
when you see people like that you run in the other direction.
you don't wanna be there.
or was it Caroline?
they were saying that.
maybe it was Caroline.
she goes.
you don't wanna be.
oh Caroline is so funny.
I have to call her.
qué hizo ahora?
oh my god she called at eight thirty this morning.
but I didn't hear the phone.
and then I heard a message.
I go because I had put the phone on low yesterday on silent.
right.
and I see a missed call and a message.
and she goes.
oh Sam I need to talk to you.
um I found a website with the.
and I think there's you should check it out because I'm not too sure that's a good energy.
me dice.
y entonces I laughed.
so Mary writes to me Mary writes to me.
and she goes.
oh boy I've got a call from Caroline.
so it wasn't just you.
she called her too.
everybody.
eight thirty in the morning.
oh my god.
and Mary picked up the phone.
and she told her.
oh I need to talk to you because I don't know.
you need to check this out.
we need to have a conversation.
I don't think it's that good.
you need to be aware.
she goes.
she called to warn me.
and I was like.
are you kidding me?
I go.
well.
so I answered her.
I go.
she wrote me an e-mail.
I mean she called me up.
and I'm gonna call her later.
and Mary goes.
well this is what it's about.
this is what it's about.
and I'm like.
ok well I guess you know I'll talk to her and see.
but yesterday when she was leaving Mary's house she goes.
she's so funny.
she tells me.
I go.
what did you think?
she goes.
oh it's nice and this and this and the energy.
she goes.
but I don't know.
the Jewish thing that's funny.
she goes.
I don't know.
do you think it has anything to do with the Jewish?
you know I've had really bad experiences with Jewish people.
I don't want anything that belongs to them.
I go.
Caroline you need to break that.
not all Jewish people are bad.
I heard I heard when you said that.
but the thing is did you feel anything negative while you were there?
right she was happy.
no.
no.
she was happy.
she was you know
so then why would you.
because if you feel something all of a sudden
right if you feel bad.
because usually you feel bad you know.
exactly.
that was funny.
like that time that you had that coughing fit.
right.
que I had to get up and go.
you know.
and then but she went to check it out which's smart in her part.
that she found I don't know what she found.
but I I guess I'll find out tonight.
esto did you get the invitation?
and I guess from
you know I don't think so.
I need to ask David because he's the one that got the mail today.
aw because yours should have come in.
and then I'm gonna call for Trevor tomorrow to see that
well what I had done is I had emailed myself the thing saying that June six though the eight like that we have which is what I had emailed Kelly
right.
but remember I had emailed her the one that
from San Francisco.
from San Francisco.
and I said.
it's the same except you know put.
right.
entonces what I had done is gone ahead and printed it out.
and I go to Trevor.
this is what you'll be getting er a confirmation this way.
right.
but apparently he left it there like he went.
when I got to my desk today on my chair.
he had put the papers.
and what he did Friday.
you know the meeting he went to Friday?
uhuh.
which of course he slept probably through it.
and the other thing that he does is set certain colours.
you know how kids do?
yeah.
so everything was coloured.
doodle.
so when I find him I go.
I saw that you had fun.
I go.
and I also noticed you only had blue pen with you because you didn't do it in colours like you normally do.
so he was cracking up.
I go.
what do you want me to do with it?
he goes.
it's the same shit as always.
go ahead.
and just file it you know.
yeah.
I said.
ok.
entonces um so um he I had noticed when I got there in the morning that he had that he had left it there.
that he had taken it.
so I went ahead.
but you don't know they received it.
no.
he didn't say so I guess not.
entonces but when he left today since I went over there afterwards because then he told me Albert had been there to drop off stuff.
yeah.
I looked.
and he had taken it.
aw.
so I guess you know.
oh and I asked him.
yeah and I've.
I said.
I said.
are you going with are you are you gonna go by yourself on Friday?
or do you want us to pick you up?
and he goes.
no it's ok.
I'll go by myself.
I said.
yeah you don't want a car full of women huh?
and he goes.
no.
I go.
you have enough with ladies?
he goes.
yes.
I said.
ok.
y
hi!
y cómo se llama Kelly va con nosotros?
Kelly said she'll go on her own because she doesn't know she's gonna be there exactly at seven or eight.
yeah.
but maybe she'll do like Julia and go after making sure that everything is ok at school.
the
oh ok.
but they've got to remember that they are not gonna be let in until after the break.
ok.
no I'll remind her.
and they have to be there porque si no ya después
no no I'll remind her.
but she was like.
no I don't think so.
because I said.
are we picking you up?
and she was.
no no no I'll go on my own.
I know how to get there.
I'll go on my own.
and then then you know.
cause I guess I guess she's like Lidia.
just make sure that everything's ok at school and then go.
oh yeah they start early anyways probably.
yeah if they start the way they're supposed to it's at seven thirty.
yeah they leave what ten thirty.
but now you know you don't have to
the keys.
yeah they turn in the keys.
but you don't have to grade the bubble sheets anymore.
oh really?
like it's all electronic.
oh electronic.
oh that's cool.
right so that's why nowadays if you've get a check off sheet it's like
yeah seven thirty or so?
ah we don't have to grade bubble sheets which was the important stuff.
yeah which was everything that I was always behind.
yeah now the problem will be that if some of these people aren't like for her right now she should already be inputting the grades and uploading them.
because if they start waiting you know what?
computers are gonna be stuck and slow and all that stuff which is what happens in the other quarters.
oh really?
yeah.
so I had um another Albert called me.
and I got some of his papers.
and he goes.
no I'm putting the other one.
he goes.
what date are we supposed to print out our class list for you?
and I said.
well it's always supposed to be the last day of the quarter!
but that would be the fifth.
mmhm.
and then he goes.
yeah but
I go.
yeah but I'm sure you have mostly seniors so you know what?
just do.
and I doubt it that you're gonna be having any kids with drop today.
so you might as well print it out today.
he goes.
ok ok.
y Trevor's gonna be there early?
I think so.
oh ok.
no because what you can do then is like what we did with Caroline.
well I'll ask him I'll ask him.
yeah.
a menos que vaya él a buscar a Julia a lo mejor.
because.
yeah para no tener que ir en dos carros.
right.
maybe that's what needs done I don't know.
unless like the kids are home.
but they can call you.
like that's what I did with Caroline like I went with Rachel and um.
we're doing a study.
like I went with Rachel
then what we did is that when we got there I called you know with the cell phone.
yeah.
everybody was like.
hey where are you?
we're over here you know whatever you know.
right.
oh and is she gonna go now?
Caroline?
sí porque si ella estaba oy oyendo cuando Mary vino.
y dijo.
te dijo que Amy was gonna be a volunteer?
a volunteer.
or something like that?
she goes.
what?
and then Mia said she had been.
oh the millionaire that's right.
you guys have that coming up.
and Caroline started looking around like.
de qué hablan de qué hablan?
and then Mia goes.
oh have you been?
and she goes.
yeah I went last year.
are you going this time?
she goes.
oh I didn't know anything.
I didn't get anything.
who?
Caroline?
Caroline.
I thought she knew because we talked about it.
quién?
don't remember porque ella es despistada so.
Emily said she's hilarious.
en entonces um Mia said.
I went last year.
but now I have other things.
I'm not going this year.
and then that's when I guess Mary said is going.
and then she goes.
oh is Maria going?
I could always go with one of her tickets.
that's what she said.
eh.
and I was like.
thinking to myself.
I thought that won't work.
one of them was mine.
but ok.
actually I put Mary with me.
ok.
and then Trevor and and Julia are together.
Trevor and Julia.
but if she needs me to sign her up I'll sign her up.
yeah.
I don't know.
she told me.
and I go.
tonight.
fill out the thing.
right.
Caroline you don't know that.
just fill it out.
and you know what.
even if you don't get your tickets in time your name is already there.
exactly.
that's the most important thing.
yeah because the ticket I think is just a.
yeah eso no pasar el tiempo.
es un un foreshow.
yeah.
it doesn't have a.
it doesn't have your name on it or anything.
exactly.
it's just
you know.
they do have.
registered people would take it over here.
and they do have this.
and then they have the others that
you know.
you know.
pero
sí ella es un poco
I was noticing that.
when?
during the thing when Mia was going around asking what did you feel what did you see.
she was happy though.
I know but.
and she looked.
you know.
but she was looking around a ver lo que decían las otras.
creo que que.
no but she went before me.
oh yeah was a yeah.
right.
but she's the one that started it.
so it went around that way.
because she jumped.
and said.
you know.
I felt this oh my god.
I remember buying.
you know.
and it was all good.
I know exactly so
if you are feeling all good why all of a sudden do you wanna
yeah.
did you like it?
and she goes.
no it was good.
it was interesting.
and she goes.
it's totally different from Maria Jose.
and then I go.
yeah because it's it's a lot higher level and
you know.
she goes.
but you know what's weird.
and I go.
what?
I go.
what did you feel?
she goes.
oh my god.
she goes.
you know like when your heart is racing and whatever.
she goes.
like a.
she goes not racing but like.
oh you got butterflies in your stomach.
I felt them.
but it was butterflies like up in my
and I go.
did it go away?
she goes.
after a while at first it was still there.
entonces she's like when they did the healings she goes.
oh it's weird.
you know when they were saying the people's name or whatever she goes.
había una que from the lady that had two cases.
I go.
yeah.
mmhm.
she goes.
había una que when they said the name and everything.
she goes.
I had such a bad feeling.
like she's not gonna get better.
well that's the one that maybe she said she had no hope.
she had lost all the hope.
right.
that no that she yeah she lost hope and she and she um
they've taken her life force.
did you hear when Pia said they took her life worse?
yeah.
when they take your life force that's it.
you don't have no more life.
right.
your life force is sucked.
yeah.
so it takes a lot to put it back into you.
I was gonna say yesterday for this young man.
but I really didn't know his name.
which one?
Martha's.
oh.
stepson.
but I don't really know his name.
I know she calls him Dani.
so I think his name is Daniel.
oh.
but I wasn't
yeah.
totally sure.
you know.
and I was like
yeah.
do I?
or don't I?
you know.
but we can do it.
you have the powers.
yeah.
that's right.
the healing.
this is something that he doing for linguistics.
that means how do we speak.
but it's for and I because and I are the ones that switch languages.
you don't.
yeah.
so.
pero no um
no yesterday was fine.
I was doing
I started coughing which I I I was
but there was something going around because I felt it.
I felt like.
but I was.
there was one part.
oh my god I'm holding on to it.
that's why after I went to the bathroom.
I was trying.
I hold on to it.
and then I I said.
ok bring them.
bring the healing thing.
but I will feel it.
and I was like.
very
pero no.
doesn't Maria Jose say que happened.
it's because you are trying to stop it or block it.
I don't know.
in one of the books we've read?
doesn't it say that?
like when someone's saying something?
and you start coughing?
or that's what Pam.
you know.
one of those things that she says that you
yeah.
like when people when they're saying something.
and and
you don't wanna answer.
and you're like.
right you don't wanna face up.
or you're lying or whatever.
you.
oh yeah I've heard that.
so I was like.
it's not like you are lying.
and she's talking.
and I start coughing.
and I'm like.
why am I coughing?
there's nothing.
you know.
I know there must have been something going around.
you know so I'm like
I think there was
you know.
and Patty was funny.
she was watching the birds.
they were they were flying in and out and
mmhm.
Patty has a really good um
ella es linda.
lindo yeah.
tiene algo linda.
no y tiene ahora.
sí.
ella tiene.
she's bright.
she's very bright.
mmhm.
you know.
very happy all the time.
like you know.
her students should take after her porque la la esa.
she's taking a class Mary.
yeah I heard you say that.
I heard you told mum.
see.
it was funny when Mary said.
Patty is coming.
I mean I know that Patty was the other one.
but then she said Chetan.
Chetan is normally
for us it's usually a guy's name.
really?
at least all the Chetans I've even known have been guys.
oh really?
yeah.
so when she said Chetan.
and I told mom.
I was thinking of the one that we went to her house.
so I thought it was the the lady who had been to her house.
go to mom's.
sí sí es u es la es una pareja.
and then when they show up in their both.
the at the last thing that we went to.
remember that we had the gelatos.
that's right.
but like we don't really.
no that's Sally.
right but I don't really remember her name.
so I go to mom.
yeah.
es una pareja.
and then they show up.
and they're two women.
and I'm like thinking.
I hope mom doesn't think they're una pareja you know.
I don't think Sally would like that very much.
no exactly.
and the other lady's married so
so is Samy.
and Samy was saying something about her husband.
uhuh oh really?
yeah because she comes into.
when Johnny was as rude as he was.
oh my god.
she was throwing away.
I haven't spoken to Linda.
but you know what?
that was out of control.
when she was started throwing away some of the stuff she goes.
do you recycle?
and them um said yes.
my husband says.
you should be happy I recycle as much as I do.
oh I'll be happy when you recycle everything.
so that's the way I figured she's married.
oh ok.
to a man not
yeah to
so
but she's she's really cute.
ella tiene algo.
she's very bright.
yeah.
very bright.
no y tiene algo con los animales también.
que?
yeah.
pues viste.
enseguida she wanted to cut to clip the wings off Joseph.
yeah.
yeah very
Pia es la que cambia
like and you know what I.
you didn't see it, did you?
no.
oh my god.
mom told me!
were you were you here when mom was telling me?
well I I watched her because we had our eyes closed.
yeah the whole time I was
pero.
you know when we opened her eyes.
and then she would say.
oh do this now.
or she would all of a sudden start.
right.
me she would get these lines right here.
and she her mouth would like twist.
really?
and then that's when she would start.
and I was like.
ahora está de vieja.
o viejo.
you know one of the two.
yeah one of the one of the
and it's like mad.
and then you could
like she was struggling to get the words out in English.
right.
or something like that.
yeah.
you know?
so it was like wow.
your mom told me she she had four different faces.
I was like.
really I never seen her.
yeah.
because I don't pay attention.
I go into my thing.
and even her hands kind of twisted a little.
I was like wow.
really?
yeah.
I'm going to my things.
and you know I don't
sí pero Caroline wants to.
which is funny because to be like you like you say she's as enlightened as she is.
she's enlightened.
she's got her thing.
she you know.
right but you think she'd be more open.
pero en seguida she wants to
maybe she's more like Marta.
because she wants to then figure out why is it that they're like that.
why do they have this.
because enseguida.
what language were you chatting in?
yeah.
you know and what.
just let her chat.
yeah well because she she chanced also.
yeah I know but
at the meditation thing.
yeah I know but still
you know that that Mary and I were laughing because she has this thing about.
I don't want religion.
nothing to do with religion.
and blah blah blah.
but I was telling Mary.
yeah but they do it worse.
we went to the meditation.
and she goes.
she forgot I went.
and she goes.
oh Maria went with me to the meditation.
she goes.
she totally forgot I went.
and I go.
yeah.
and it's cute and everything.
and I go.
but they actually idolize a living person.
come on.
yeah oh really?
oh you didn't go to the meditation centre with us?
no.
oh my God Sam.
it's beautiful.
let me tell you.
the the meditation thing is is just gorgeous.
but it's a lady that I heard about when they read they read things.
and um I read it in a magazine in New York.
people actually go see this lady.
and they bow down to her and everything.
she's like a god.
and in this place they have candles and pictures of her.
and the people light candles to this lady.
I was like.
there's something wrong with this picture.
oh no that's weird.
yeah that's weird.
I would never like do that.
hi baby.
doing good?
that's good.
so I was like.
they are doing worse.
you don't
yeah that's not
how do you how can you do that?
you know.
but I heard that the lady is like really like um not like Gandh.
but you know.
yeah.
so people from
él dice que New York.
when the lady goes to New York the lines are out the door.
unbelievable.
maybe she thinks she's the pope.
she thinks she's the pope?
well the pope for for that.
for that part of
that sect religious sect or whatever.
maybe.
because when you don't
even if you think it's not a religion it it that's like a a cult.
yeah that's a cult.
yeah that's a cult.
to me that's a cult.
I felt like
like the Hare Krishnas.
I mean the meditations were good.
you know like the Hare Krishnas.
yeah but that was like a cult.
the place is really nice.
they are very quiet.
it's beautiful.
you take off your shoes.
it's all red carpet.
it's beautiful.
but cuando yo entré.
y yo vi todas esas fotos de esa mujer.
of her?
oh yeah no that's not good.
la la foto de la mujer.
entonces they put flowers?
oh no that's not good.
and they put candles.
and I'm like.
what is this?
and then I ask her then.
is she dead?
I mean.
and then at the end I go.
who is that?
you know.
I'll tell you when they were having the food is awesome.
it's all organic.
you know like whatever.
like raw and stuff.
yeah yeah.
awesome food.
and it's not expensive.
so I was like.
who is that?
and then she tells me.
oh that's.
and I go.
oh I read about her.
and one of the things.
but I was like.
why do you light candles to
no because she's like our
not that she's anything.
but she's like the head of the thing.
y no sé qué.
and I was like.
mm that's wrong.
yeah.
I mean.
I'm sorry.
but you know.
yeah no that's not
she's still living.
why are you lighting?
you know.
exactly why are you lighting a candle?
I mean we light candles.
because I like candles.
and I pray for everybody but
right but not in front of the picture.
no no that's not
well that's not a good thing to put
that's that is it's like you are idolizing.
you are idolizing.
yeah you are not supposed to idolize anything.
that's one of the first things god says.
I'm before everything.
and when you put a when you put a picture especially living person.
you know.
because we do or will say some people do put light light candles for for someone who has just passed away to give them light.
right the Mexicans do.
right.
no and the Mexicans in that thing they they honour on death day or something.
yeah the day after.
no the day of after Hallo after Halloween.
yeah they put the
yeah they put the candles.
and they put the things for them.
and they do.
you know.
to bring them back.
and they put everything that belonged to the person.
and they put it on the thing so
it's cool.
person.
and you are good to.
how do I know if it is doubled?
you can see it in the thing.
oh I don't know if it's doubled.
I don't see nothing.
because you are blind.
yeah so.
ciega.
y qué?
and then um
yeah but I'm sure you are still gonna do the hair thing.
yeah but I'm gonna look like a retard.
why?
is it cute?
if anything you look the cutest.
ah you are gay.

so the goat escaped through a a bigger hole in my in my fence right.
and mind you my grandfather used to walk that goat every morning around the neighborhood like like if it was like if it was a a dog.
ah.
so our next door neighbor had a dog right.
and whenever the the neighbor would let the dog out.
and he was like putting his work stuff away.
and then so in when the dog.
he closed the door.
and he left for work.
he didn't see the goat go in.
so my grandfather wakes up like at ten.
and he is looking for the goat frantic.
and he's screaming around the neighborhood.
Tete Tete where are you?
like that like frantic.
so somehow some way he looks inside of the neighbor's house.
uhuh.
and there's the goat with the dog running around eating all the furniture pooping everywhere.
that's crazy.
we had to call our neighbors.
we had to help them clean everything.
we had to help them do all the furniture.
it was just oh god.
Tete.
Tete where are you?
ay.
so do you have a funny story?
you have super good stories.
and I love how you tell them.
oh yeah yeah.
my family's just crazy.
do anything crazy.
oh my mom has a patch on her eye.
why?
I told you.
she's got shit corneas.
she used to have contacts.
mind you the contacts are.
uhuh oh I did that.
I did that.
the contacts are purely for show.
hah.
like for color.
she had colored contacts on.
I mean she doesn't have perfect vision.
but they they have no prescription on it.
uhuh.
and so she she scratched her cornea really bad to the point that they had to do surgery.
this was like ten years ago.
so whatever she had like stitches and all that stuff.
and apparently my mom's my mom my mom has really bad allergies.
and she loves to like scratch her eye.
you understand what I mean?
uhuh.
so she um she actually ended up scratching opening up stitches that she had from super long time ago that I guess never healed right.
scratching it.
oh that's crazy.
so now you have to look at her.
she looks like a pirate.
she has a patch.
on one eye.
you know what I mean.
and like she's walking around.
and she wants you to like feel bad for her.
because she's like.
I don't feel good.
but I was like tell her.
um like yesterday.
how how are your brothers?
that's what I was about to tell you.
Almí's a Almí's a snitch.
yesterday he he wanted to use my computer.
but like I get really moody.
like when I get home and like I'm tired.
and like all I wanna do is be on my computer.
like whether I'm playing Snood or on Facebook or like googling random stuff.
uhuh.
so.
Snood.
so he comes in.
and he's like.
they love to like use my computer.
mind you we have another computer in the house.
but my computer is the only one that's hooked up to a printer.
so he's like.
oh I gotta print something out.
he doesn't have to print out anything.
he wants to go check Sports net like
yeah.
you know what I mean?
like it's a fantasy football.
and so whatever I locked the door so that he can't come in my room.
because he loves to come in there.
and then he he's like snitching on me.
he's like.
mom she won't let me use the computer.
and I have to do something for school.
so there comes my mom with her patch on her eye.
feel bad for them oh oh pobrecito.
they love your brothers?
who my mom?
yeah.
no my mom kind of forgets they exist.
they're always at my grandma's house.
yeah they don't live with us so.
why?
yeah they're always at abuela's house.
?
yeah.
like they don't really like my house.
so who lives at your house?
you your mom and Larry?
no!
me my mom Larry which is my step dad Larry's brother who came from Cuba with his girlfriend who.
his mistress who she's had for thirteen years.
yeah.
is this the story you told to miss Smith?
no this is a true story.
this isn't even.
this is like new people.
this is like new people that I didn't even know existed.
this is one of like Larry's.
remember I told you Larry has like five brothers.
uhuh.
this is one of his five brothers.
with his mistress.
with his mistress.
he left his wife and his two kids in Cuba.
and they're both living at my house.
and then on top of everything Larry's dad is living at my house.
because he just got separated from his girlfriend.
here in Cuba like here here in Miami who who when he came from Cuba he started hanging out with this lady.
then her son came from Cuba.
and then he's the one who's forming problems between Larry's and the girlfriend.
so Larry's dad got fed up and moved out.
but now he's not even home half the time.
because he's still with her.
but now they're in a dating stage.
ah.
you know what I mean?
they have they're they're in a dating.
they're getting to know each other.
they're getting to know each other.
and then that's how it is.
it's ridiculous.
so your house is crazy.
oh my house is.
how many bedrooms do you have?
I have three.
which is my mom's that was split down the middle because it used to be two.
mine.
and then like the garage which is like a big room.
but they like they remade everything.
oh yeah no no no.
my brothers don't sleep in the same room because they can't stand each other breathing.
mmhm.
they both breathe too loud.
that's what they say.
they breathe too loud.
so we have one brother who sleeps in there.
oh and they don't even have furniture.
because since we redid that entire room we were gonna redo furniture.
like give them furniture.
but then now they decided to put back up the wall in my mom's room so one of them can have that one.
and the other one can have the other one.
and the other one can have the other one.
and then I have another room that Larry has like his work stuff in there.
and then
like whatever.
so we didn't never get them finished thinking that we were gonna put up a wall.
but we never put up the wall.
so now Oliver sleeps on a mattress in the in the garage.
sleeps on a mattress in my mom's room with my mom and Larry.
Ana and Lexi sleep on another mattress in in like where the T V room.
and Paco which is Larry's dad sleeps on a.
on a cot.
on a cot outside like in the sala.
outside?
not outside.
like outside in like the formal sala you know that like it's only for show.
like you're not allowed to sit in it.
you know what I'm talking about.
yeah.
it's like furniture that like it's like fifty years old.
nobody can sit on it.
can I ask you something?
in your oven.
this is super random.
, do you do you keep pots in your oven?
yes!
full of like oil.
that's super Cuban.
full of aceite.
everyone I've asked today no one does that.
oh my god my mom loves.
that is super Cuban.
my mom fries stuff and then she puts it in the oven.
like she doesn't let the.
that's very Cuban.
she doesn't even let the the the the oil like
to cool cool.
cool.
she just puts it in the oven.
that's very Cuban.
like for me to bake a cake I have to take out like twenty pots.
no and.
my my the top of my horno's like like topped like stacked.
I'm like.
mom this is.
no but not only that you also have pans in like the the pans like what you cook on in there.
yeah.

so you have to take out like twenty things.
yes.
ok.
and then finally get the one you want.
everyone's like.
no.
that's a very Cuban thing.
and then after you have to wait for everything to cool or if you're gonna be able to put everything back in again.
yes.
so you have that.
I have that.
and at my grandma's house too.
a lot of people don't do that.
it's very Cuban.
it's very Cuban.
no that's like do you cook with Mazola?

or that yellow powder that you put in like um
my family puts it on everything on like chicken soup everything.

that's funny.
and how's everything with your mom?
she's good.
how's your mom?

oh.
how come he didn't go to like Columbus?
he went for a year.
but then he didn't want to.
he didn't like?
and then when we started going to to this church like all his friends went to Westwood.
so then he wanted to go to Westwood.
you go to church?
every Sunday?
mmhm.
and Wednesdays and Fridays.
exactly like that.
ahah.
um have you been back to Lourdes?
no.
I went once.
we went once.
and we were running amuck.
we even went to um Walgreens.
and got like masks.
and it was right around Hallowe'en so we were like running around like scaring the crap out of people.
I was in a Blues brothers mask.
ay you guys.
I was looking at the pictures the other day of when you guys were like you and and Vanessa the big Cuban like ladies with the big buds.
and the thing.
oh.
oh my god.
the sumo wrestlers.
those guys are always above and beyond.
did you see Darla's pictures?
it's like intense sumo wrestling.
it's like it's like a full harness.
like they even have the little hat with the bun.
I don't know.
like no it's like a game.
like you go somewhere.
and you hit each other.
I don't know.

look at it.
look at her um
Darla who?

oh my god that girl's so funny.
no she.
ok.
look.
I have called her the last month for real like six times.
and you know how like when people like ignore your call you know?
it rings the whole time so I know she gets it.
so then I don't like when people play like dumb with me.
ok?
and I'm like kind of bitter about this.
then I know I shouldn't be.
but whatever.
kind of bitter about it.
she I med me.
and she's like.
oh are you alive?
I'm like.
Darla
like I'm like.
no.
be like look I'm sorry.
you know.
I had a lot of stuff to do.
but don't be like where are you.
you're lost.
like if like if
I hate that.
I hate that.
so then so then I was like I was like about to go off on her.
and I was like.
like I've called you six times.
but I have to go.
goodnight.
and then I got off.
no don't play stupid with me.
no.
I hate that.
what is that.
I hate that.
I hate that.
where are you?
you're lost.
I'm like.
great.
um
I hate that.
I know I know you don't like talking about it.
but you know who I always talk to now?
Sara.
crazy.
like obviously she's like number one.
like like super excited.
more like super against each other.
and she's coming this weekend.
she um called me up.
not called me up.
she messaged me.
she's like.
hey whatever I wanna come down.
I wanna see you.
she wants to she wants me to go um to like Amanda Harding's house.
mind you I don't even think Amanda Harding likes her.
yeah I think she hates us.
but no I think that she hates us by association.
but I'm sure Sara's told her like.
oh no like whatever.
yeah she's the one that was with.
yeah.
but you know who's really nice?
Ana.
dud but I just saw.
and her sister Anita.
I just got an email cause I'm I'm like logged into this class.
um you have to log into the Herald.
who Sara?
Sara's mom.
oh yeah.
what is that?
over Robert she lost her job.
she has three kids.
she has four.
but Sara
she is.
she is.
yeah but she lost her duties.
that's crazy.
over Robert.
wait but didn't she get a new job?
she supposedly.
I guess when her and Robert were like back together again.
her mom um
I know she got a new job.
her mom.
she got reassigned somewhere.
Robert supposedly like choked her.
oh yeah.
so she pulled out a gun.
what is she doing?
Robert hello.
no it's not even.
it's that Robert lost his.
it's that all these people are like insane.
and I hate finding out about them.
and I always like.
I'm like.
do you talk to her still?
she called me once before she left.
oh yeah?
did you hear about the eye story?
yeah?
Sara called me once before she left.
I don't hate talking about it.
um but
we're just not friends.
here's the thing.
I at the end of the day I think she has a she has some of a heart.
ok because she's done a lot of messed up things like the whole thing with Brenda Paltro.
that she.
yeah but how how is Brenda even talking to her?
yeah that's what I'm saying.
Sara realized that she had messed up the next day.
because she was belligerent.
so she realized that she had messed up the next day.
called her up.
and said like.
sorry look.
you know what I mean?
I was messed up.
whatever I said things I didn't mean or whatever.
and once you talk about it it's ok.
like the whole thing with Katrina.
yeah but I don't like Sara wanted to come to my house.
did you hear what she said about Katrina?
did she?
wait.
did you hear what she said to Katrina?
no.
ok Katrina poked her on Facebook.
which was immature.
that's not her business.
why'd she poke her?
because she's stupid.
just because you know to.
to mess around?
yeah to mess around.
it's childish.
whatever.
and um Sara wrote her back this nasty message.
like destroyed her life.
no yeah.
this really.
you know Sara.
ok when you mess with Sara she goes after you your family anybody you've ever been with.
yeah but she's crazy.
and like anybody.
so you know what she told her?
the kids you don't have.
she told her.
she's like flat out.
she's like.
look.
she's like.
I don't care to be your friend.
I don't know why you know what I mean you consider you know what I mean you try messing with me.
and when I talked to her after she told me that a lot of it had to do with the reason why she was so angry is because when you guys were in a fight Katrina got involved.
did she ever get involved?
I don't remember.
something that Katrina got involved with you with like a situation between you guys.
and then you know what she writes at the end of the message?
she goes.
I hope that your father is looking down on you.
Sara?
like because her dad's dead.
and yeah.
and then like whatever.
like everybody was outraged that she had said such a thing.
.
I didn't know Katrina's dad died.
when did he die?
oh like a long time ago.
when we were younger.
but Katrina's mom remarried no?
no.
I don't think so.
I don't know Katrina's life.
oh my god I don't know it.
and then um.
I didn't know Katrina's dad died.
and then she talked about that.
so all this stuff.
and then everybody was like.
oh what is that?
she has no heart.
all this stuff.
and like when I talked to Sara about it.
because I talk to Sara about everything flat out like the vacuum cleaner story in the apartment the turning on and off of the chime the comment about lesbians.
ay but she's frikking crazy.
like all that stuff I talk to her about.
and she she was telling me that the whole thing with Katrina is she felt bad after having said something.
but she knew that if she hadn't said something so powerful Katrina would have probably written back to that comment.
and then it woulda just started this whole thing.
she's like.
I wanted to say something to her that she knew I meant business.
and that I want nothing to do with her.
you understand what I mean?
ok.
look.
I need to say something.
so you know what that reminds me of?
like the like Elena thing.
when they were like.
I don't think we should be friends.
I think we I think we should take a break.
like how old are we?
we're super we're super immature.
ok like like that whole thing of like.
oh I needed to tell her her dead father.
oh bro.
like what is that?
yo bro.
she's she's
ay pobre I think she's very like like.
but like she's like result of her like like family.
she is.
I think for real for real I think Sara has like like issues.
because dude I remember like when she was like living with me oh my god the nights that she would cheat on Paul.
and then call him crying.
and this whole thing.
she wanted to go see.
oh you know how many times she's cheated on?
but but ok.
but how?
like where in someone's right mind
but she.
I don't know.
but see like.
but what is that dude?
but what is that?
like today she was texting.
again.
like does she like asking for forgiveness twenty six times like a month?
and like I don't get.
I don't get why you like feel like like you're caught.
her leaving to Tallahassee was like a big deal.
it caused like a lot more problems than she.
oh no here's the thing.
when I found out ok.
and where's she going after her T c c dude?
ok to F s u.
yeah right.
she's getting in?
when I found out that she had left to Tallahassee without telling her mom anything and all this stuff.
that's crazy.
and it had just happened that thing with my mom.
so when I went to Tallahassee I look at her.
and I'm like.
Sara you can't do that.
because at the end of the day that's your mom.
and I guess like something clicked in her head.
you know what I mean?
that's the thing.
that's the reason why me and Sara.
Ana's always like.
I don't understand how you're friends with her.
all this stuff.
the girl's shady.
she's done a whole bunch of shady things.
yeah but the one person that I can talk to.
like obviously I have Veronica.
and I have Vanessa and stuff.
but like Ana and them they judge me all the time.
you know what I mean?
maybe not to my face.
but they do.
and Vanessa I think to an extent judge me too.
because we're different.
you know what I mean?
mmhm.
but me and Veronica are very similar.
you know what I mean?
yeah hers is just her dad.
and mines is my mom.
so what happens is that Sara's that type of person that I can go to Sara.
and I can tell her anything.
you know what I mean?
and I know she's not gonna judge me.
why?
because she's done pretty messed up things in her life.
and she's had a pretty messed up family too.
so it's not.
you know what I mean?
it's not like
she yeah she she's no one to judge me.
yeah yeah yeah.
and on top of everything when I tell her.
I can I can talk to Veronia as much as I can.
and try to tell her things about my mom.
but at the end of the day she has a mom who's great.
you know what I mean?
mmhm.
who's there for her.
and all that stuff.
so.
yeah.
with Veronica it's different.
because at the end of the day I have the dad.
and she doesn't have the dad.
do you understand what I mean?
but with Sara it's um it's the it's the same issue.
it's the moms.
although her mom maybe more crazy than mine.
you know what I mean?
to a certain extent.
because my mom's crazy.
more crazy in a certain point.
and her mom is more crazy.
it's different yeah yeah.
and another point
so that's why.
you know what I mean?
I talk to her.
so when I talked to her about that whole thing I think it kinda clicked in her head.
and her and her mom were good for a.
you know what I mean?
after the Tallahassee her mom even took her up.
they don't talk like her and her mom?
and stayed there.
I'm not I'm not sure how their relationship is right now.
when I go see her I think I'm gonna do it.
yeah.
oh after that whole thing with Robert.
and that he got arrested because of um violence with.
remember that day we called her?
with the new wife.
there was like a whole issue.
yeah yeah I know.
I got the email.
yeah.
it's crazy.
there was a whole issue or whatever.
and then I think I think that
from the Harold.
what do what do what do you mean you get?
like.
I'm I'm subscribed to the Harold online.
oh.
I have to in my classes for my for my technology class.
I know but.
so it sends me the paper online.
like instead of having the paper.
oh so you read it?
well it's like headlines.
I get all the articles.
all separate?
oh so your your your
it's all it's all it's like I get every section separate.
because I only signed up for the ones I wanted.
and then one of them had to do like business.
and whatever.
I don't even know which one they're under.
but yeah I got those.
yeah so
it's just retarded.
she called me when she left.
but I don't think she was like ok.
because well that day was like crazy.
and I was at my house.
and I had just gone on this retreat.
and I was showing her the video of like my group whatever.
and then she's like.
I didn't have.
she got a new number.
I didn't have it saved.
then she's like.
?
and I was like.
oh my god.
I'm like.
yeah.
she's like.
hey it's Sara.
I'm like.
hey Sara.
it was weird.
I hadn't said her name in like months.
and then um she's like of course super defensive.
she's like.
look if you can't talk to me it's fine.
I'm like.
like hey.
what's up?
you know?
then she's like.
look.
I just wanted to call.
she's like.
I just wanted to call to apologize.
and all this stuff.
we had a great friendship.
but I don't think it should have ended the way it did.
you remember everything she did right?
yeah.
ok.
she's like.
I don't think it should have ended the way it did.
it's just you know like I was mad at you.
and I was like
yeah you shoulda been the one mad at her.
what?
yeah.
she's like.
but you know like I don't know like.
I don't know.
I have a lot of your stuff.
oh that's another thing.
she had a lot of my stuff.
right?
so she told Janet that she was gonna throw them in the middle of the Lourdes parking lot.
which woulda been like beyond.
but Janet was like.
no don't do that.
give me some of it.
so Janet didn't want.
like she took my Betsey Johnson purse.
and she never gave it back.
wow.
whatever.
which it doesn't even matter.
because that's something materialistic.
but um
oh were you in my class the day she came to take a book from my class?
she's like.
give me my book.
oh I heard of that.
I heard that.
ok whatever.
that day I went upstairs.
and I shouldn't have done it.
now that I think about it.
I'm like.
bro I like lowered like under her level.
I was like.
I was like.
um I was like.
here's your book.
but you owe me the the Dartmouth trip.
and I was like.
well I even like regret that then.
oh I remember that.
now I should now that was like stupid of me.
that was huge controversy.
but so stupid.
whatever.
and then I told her like.
shut up.
and the whole thing.
and then that day that she called me she's like.
like I know you guys did a lot for me.
and you guys were really there for me like a bad time.
and I was like.
ok Sara.
then she's like.
look.
she's like.
I was thinking like maybe before I leave can we go to lunch?
I was like.
look.
um I was super nice after.
she called like six times.
because she thought that I was like kidding.
I'm like.
Sara look.
I'm like.
I really have nothing against you.
whatever I'm like.
I really hope everything's going good.
and that you have like a safe time in Tallahassee.
but like I don't like wanna go eat with you.

I was like.
I don't like really like wanna see you.
I'm like.

because bro I spent money on my Betsey Johnson.

I was like.
but then I realized like that's very materialistic.
and like it it shouldn't be like I need to see you because I need this whatever.
and I was like.
and on top of that like I doubt that my mother wants her like anywhere near my house.
anywhere near your house.

Sara's like kinda like really loose in the head.
sometimes it like upsets me like of how much like time like my family and stuff like spent.

crazy how like like all the things she was saying.
I'm like.
who you talking to?
who are you talking to?
is there anybody there?
no.
oh.
at the end like everything she would do and all the things she would say.
and like the malicia.
and the stuff she would tell like.
Julie's like half my brain ok.
like Julie is like I talk to her every day twice a day whatever.
I'm like.
what do you.
Sara's like.
what are you doing?
I'm like.
what you forgot.
like
all the times.
I don't know.
it's just weird.
it felt like very like.
it's like my it's like my sister says.
like bipolar.
I forgive.
but I never forget.
so you can forgive Sara.
but you never forget everything that happened.
yeah yeah yeah.
look look at this ring.
it turned my finger blue.
like it looks like my tattoo.
yeah.
but I like it so much.
but she told that.
when she called to apologize for hurting her.
she was like.
oh I'm just bitter because you chose Melanie's friendship over mine.
ok one Mel and I are like
was like.
oh ok Sara.
wait.
you know why we call.
she's like.
that's why you're.
and um that's like drama central.
you know you know why we call Bonnie Guite right?
it's making fun of you guys.
for real?
yes because you guys talk like little muffin like.
no it's Bonnie.
it's Bonnie.
and so then like we love to have you.
from from flavor of love yeah.
yeah so so whatever.
we always thought it was super funny how you guys called her Guite.
but her name has nothing to do with Guite.
so then Bonnie who really is Guite we just started calling her Guite.
and then like it stuck.
I mean at the beginning it was like to make fun.
but now just like I like it.
like I like her.
whenever she calls me I'm like.
Aaron.
I used to hate Guite.
Guite.
no no no you smell like
you smell like that pot I put in my oven.
I'm disgusting.
I can't wait to shower.
ay used to live in the corner.
en la esquina.
like Senior skit the other day.
we were watching Senior skit.
ay.
what
it's a very Cuban thing.
do you put pots in the oven?
yeah.
oh that's the worst.
the second you go to bake cookies you have to like unload.
yeah.
everything.
it's like twenty.
ay cuidado con el aceite.
and you're like
yeah like cuidado con el aceite.
Susana.
Susana.
we don't do crazy stuff like that.
but Sara's here for like good?
no no no no no.
ok Sara had told me that she didn't know if she was gonna stay in Tallahassee because her grandparents were paying for it.
but they couldn't pay for it.
because Sara doesn't have bright future.
she doesn't have.
she yeah first Robert was paying for it.
when Robert started paying for it he wasn't even paying for his kids.
that was crazy.
I think Robert did it out of spite.
for everything.
I think Robert did it out of spite.
and then.
bro Carry takes that to court Robert's broke.
she had to
she had told me that um
yeah but what here dude.
that her grandparents weren't gonna pay for it any more.
and she was gonna have to figure out what to do.
but from what I heard she's already planning to move in with all these people or whatever.
yeah yeah.
but.
why would she be planning a move if
you know what I mean?
but whose paying for the rent?
I don't know.
maybe maybe finally she
maybe she's not paying for it.
maybe she's.
maybe she doesn't have to pay for the rent.
maybe she doesn't have to pay.
or maybe maybe she's she's maybe her like Cathy.
Cathy like breeds out of her butt.
maybe what she told Cathy was.
oh I'll move in into your room.
you know what I mean?
and like we'll just share a room.
but you pay for the rent or whatever.
yeah either way she always stays with Derek.
yeah but whose paying for T c c?
I she she had originally said she was taking out loan.
but I don't believe she ever took out loan.
oh my god.
do you know what I mean?
first of all if if if you're taking out loans in your undergraduate.
if you're taking out loans in your undergraduate there's a problem.
you know what I mean?
because that that's
yeah but what what is she gonna be?
if you're if you're gonna be a doctor I'd be like whatever bro.
oh!
no.
take them all out.
now she says.
you're paying them all back.
now she says she wants to be now she says she wants to be a cop.
because we were talking when me and her we started talking about the whole and the whole controversy and the rooms and all that stuff
do do do her friends like?
do her friends what?
no no.
no that's just
that's like the biggest thing I heard.
here's the thing.
when that when that was issued when that was given to them like that nickname by Lucy was given to them then they took it to a whole nother level.
here's the thing.
if you get called something and you know it's not true and you think it's so funny that that person even thought about it.
you drop it.
uh you know hello.
I don't drop it.
remember what she called me?
that was crazy.
I don't drop it.
oh I don't know about that.
there's like there's I don't think I don't think that story's like that wrong.
according to her no.
I don't think that maybe she did it.
but I think I think there's something behind that.
I don't know.
dude you can't get that out of nowhere.
I don't know.
I mean whether Lucy said it.
Lucy said it because.
I mean there was something there.
like that they kissed or whatever whatever.
yeah but their pictures are gross.
have you seen the pictures?
that's what I'm telling you.
the pictures now attribute to the fact that Lucy said what she said.
they're just taking the joke to a whole another level.
that's what happened with the whole dyke thing.
mmhm I dunno.
and.
but I would almost drop it.
that's what I kept telling Sara.
I'm like.
just drop it already.
she's like.
oh she's.
yeah that's what I kept telling her.
but whatever.
oh well the whole cop thing.
she was telling me that.
and you know that Sara's very.
she was telling me that she feels like breaking face in.
you know what I mean?
but the reason why she doesn't do it is cause she already has a a a violence on her record.
that's one.
oh my god.
and two.
who is she?
yeah that she already has violence on her record.
and two she doesn't want that you know what I mean any more because the violence from before was from what we were sophomores.
so that's like expunged the minute you you turn eighteen.
you know what I mean?
it's expunged?
yeah it's expunged.
so whatever.
you know what I mean?
and like now she says that she wants to go in to like the police force and whatever.
and she wants to do it.
to police force.
I think I think you have to you have to
and don't you have to start off like an explorer or something crazy like that?
you have to you have to major in like I think maybe that maybe maybe like you should major in like law studies.
or something like that.
or like criminal justice.
yeah but isn't T c c only two years?
and then later on you become.
T c c is two years.
it's a community college.
I mean you could be in a community college for four years.
but it's your first sixty credits.
you don't need college.
yeah but where where is she going?
yeah.
but where is she going?
she goes right now to T c c if she even goes to school.
I don't really know Sara's academic career.
yeah but I'm saying where is she going after?
she's not does she have grades F s u?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'll talk to her about it.
see what she wants to do or whatever.
well she coulda done so good here.
the coach was like Sara.
oh she coulda been an an excellent runner.
they would have paid for everything.
they coulda had a full
you don't get it.
right.
but.
she just said it.
all she needed was ten more points.
ten more points on her S a ts.
you know what that is?
it's like dot your I on your name.
give me a break.
it's like cross your fingers.
you'll get it.
you know?
ten points dude.
ten points.
yeah but usually like they help you.
if like your scores are low they still help you get in.
but hers weren't like like she needed to improve them.
like there wasn't anything the coach could do whatever.
but he told her.
he's like.
improve them.
I can give you dorm.
I can give you.
you know because if if she filed
I told her.
you know how many times I told her about?
and at this time her grandparents had custody of her.
which means she woulda had to have put her grandparents' information.
they're two retired people.
ok?
that get paid off of like Medicare or whatever.
you know what I mean?
social security.
that's crazy.
so you know how much money she woulda gotten?
her grandparents must make like what twenty thousand?
bro she threw that all away.
but you know what?
she threw everything away.
when we stopped being friends that's when she left to T c c.
but I I told her
for real.
when we stopped being friends she was coming with me.
I took her to all the all the coaches that that like every time the coach wanted to eat with her she didn't want him to know that she didn't have a car.
would take her.
you know?
whatever.
I took her to seriously like ten dinners.
maybe like four.
I took her to whatever.
the coach was like super on her.
he called her every day.
all this stuff.
the second we stopped being friends she was like.
oh she thought everything was like this.
Cathy got into F s u because of me.
ok?
but doesn't Cathy go there for free?
because
yeah.
listen.
she got she got in for free because of me.
because you told her right about the thing?
the care program.
ok?
because we were sitting in Art class.
Cathy Cathy had no thought of even going to Tallahassee.
ok?
and and I was talking to my who was great ok.
who she knew since the minute my sister left that school that that's where I wanted to go.
mmhm.
you know what I mean?
miss Thomas who was great.
she would call Esther everyday.
you know what I mean?
and then she told me.
look there's a loophole.
your grades aren't that well.
which mind you I brought up my grades senior year like ridiculous.
I graduated with a three point eight from Lourdes.
you know what I mean?
why?
because I was just lazy.
if I put my mind to it I can do it.
mmhm.
because I'm not stupid.
I'm lazy.
and so what happened was that she she had told me about the care system whatever and all this stuff.
and it was if your parents made under a certain amount of money.
um mine's happened because my mom was divorced.
whatever it was all the money issue.
and you know how like Cathy isn't that well off?
mmhm.
and like they have a business but like.
they have like flimsy jobs yeah yeah.
but like yeah.
but like it's like going down.
and whatever all this stuff.
like Lucy was always talking to us about how her parents were helping out with Cathy and all that stuff.
yeah yeah yeah.
and I told her about it.
and she's like.
oh ok I'm gonna go ask my counselor.
because her counselor didn't care.
you know what I mean?
like if if she didn't get in
yeah.
she and then so she went to her counselor.
she got that thing.
she wrote the great essay.
all this stuff.
she got in.
yeah but Cathy and Lucy haven't been friends for a long time.
the thing is is that when you have a friendship for such a long time Lucy was always the dominant one.
and Cathy was always the one that just followed along whatever Lucy said.
and so what happened was that that Lucy would kind of like not mistreat Cathy but she would kinda like take Cathy for granted.
you know what I mean?
and like tell her things.
and then and what happened was then Cathy became close to Esther who is more or less like her.
cause Esther is a very is a very is a person who follows.
she she you know what I mean?
you tell her what to do and she does it.
so they became friends.
and then when Lucy saw that Esther and Cathy were getting close together she.
well Lucy had her phases.
oh she had her phase.
I remember.
Lucy had the craziest moments.
oh yeah.
I remember.
do you remember when it was like.
I remember when there was like a point that it was like people are like scared of Lucy.
like no one wanted to talk to her.
she was that scary.
when we went on retreat.
because she was that.
when we went on retreat.
first of all she treated Mark like crap.
ok because I remember distinctly a game a game
is she better now?
yeah.
a game here.
I'll tell you right now story.
mmhm.
I remember a sto distinctly a game here at at um F i u Columbus versus something that she was screaming at Mark like if Mark was her kid.
screaming at him.
telling him all these things like
people thought she was crazy.
like all.
Lucy I mean Esther Bonnie and Tiffany were ready to drop that friendship.
ok?
so the point.
oh.
then we went then we went on encounter.
oh she was insane.
ok?
I went on encounter junior year in hopes of becoming a.
and senior year I could um like I could be one of the talks.
uhuh.
wait.
um you know this is a picture of the parking garage that you can easily tell.
uh there's G c up top P c on the left side book store on the top side as well.
I mean this is pretty readable right?
this isn't some kind of disgusting explanation.
this is a map of parking garage.
yeah I mean just you can orient them.
all right.
now the next one.
um the next one after that.
next one.
yeah all right.
I'm gonna ask you if you were standing there.
were you standing at point one?
yes I was standing at point one when the police found us so and so on.
during the incident ok uh when we were found were you standing at point one on the third floor?
that's where we were standing.
It's imperative that we make that clear because the next page.
so this so this is so this is G c right?
on the next page you'll see it.
on the next page you'll see it.
um it's imperative you say it because on the next page then he's got an option.
where were you standing you know right before you came up?
and I've got pictures for each and every one of those.
nice.
ok.
um except for location two.
I have location nine.
but if it's location two it'll be beautiful cause I'll be it will say the building.
what what did you see?
what did you hear?
did you hear it over there?
why didn't you check over there?
I mean
yeah.
then I think the last page I've got is the on the fifth floor.
we shoulda we we should ask ah we should ask this guy a question in Spanish.
cómo te sientes?
cómo te sientes?
we should ask them before and after.
yeah yeah we should switch.
we should we should say all the main questions in English all the nice questions in Spanish.
oficial policía.
how do you how do you say how do you how would you say like officer in Spanish?
señor.
I would have to say oficial right?
oficial.
oficial?
I mean that sounds
you wouldn't say policía cause that's that's
yeah oficial yeah oficial.
yeah.
because I mean like if it's a detective you just say like you know detective.
un detective sí.
oficial.
make it sound better.
uhuh.
because if you it sounds very uh
actually you don't want to tell someone you know in fascist Argentina.
you know like that's
or in fascist Chile.
oficial.
oficial.
yeah actually like uh.
you don't call your best friend oficial.
like that's
did you know where the term fascism comes from?
no.
like I was watching ah Rome with my dad.
mmhm.
that that mini series that was like well it was like it was like a like a show like a full length H b o show.
and um there was a there was a staff like a huge staff
right!
with ah the eagle.
ok.
which is like the it's like.
I forgot the the name for the the actual emblem.
but it's ah it's it's it's some some particular thing uh that signifies the legion.
you know that signifies the Caesar.
and it's called the.
the oh ok.
so so like that that staff is a symbol of state so fascism.
the statism yeah that's
yeah.
Caesar that's awesome.
so yeah.
yeah so like he told me about that.
I was like.
yeah it's pretty cool.
like I didn't I didn't know that.
um
yeah so
now I just have to start calling you fascist instead of a communist which is ridiculous and stuff.
it's like
boggle my mind.
there's no difference.
that's the thing.
like like like like if
yes there is.
as my as my friend always brings up it's like if you take like the the two polar extremes are curved you know.
mmhm.
so at the at the high point of the curve they are at opposite ends.
but as you get lower on the curve or higher on the curve they start to converge.
that's an interesting way to look at it.
because think about it you know.
fascist Italy and communist Soviet Union not that different you know.
but they fought.
so I mean
you know what I mean?
so what's the difference?
you know it's it's a it's a state governed
so it's the name of the brand man so.
yeah it's like it's like government.
yeah well it's not state it's government you know.
it's it's management.
I mean yeah it's whatever you know.
so
I shot an A k yesterday.
I was gonna ask you that.
I was gonna ask you about the about the gun.
what were you gonna ask me?
that was delicious.
that was amazing.
um I have a bruise on my shoulder right now from the rifle that I shot.
you ever seen the movie Enemy at the gates?
yes.
you know the rifle he has.
yes.
this super accurate gigantic man rifle he's got.
mmhm.
I shot that.
a man rifle yeah.
destroyed my shoulder.
nice.
um it literally felt like the second I pulled the trigger there was this small like gnome right at the hundred yard mark who ran over and then punched me in the shoulder and ran back behind the target.
nice nice.
um
red like from here to here.
nice.
it's beautiful.
Dave shot it one time.
and then he's got this black and blue bruise.
nice.
um.
what's that called the like the the
recoil.
recoil.
I was gonna say backlash.
yeah.
but it's essentially the same.
it's pretty much the same thing.
but when you're talking about guns it's recoil.
right.
after that I shot the A k like maybe a hundred times.
and that that was nothing.
compared to that first rifle that was nothing.
yeah.
you have to see you have to see Lord of war because Lord of war like the centre piece weapon in Lord of war is the A k the Kalashnikov you know.
yeah.
like he starts he goes into this monologue about like all the benefits of of a Kalashnikov.
and it's it's like it's the weapon.
and it's like the.
you know how they market.
I mean I'm sure you know this.
but do you know how they marketed the Kalashnikov?
no.
the first time around?
um the first time they marketed it they said I can clear a soccer field with four hundred men like that four hundred men with ten of mine.
give me ten Kalashnikovs and ten men and I will clear a football field with four hundred people.
Jesus.
how long?
they asked.
four seconds.
four seconds?
what do the other guys have?
well nothing.
they have rocks?
you have four seconds to throw a rock.
you know you never.
tirando piedras.
you know I realized yesterday why people don't use full auto um when they shoot.
and it's because I heard someone shoot an A k full auto thirty rounds.
it took about four seconds.
the entire magazine gone.
it was like one two three four done.
it was a whole magazine.
they've now wasted thirty rounds of ammunition.
it probably cost them twenty dollars in four seconds in four or five seconds.
yeah.
I mean if you have your target in place I mean you want to unleash.
do it.
go full auto you know but.
that's why they use three round burst.
um that's that's why they use three round.
and the three round burst is pretty fast.
it's.
but at least with three round you hit in the same place.
yeah.
I was shooting it shot by shot with the Kalashnikov at um twenty five yards.
this was the spray you know.
this was the area I was hitting.
it's not an accurate gun at all.
the other rifle on the other hand is.
the only problem is after you shoot it once you don't want to shoot it again.
so the the first time you shoot you hit dead on the mark.
but the next time you shoot you kind of like anticipate.
and you start getting nervous like right right.
this is what's so funny.
I'm holding it.
and I can see my breath moving the end of the gun little by little.
hmm.
and then I put my finger on the trigger.
and I know it's gonna hurt me.
and then you see my rifle start doing this.
pretty funny.
it's an experience man.
you should come.
did you did you fire anything smaller than a rifle or?
um no I fired a really crappy um rifle.
David's rifle.
it's a twenty two.
it sounds like.
it's
so so it fits David's personality.
you know just kind of like.
oh yeah actually yeah it kind of does.
um
yeah I I I asked Carlos.
and he said he says he's down to to um to oversee today's proceedings with Todd and stuff.
interesting ok.
um
I think I think he's gonna offer a good good perspectives like good notes.
like I didn't talk to him too much yesterday about it.
I just brought it up but so.
you know I figure for the first hour we can um we can just get the questions out of the way.
it it might take an hour.
write down all the questions all of them everything we can come up with.
and then we have two hours to kind of practice.
yeah.
yeah we can role play.
we can you know
yeah.
he can he can be he can be a character you know and just
yeah.
he can be the officer.
you can be the officer.
so
and he takes three different shots at him.
I mean he can he can lie the first time or
tell the truth the second time.
are you gonna turn off your thing?
my what?
your little cube?
no no I'm charging it.
oh ok.
like a yeah.
I got nervous today man.
I went I went upstairs.
I need to get there early on Wednesday.
because I was like.
like I got a like I got a little nervous you know.
so
I mean I think it's just jitters that are gonna go away within like five minutes.
I just need to like breath in the musk of that room you know.
you're uh.
you're talking about the uh the jitters you get when you go up there.
yeah like just the.
it happens to me every single time.
yeah.
I saw the woman.
I saw I saw the director.
you saw the dark Sith lord.
she looked she looked she looked ok.
she's
she looked like somebody that's not gonna
I I didn't see like I didn't see the dark force.
it's like I don't want anything from her I just
I I didn't see it either til we sat down.
she just goes.
what's her name Samantha?
she she goes up to Samantha.
and she's like.
no I'll take him.
like what?
and then when we sat down she she started telling me some stuff.
she seemed ok.
and then I started asking que asking questions.
and she.
and then give me an answer.
and then.
can I keep going?
and then I'd ask another question.
she'd give me an answer.
it's really weird.
she'd give you an answer?
she's.
in that in that face?
or wouldn't give you an answer.
yeah like in that face well she would give me an answer sometimes.
she would also use that face to dodge me.
so she kind of like her face gets stone cold when she's trying to dodge people.
mmhm.
I I I think I think I I think we need to kill her with kindness you know just
oh yeah.
it's like hello you know how's it going.
I mean like you know very
you know I have no problem being kind to the police.
I mean kind to whoever.
because this is all about survival so.
surviv I will l will like I will shake hands.
I will like do whatever it takes.
because when it's all said and done you know I can hate whoever I wanna hate at twelve o'clock at one o'clock.
at twelve o'clock.
I'm twenty four years I'm twenty five.
I'm twenty five years old.
like I can hate whoever I want for the rest of my life.
like these three hours are are big.
so
I mean I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be anything above and beyond courteous above and beyond respectful.
I mean I that that's that's my main thing.
I wanna be respectful.
because because again like whether whether the the officers
I mean I'm I'm I think she deserves respect just as an individual.
but whether the officers deserve respect or not is not a matter of intrinsically.
it's a matter of in the proceedings.
the proceedings have to be treated with respect.
because given that it's so wishy washy given that it's so shifty and unstructured respect is gonna factor in.
yeah.
you know if we're aggressive if we're you know assholish if we're whatever then
yeah you gotta
yeah.
can you can you just if possible can you just like tap me or something.
don't make it too public.
but just do something when I'm getting agressive.
because I know that when I question people maybe the first fifteen minutes is good but I I I do feel like I'm hunting them down when I get the answer I want.
maybe I can crack my fingers or something.
ok.
just just watch for that.
watch me crack my fingers.
and just calm down.
ok.
um and again like like it'll probably be you ask a question.
and then I ask a question.
and Todd asks a question.
I don't think you're gonna you're gonna be allowed to ask like consecutive questions.
it's gonna you me Todd you me Todd like that.
ok?
so which is good.
because then you know you're thinking about your next question.
we have time.
so
I was looking at this trash can.
and then I'm thinking like uh
it looks like R two d two doesn't it?
it looks like R two d two yes.
yes it looks like you know like a a coked out you know
a coked out drunk.
like yeah like technology has has has uh passed him by.
you know he's an inebriated
he's just like washed up machine.
and then he's just like he's vacant like his whole face is just like
he's just
he's missing like half his operating system.
he's just like.
beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.
he hasn't had an upgrade in years.
I mean just look at this guy.
yes.
but yeah
but I think I think I had in Spanish.
it's like like
I mean how do you say.
basurero.
basurero so it's the same thing.
you know but it's like
like the the that compound in English.
you know it's just like you're not going to find that in Spanish.
trash can.
trash and it's a can.
you know it's trash can.
like in in a in a in a in Spanish it's just like no it's like it's one item.
basurero.
it's basurero.
basurero.
that's what it
you know that's actually something I like about Spanish.
um it really combines a lot of words.
it's not um of the.
it's just del.
that's right.
just de el.
slam them together del.
yeah.
so much more efficient I think.
some of the time because when you take accents and stuff into play those acentos can be pretty
yeah but in but in but in English you have you have what they what I mean what I'm gonna call right now like like prepositional adverbials becoming becoming adjectives.
so you have uh again like a professor of French say French professor.
whereas in Spanish you don't have that.
that's right you don't.
there is that there is no.
there's always de.
yeah profesor de francés.
if you say if you say profesor francés
it means a French like literally from France.
yes yeah.
yeah.
yeah so that it's it's disambiguated.
in English you have that ambigu ambiguous possibility because of the the way you can put place um uh modifiers.
you know that's actually that's actually another reason why I prefer to write in English as to writing in Spanish.
because English does allow you to be a little ambiguous which means you can have so many more double meanings at times.
and makes it interesting.
told me that they actually want disambiguation like so
oh well uh I'm talking about like when I write like poetry or music.
ok right.
no when it comes to journalism I want crystal clear.
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.
in that case Spanish would be a little better but it's longer.
little things like that really lengthen an article.
you don't know how many times I'm like like the professor of France French professor.
yeah.
ok.
that's it that's it.
yeah this see I don't imagine this R two d two having beeps.
I I see it having like a like a.
nice.
um man like I've I've been like nauseous all day.
like just thinking about all this crap.
like I don't have my test results yet so
you know like
like I I was actually telling Marta that like you know the way the way I cope with any of this.
she still doesn't know about Wednesday.
but the way I cope with any of this is that I I take it
how do you not tell her?
because there's not point.
no I ok I know there's no point.
and you being a man of efficiency will obviously not tell her if there's no point.
yeah yeah.
like I told her.
you know when she finds out she's gonna wanna kill you.
I don't know if she's ever gonna find out.
you know it's
I mean unless like I get screwed over you know.
I guess.
yeah I mean I'm just gonna really down play it.
like because like my whole idea is that.
it's always no big deal?
it's always no big deal you know.
like had she been here had she been here I would have told her.
because I told her about the event.
I told her that evening I spoke to her.
I was like.
oh like this shit happened and whatever.
and she's like.
oh that really sucks you know.
but I just never brought it up again you know.
like I never told her when I got hearing notice.
I never told her about any of that you know.
um.
she's gonna bring it up on Wednesday afternoon.
hey you never told me what happened with that
kidding.
she what?
you know like you're kidding right.
you are joking.
do do you like uh do you like this picture?
that's nice yeah.
yeah that's good.
let's see it again?
actually I have my own copy.
you have your own copy.
get over there.
we should we should number these like.
that that's actually what I was gonna tell you right now.
I'm gonna start numbering them now.
this brings me to my the the the topic that I've been wanting to to talk about.
dime.
I have this uh when I went to
topic that you wanted to talk about.
one thing what I ever want to talk about.
always.
um one of the days that I went to Gordon beach like.
this isn't you know even supreme.
but.
no no it's just nice.
but don't you love this picture?
don't you love this picture?
what do you see?
I feel that's a door.
that's the the main like entrance door.
yeah.
and what's interesting I will ask what did you see.
and I I took these two pictures very quickly.
hello.
hi.
ok.
fine?
ok good.
ok.
ok.
ok.
ok thanks.
ok.
there you go.
you a little less nervous now?
a little bit.
all right check it out.
I I took these quickly enough so that I could ask him to describe what he sees through that window.
mmhm.
and this is what's actually in that window.
so he's like.
I see a light.
there might be a car.
there's another car.
mmhm.
um um can you please be more descriptive?
could you tell me the colour of the car?
could you tell me which way the car is going?
could you tell me if it's the front or the back of the car?
tell me all these descriptions.
and I'll be like.
well this is what it actually looked like.
and these are the things you did not include.
so if you say that you saw us throwing something that's that's funny.
there coulda been a man standing right out there.
you couldn't see him so
that's anyway.
yeah we should start numbering them.
um if you don't mind helping me.
I brought a pen.
sure sure.
um I'm going to I'm going to number um
let me figure out.
this is your first one too?
with these two people?
um see the things are not in order.
so we can just tell from the photo where each one is.
so
ok.
let's ah let's just try this.
put the map upside down.
if you don't mind actually this might be easier for you or for me.
I'm just gonna
I'm just gonna put these close to each other kind of like if I'm putting a map on paper.
um this one's closer.
yeah let's just number one set.
and then we'll just mimic the other side.
yeah yeah.
that's what we're gonna do.
but anyways that picture that you took um like ah that brings me up to like that one day that I went to go to.
and uh and I I remember this long lost like Spanish term you know which was uh which was vacilar.
vacilarte?
have you have you ever heard that?
vacilar?
I've never heard of vacilarte.
vacilar vacilar.
vacilar?
yeah vacilar a alguien.
no.
oh man like that is like such an awesome word.
because the thing about vacilar is that it it means it means to take in visually.
ok?
it also means to have fun.
so it could just mean like it's like it's like being merry you know or having fun having a good time like living it up.
you know?
that's funny I always confused being merry with being married.
sorry what did you say?
no no no being merry.
what?
so unlike you.
but ah so the whole idea was that but like vacilarse it has this it has this extra component built into the word of um of processing.
it's not just visually.
it's not it's because you see you can't directly translate it into checking it out to checking out like I checked out that girl.
you can't say like I checked her.
it's not quite the same.
it's I am I there there's an aspectual there's an aspectual component.
aspectual means like there's a there's a it's a it's more complex.
so it's not just I went to the store it's like I have gone to the store.
so you have the complexity of of perfective tense.
yeah so vacilar is like I am checking her out.
and I am in the process of checking her out.
so I am taking her in.
it's like I am drinking I am drinking her sight visually.
I am drinking the sight of her.
wow.
vacilar?
vacilar yeah.
how would you use that?
la estoy vacilando?
o o me gusta vacilarte.
me gusta vacilarte.
I mean that's really direct you know.
that's ah
you know it's like
that's
yeah o o o vacileo vacila esta niña like that.
it's like
but it's just like I I took her in.
I didn't just check her out.
it's a it's a it's a it's a renewing process of checking out.
it's like checking out for an extended period of time.
taking it all in.
you know I can't imagine that that has the same effect in English.
I mean
no no it doesn't.
estoy vacilando.
that's one thing.
yeah.
I'm inspecting you.
yeah there's no there's no
that wow
so there isn't that um that authoritative
no no no it's very it's very like it's very fluid you know.
very like just take it in you know.
it's it's like a full it's like it's like a it's like opening up the lense you know like to you know the slow slowest shutter speed.
just letting letting the entire image you know like
materialize you know just.
it's
la estoy vacilando.
yeah.
it's it's a it's a it's a serious word.
that's new in my vocabulary.
that sticks.
I mean like like I'm obsessed with it.
I'm just like like there's no equivalent.
I mean you have to say I'm scanning you.
checking you out I'm taking you in.
taking the sight of you in.
you know I am comparing you to like the you know the schema that I have in my head.
all these things are contained within that one word.
ahí.
what brought this up at?
no no no like I'm I'm I'm driving on down the street.
and I see this woman you know.
it's like then I just like turned.
it's like it's like this word just a word you know it's for this you know for like the type of.
because like we checked her out on the way there and on the way back like.
because we had to use the U turn.
I mean I got I got the full view just the full view.
it's like
it's like I've taken this woman in.
my god.
like like I understand.
you know like various aspects of her of her of her personality you know like you know visually visually.
purely visually.
of her visual personality.
that's that's the best euphemism I've ever heard.
visual persona I'd say visual persona.
like
I mean there's a difference in persona and personality.
but again like and then like you can turn it you can turn it right around and make it a make it an activity.
you know like hay que vacilar like.
hay que vacilar.
yeah the verb.
which means like in in in a general sense you know life has to be enjoyed.
you know like take in life.
you know take in a a joyous activity you know.
so
isn't it funny how that word mixes disfrutar and examinar.
disfrutar y qué?
disfrutar examinar.
examinar yeah.
that's that's that's interesting.
I wonder if there's some.
I mean you would know this better than I would if there's something in history something that happened that somehow brought those two words together if it was fun to inspect.
when was it fun to check out.
just had natural curiosity you know.
so it's of curiosity.
yeah.
Americans have no curiosity.
the thing is again if I I do I do find myself victim to to or subject to to that that clinical approach to vision.
what do you mean?
you know vision like the my my visual filter is is a is a clinical mechanism.
it's a it's an inspection mechanism.
and you lose some of that pleasure.
you know like the there's there's pleasure in sight.
you know like I look I look at a mountain side and like there's no pleasure.
you know it's it's like a shape.
you know it's it's shapes.
um and and the only thing I'm trying to do is figure out how it all works together.
what?
why?
I don't I don't get.
I don't get that that hit you know.
but like remembering that word and remembering and like and like I think like that that doesn't happen to me with women at least.
you know like certain things certain things like really catch my eye you know.
you need to take a photography class with a pretentious professor.
you need to take a photography class.
it makes you see things differently.
make you see your shapes differently.
if you take the right professor um this guy Ted Mackenzie.
not that you would ever take his class.
but if you audit it or.
yeah Valerie Valerie's told me about him like.
she was she was friends with him.
Valerie?
um ex girlfriend.
you met her.
I met her?
I think like.
yes.
couple of times yeah couple of times at least couple of times yeah.
yes.
stuff like that yeah.
yes I remember.
she brought the.
actually I said the same thing.
you brought it up the same way.
you're like.
you met her.
many times.
um well let's see.
help me out here.
this is uh thing.
this is three right?
I'm looking at it upside down.
the three.
this is close enough to be three.
this would have to be four.
this would have to be four as well.
this is kind of the general area.
um
ok this is definitely a three.
ok.
you know how to say hairline in Spanish?
I forgot.
mmhm.
hold on.
trying to think.
trying to remember like my dad shouting at my mom when I was like six years old.
me estoy volviendo calvo!
coño!
maldita sea me está pasando.
no hairline.
about hairline.
um
I mean I know I know there's like there's like in Spanish there's entradas which is which is just like like you know like it's it's it's these these areas here.
entrar.
yeah.
to the slides like going further in you know so.
we've been over this.
didn't we talk about this at Dunkin Donuts?
what about it?
I think you asked me how to say hairline in Spanish.
and I was like.
I don't know.
but I know about the entrances.
and you were like.
yeah yeah las entradas.
yeah.
no I don't remember.
I could have sworn you brought it up then.
um yeah.
I have no idea how to say hairline.
is there a Spanish dictionary over here?
look it up?
we do not we do not have a Spanish dictionary.
not that I know of.
American dictionary?
I'm not gonna look for it.
no.
don't worry about it.
but uh
hairline.
I wonder where the word calvo comes from.
calvo I don't know.
I have no idea.
or bald.
there's gotta be some base term.
mmhm.
I don't know.
so this is three.
and we'll say this is
this is kind of the same area as three.
this would have to be four.
so you're at three two threes?
yeah cause I'm I'm doing general area.
ok.
I had to make these numbers big enough so that they could see it.
I see what you're saying.
so
so you're grouping it area wise ok.
yeah.
and then I'm gonna be like.
so where were you standing in these two?
do you remember what it looked like?
because this is what it looked like from that direction.
and I can pick.
this.
that's why I don't I don't want him to be like.
I was standing in three but a little bit more to the right.
ok well here you go.
yeah this is the benefit of here where like we present this once.
there's no need to to do it over and over again.
do this over and over and over again yeah.
what did Chuck Nerris say?
um he didn't say anything.
I mean I told him like you know we we should get together after it's all said and done.
I mean he wrote me the two letters and stuff.
he wrote me I mean one of them's gonna turn into the other one.
I guess I'll get to read them.
because I've never read like any letter that anyone has ever written me so.
really?
yeah these like recommendations they're always like sealed so.
by the way don't think that you're gonna get away with taking away the poetry book.
it goes right back on my piano when you're done.
no no it's it's in it's in my car.
I noticed.
I noticed it.
sat down at the piano yesterday.
mmhm.
and I was like.
I'm gonna play.
hey where the is my poetry book.
it hadn't been touched though.
I left it on the same page.
I have been reading it.
really?
yes.
since since I showed you that poem?
because I.
a while back yeah.
because it's
I mean I showed you that poem.
and then like I left it on that page.
actually I tend to get books and leave them exactly as they are um which is probably why my book collection is like.
I don't know if you've noticed this.
it doesn't have creases.
my books don't have creases.
because if I find I'm on a certain page and I find them in a certain condition I leave it as it is so.
I I I damage my books.
I almost get like a certain joy out of it you know.
like a slight a slight damage you know like.
why?
why?
it's been read.
it's been
nah.
it's been.
I mean I mean I if I had to choose like if I could keep it in perfect form.
but I like to bend my books back.
I like to write in them
take notes.
carry them everywhere.
and if I have big cargo pockets put them in big cargo pockets.
so
this is gonna be in as well.
I'm pretty sure we can have uh two pictures for every area so he can't say you know.
it was a little bit north of that.
mmhm.
I'm not gonna fall into your trap.
you know.
you're trap.
um this is.
yeah see we're the ones setting a trap.
oh yeah we're
we're trappists.
we're absolutely trappists my friend.
fur trappers yeah.
yeah we're trapping police.
yeah.
a nice way to get rid of him.
yeah don't ask your questions too quickly.
like like rapid fire like four questions you know.
and it's just gonna make him an enemy.
you know and it's gonna make the the.
you know we want.
isn't it disgusting that if we make one the enemy the other one goes to like really.
worse.
work like this.
I I want them to be I wanna be as respectful as possible.
because I want to give them no reason
they can like.
if if we remain calm and then they become agitated like especially the police officer like officer police like
you know or you know or or.
just trying to ask a question like.
you know I I I don't I don't desire anyone to become agitated.
you know so
so if we can make him lose his cool that's great you know.
we don't lose our cool.
no we can't.
we can't.
this is seven.
um this is going to be seven as well.
we need to be very careful about Dan interrupting.
I I mean I've never seen Dan in this type of scenario so I don't know.
I don't know either.
but I know in in purely conversational settings Dan has no concept of of interruption.
I don't know what to tell you.
nope.
he will just jump in.
jump right in.
have something to say have something to say.
Dan will have nothing to say from nine o'clock to twelve o'clock unless we ask him so.
yeah we should definitely include him though.
because like we.
oh well he's part of it of course.
cause if we don't include him then then she's gonna start like taking it upon herself to include him.
yeah.
not having fun yet.
are you?
do?
ah he's Carl says he's he's got some free time.
do we need any drafting?
you've to know if you have something.
well I disagree.
there are you have to teach your children.
that there's different levels of sickness.
and there's different levels.
otherwise they wimp out at the first.
ah ya ya.
you know.
the first.
it means nothing.
well there's a pattern here honey that may.
yeah yeah yeah yeah.
but if I didn't tell you that the fever go.

I guess some wrong some happened.
right.
because this is like a screen.
but I think.
yeah I think this is open.
this is like a
so you have to put
oh ok.
ok then graphically is not.
how I see.
right.
and in the back I would maybe put something open the top just all the way across.
or something.
because there's equipement back there.
she may not see it.
just not gonna see it.
he may well look ant the the equipment.
and see what's back there.
because there is the refrigerators and stuff.
I mean you can.
what I would do is do this.
is this just the grey?
this is supposed to be
there are.
I mean I keep the pattern.
but I wouldn't bother to do this in the back.
that's what I'm saying.
they didn't keep that.
but I.
by the way have a reveal.
to do what?
and how they're making the reveal.
but the reveal makes no sense.
will it be all the way around?
so graphically it's not indicated?
we don't know who drew this but.
if there's a reveal to me the reveal is all the way.
either everywhere or nowhere.
aha I don't know what this detail.
I have to look at it.
where is it?
ten?
I mean I.
let me see whay the plan says.
let's see.
on that wall you have.
well actually you don't have as much.
ven?
para que veas.
it's this wall.
so you have this equipment here
there's.
things you've open.
refrigerators.
and then this stuff.
and I tell what that stuff is.
see that stuff is
ok.
this stuff is.
ok three forty seven is.
a puller so that's gonna be high.
three forty five is
tambien tall.
hiding cabinet.
these are tall.
four o two is probably a sink.
yeah is a work table with something else.
this is a table so this is low.
then this is up.
and this is este es pariente lo mismo.
it's probably high.
three forty eight.
yeah past through they're tall.
there's a hand sink.
y después.
this are to this.
must be is probably the same arrangement.
so aquí no va a haber nada.
you see here.
you see here here here here.
y aquí.
you could see behind the table.
but this this this equipment are tall.
so you can do something.
right that you can see.
and then this edge you can see.
and this edge you can see the one.
right.
I mean you can you can take it to.
and stop maybe to the frame.
stop on the frame.
and then you can take it from from here to here.
or maybe it's just this little piece or something.
right right.
yeah why doesn't it go all the way through.
what detail is that number again?
ten?
that's there's no such ten.
there's no such detail.
how does that work?
how does that detail work?
there's no such.
eight nine.
but how does that detail work?
I'm just curious.
it goes all the way around.
it sees there are everywhere or nowhere.
how the hell are they gonna do that?
not only that.
you need to tell him.
oh you they are not gonna do that.
because you can do this.
but your edge of your stud is here.
so you need to add a piece.
to give it.
to give.
yes which means you are gonna add a piece to get that.
and that.
no because because.
think about it Hannah.
here is your your stud.
and here is your dry wall.
are you going to are you gonna push?
beyond the stood.
well the stud is this way.
but how are you gonna push beyond the stud?
but that's not what was drawn though.
that's not what's drawn.
that's not what's drawn.
that's two tiles.
why would you do that.
why couldn't you just use a color if you wanted to create.
no a tile.
I mean that's your bullnose.
you could I mean.
I.
I mm.
what we need to do is find
to to create that we need to to
that that detail does it doesn't give the enough.
there's there's it just doesn't work.
eh it's gonna look.
right.
you have to many things.
why couldn't you use.
make that out of a different size tile.
if you wa if you wanna the reveal.
you want it at top.
I mean the tiles are four by four right?
could you make it out of.
do they come?
do you see what I'm saying?
just a different colour tile.
I mean if that's what they wanna create.
yes sir.
I started to.
and then I got sidetracked.
let me finish with it.
ok.
I eh actually.
my first question was.
and I thought I printed it.
because I.
initial tasks.
but you don't tell me what the initial tasks are.
that was a first.
ok.
I printed it.
I printed it.
and it hid from me.
somebody run off with it.
right.
right.
ok.
I printed it.
and I don't.
I don't know where the print went.
I don't know where the print went.
printed again.
because the first thing that Charles tell me is.
you listed the?
initial.
but I don't know what they are.
a tile.
I mean a tile.
a one or two inch tile.
a one by one's a tiny.
well we can do that.
but what I'm telling you is that detail.
but detail doesn't work.
you need to.
before you.
well you need to find the accesory that allows you to do that.
but you are making this a reveal or a tile.
ok.
so this this is a different detail than this detail.
to different surfaces.
this this is
this is dry wall.
this is tile.
this is back a house.
this is back a house.
I I think
we what I what I'd asked you to
if you wanna do it that's fine.
we can always value engineering.
but we need to create a detail that is buildable.
because if you give them that they ain't gonna praise it.
correct.
right.
and and what's this tile was this Gibson reveal.
see I would have I would have.
no.
if you're gonna do that then actually make it a real reveal not a tile reveal.
I wouldn't tile that.
but what if what if it.
it's.
tile tile.
and this is not a tile reveal.
there's to reveal reveal.
a dry wall reveal?
yeah.
but if you don't tell them how to make that reveal.
you ain't getting the reveal because we didn't get them any U B because we just drew a line.
then you need to get the accesories.
it's two inch.
you can paint it.
oh but then you are doing six.
so these tiles are six inches?
this is different than the old elementary schools?
mhm.
I I don't have an objection to the reveal.
but we need to make sure that we tell them how to build it.
because those details that we love to draw are not buildable.
appears so.
right right.
I have a couple of questions.
ok.
all right.
but which are.
just so you know according to the literal points that they sent us a little portion of the second floor is concrete.
ok.
ah when you start listing what's its condition.
I don't know what it is.
the building?
structure.
x I feel like one of my students.
I go.
it's too far away for me to know what you are refering to.
oh you still condition.
yeah it's part of.
right it's part of that pair right.
you just have to go back.
right it's right there right.
yeah because you are talking about that.
I would.
right.
ok.
ahm.
you have five thousand here.
then you have ten thousand back here.
ok.
ah five thousand right.
the seminar we're to.
there's a
there's a testing company that is using for the part session call.
conservation solutions I think I gave Susana the name.
so I wrote it down.
because you know.
it's good to know.
ahm.
the budget we're making.
it's in.
do you see what I'm asking?
what are we bugeting?
what it would take to rehabilitate it?
right.
but but the I guess that the definition is what what the estimate is for.
to make it a building that can be converted into something.
but it doesn't really include the lay out of what that something is.
you see what I'm saying?
right now it's not usable.
so you are gonna have to expend x amount of money to make it of viable space to be office community center whatever it is.
can we call it rehabilitation.
I mean.
because that's what you
not rehabilitation.
but what.
you know where I'm looking for.
that says
I mean you you you're trying to make it.
a building that can be functioning.
you are not talking about air conditioning or any of those kind of things.
right right right.
right because that's a right.
the then it's a rehabilitation.
it it.
deliberately open box.
right.
right right right.
not right right.
but the bulk of the budget is to make that building livable.
so use.
and then you didn't mention anything about the debris.
right.
well then you need to put it in here.
you know.
the cost is not included eh.
you know.
the contractor will be responsible.
we believe in removing current.
you see what I'm saying?
right.
but you're right here.
they are not only removing finishes.
they are removing.
joke.
may include.
oh ice.
and still we didn't spell it correctly.
right.
remove.
removal of all
ah shoring.
shoring to allow us to.
ah and you know.
when they remove the roof they are gonna have to protect it from from from the building from becoming worse.
you know what I'm saying?
I mean that.
to protect the building from further.
um what's the word I'm looking for?
we call it demolition by neglect but it's um.
further ah
I mean you're protecting the building.
I mean it's really to protect the building.
ok the other thing I had was.
we don't say anything about the outside.
there's not a whole load of it.
do we need to analyze it?
do we need to mention it?
do we need to?
in in ours will it say something about that outside.
then we maybe need to.
then my new.
space that they have there where we part.
are they cleaning.
and that's it.
leave it alone.
well then that's what we put.
there is no side analysis or.
you see I'm saying?
you know.
how may cars are gonna park here.
I don't know.
that's it.
no there's no side analysis.
you know how this people are.
what should my front door be?
I don't know.
he said.
on this street or this street.
so you know.
they may ask so that would be a following face.
you know.
what to use with the buildind.
you see what I'm saying?
is that part of our services?
a a very preliminary
concept of how do you could use this building?
because if the estimate includes.
you know.
fifty thousand dollars for air conditioning.
or how do you know your air conditioning.
your air conditioning one big space.
or you air conditioning.
fifty spaces.
right.
below.
you are right.
I mean I'm sure they are gonna ask us to do that.
but right now they are only asking us to.
no.
are you sure you raised it all?
I guess he's come back to go and say.
well that's part of your fee.
well but they they are gonna ask us to do that.
but that's not part of this.
particular moment.
and then the prices I'm assuming.
five visits that's just what they gave you right.
five.
that's why you put five maximun.
or five visits.
right.
mhm mhm.
but you are not including this one.
then question.
and see Peter mark up first structure.
but doesn't that mean that everybody gets some mark up.
but do we normally do that?
ok that that's what I'm asking.
that's what I'm saying.
you don't.
right ok.
how many hours do you think?
so
right right right.
right.
mhm not necesarily.
right.
we'll let you have that.
oh you should.
conceptual.
right.
ups.
right right right.
or it's simply part od the report now.
fifty seven hours is plenty of time for the report.
and it includes the costos.
although you do describe them almost.
separately.
so you could argue
mhm.
it's really the report.
right.
you can take it from the report.
right.
it's still the same fifty seven hours.
only you split them up between thirty seven and twenty.
right right.
and see what they say.
you know.
going and developing those drawings.
you know.
it's like.
that's true.
but don't you need some drawings to tell them how to make it.
stand up.
I'm gonna think about it.
I've gotta put a roof fine.
I I' got a roof sketched this big.
hand run fifty sixty eighty years ago.
ok mister roofer.
use this.
back then that's all we needed for today.
I don't think so.
okey dokey.
are we trying to leave a little early so we miss the crowd?
I need.
I thought about it this morning.
I said.
I need money.
I was like ah.
I don't know.
it's about a hundred square feet.
or a thousand.
it's about a hundred.
no it's a little bit bigger for.
oye.
Susi!
se fue?
el registration quel mel pusiste.
eh tiene la licencia de arquitectura pero no la mía.
or it's jus another piece of paper?
ah ok.
no porque el.
oh ok.
ah es que me diste el de John.
ah ok.
oh.
ok.
coño!
que eficiente.
asustas asustas.
ah.
ah dice que viene el martes.
sí después no hay espacio sí.
sí porque no es tan lejos but still.
ok.
bueno.
there are plenty of new um alternatives.
aha.
regarding um birth control pills.
yeah.
sí pero es que yo no quiero.
but ah they they they they're not as strong as they were a couple of years ago.
yeah.
pero es que también es que
like ah like ah in the sixties they were terrible!
yeah.
yeah they were.
like too strong.
too too much strong.
too much.
yeah no no.
but now the dose is so slight.
basically.
but look at this.
eso es homeopathic.
eso lo que tengo que.
I wanna I wanna do more natural things because I really.
I'm already on medication.
I'm already on Effexor.
and I've been on antidepressants since I was seventeen.
so, I've already been fucked.
you know I've already had my body being dependent on on medicine.
I don't want to take even more medicine if I could find something else that helps me.
but I wouldn't say that hormones are.
I don't know.
for me it's a natural way to regulate stuff.
yes but.
but I could find.
yeah but those things those things are synthetic hormones.
that's why they're more powerful.
they have more side effects.
that's the problem.
and I know I know I have to do I I have to be better about my diet and all that stuff.
I have to eat healthier.
I'm actually starting to eat.
sí is it like a generic um?
yeah it's genetic because my mom
so it's not ah it's not something that was like
qué?
the these pills.
no no no eso es eso es totalmente natural.
eso es.
I think that they need to consider your ah weight and blood type and stuff.
no eso es totalmente natural.
entonces.
when they do a good one ah ah like let's say a costumised ah homeopathic stuff
the thing is I went to.
like if this is generic ah I think it's it's ah still effective
it's still effective.
pero cómo te digo?
I know I know.
I know I need to find I need to find
el el real homepático ah medicina homeopática.
es que yo lo.
ajá.
el doctor te mira.
y te analiza el tipo de sangre um y otras características.
mmhm.
sí yo tengo que.
y de acuerdo con tu peso tu tipo de sangre tu personalidad y otras cosas.
es que yo no he hecho eso yo no he hecho eso.
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
that's the thing.
I've been.
that's what I think.
I've been.
this this might be even more effective if a real homeopathic doctor like.
es que no es que no he tenido receta.
this is all prescribed.
I I need to go to a good homeopath.
and the thing is that a lot of them are not covered under regular health insurance.
mmhm.
so you have to pay the whole.
you have to pay extra.
I don't know maybe later ah in a couple of minutes we can check some books there in.
yeah yes this is also good.
I was going to say Starbucks eh Barnes and Noble because.
I'm also.
there's always ways that you can help yourself.
that's why I also have that.
it's a massage oil.
I put it on my womb en el vientre por aquí y por detrás.
así que eso me calma también.
y qué tiene eso?
esto tiene eh el coconut oil.
eso es coconut oil.
so you have your kit.
ah yo tengo mi kit.
tú tienes.
sí sí.
grape seed oil lavanda eh este eh aceite de trigo.
like herbs and natural components whatever.
sí eh sí sí sí.
eh eh el bueno te voy a decir lo que es el lo el lo de aromaterapia.
yes.
it might help.
but the good stuff is that it's never going to do anything like wrong to you like it's not going to affect you negatively.
no exactamente.
that's why I like it.
and there might be a a good effect.
lavender.
there's lavender que eso es lavanda.
y este cómo es
clary sage es es salvia.
sage es salvia.
eh
ah sí yo no sabía.
eh sí.
salvia.
este los otros aceites son aceites de tú sabes para que sean masajes para que se se dilutan.
they so they dilute.
diluyan.
para que se diluyan.
y también este
so by the way.
sí porque eso es bien concentrado.
sometimes sometimes you you get words in English.
and you force them to look like Spanish.
yeah exactly.
yeah.
y jazmín.
sometimes you can guess that.
and sometimes you can make it like.
but dilute it's not how how do you say?
no sé.
?
eh no eh I know.
it's diluyan sí sí.
diluir.
diluir diluir exactamente.
I don't know.
it's good that you're doing this stuff.
and and you have your things to take care of yourself.
it's good.
it's good.
but still I what I was telling you is that we can check a couple of books and maybe ah like self help something.
and I actually need to check some books for myself.

esto tiene eh eh manzanilla.
eh dandelion.
eh no sé cómo se dice.
and how long.
how long are your eh periods?
este.
for how long?
three days five six?
no siete.
fuck!
yo sangro por siete días.
!
no y por eso le dije hoy.
no puede ser de verdad?
sí.
por eso yo le dije a mami.
este thanks for giving me your your like thanks for giving me your bloody peri you know your strong periodos.
for having inherit.
and she is like.
you're welcome.
exactly.
sí eso es.
eso se eso es de
oh that's a huge inconvenience!
eso es de de.
yeah I know.
seven days!
sí.
no está.
lo que pasa es que los primeros como dos o tres días me siento como que.
este tengo fatiga.
y después este estoy agitada y.
y como que crispy y
ah
you know you you know what?
consider all the all the facts of ah just been a woman.
it's just yeah it's a pain of fucking ass.
yeah like quarter of the time you have blood in yourself like you are bleeding.
yo.
yes.
like one week every four.
no every.
yeah.
mmhm.
so like a quarter.
cada mes.
quarter of the month you are bleeding.
veintiocho días veintiocho días.
and then you can have your own pleasure and eh have sex and whatever.
but if you get pregnant you need to give birth through there.
yeah.
y eso y eso se estira.
and it's painful.
y eso se estira.
no se estira no.
yo no estoy de acuerdo con eso.
I don't like like natural birth.
for me natural birth it's just unnatural.
you think it's barbaric.
yeah it is.
it was another way for God to punish people.
women once again.
yeah yeah yo yo pensaba mira
sí yo alguna vez me caso y le pido a mi esposa que por favor no tenga un parto natural porque eso es mucho dolor y mucha sangre.
no.
no no no pero eso es lo mejor porque la cesárea.
it is not going to.
no la cesárea es peor la cesárea es peor.
no I know that it I I I.
but the the person will be able to keep the same shape and the the muscle tone and everything.
carajo carajo you're thinking of you're thinking about oh you don't want I don't want I don't want my my wife to have stretch out her puss her tight pussy.
yeah.
I am thinking that.
well.
why would I want it that that way like eh I don't know it's so uncomfortable.
pero es no es peor James porque.
tú te imaginas.
la persona se recupera más rápido con un parto natural.
no.
exactamente yeah.
adelgaza más rápido.
sí.
es mejor en muchos sentidos.
sí.
pero la destruye por allá.
pero para.
it it's going to must likely the person is going to be like loose.
and that's why you do Kegel muscles.
oh not enough.
I wouldn't say that it's enough.
I don't know.
I don't like that.
ah you know that I I have blood phobia.
did you know that?
what?
no no sabía no sabía.
blood phobia.
in Spanish is hematofobia.
sí que eso no te gusta ver sangre.
ah who likes to see blood?
a mí tampoco.
no one.
a mí tampoco.
but I can I I could faint.
no ah coño tú eres como mi papá.
you're just like my dad.
I'm I'm becoming stronger.
but ah like ten years ago.
no.
my dad was just the same.
if if if I happens to see like running blood or something like that I feel disgust and I feel weak and I.
ajá.
it's like my type kryptonite.
that's the point about freaking where I always.
sí sí sí sí kryptonite.
kryptonite yeah.
no mi mi papá era igual.
mi papá eh él no él se tuvo se las tuvo que aguantar para estar en el parto de en el parto mío.
so it's not just about a loose vagina.
it's about blood too.
I do not like when I don't know people is bleeding.
yeah.
I I could faint as I told you.
and I'm becoming stronger.
but um how can I say this?
once I was um giving blood.
mmhm.
and ah this black guy that it was doing it was so careless.
mmhm.
once again we're talking about that.
and the guy I I told him I told I told him
and we're talking about we're talking about niggers not black people.
calla.
don't say that.
eh the the
there's a difference.
there's a difference.
what?
I I I don't want to talk about that because we already talked about that.
ok.
ok yeah yeah yeah.
and um
I don't know.
ok ok yeah.
he was being careless.
so yeah even if he's black or not um.
yeah he was no no te te acribilló.
I ah.
que casi te mata.
not always expect the best type of service from ah from
ajá.
from health people.
especially health.
I don't know.
que te estaba.
no no encontraba la vena y te estaba pinchando.
I guess.
I told him I told him clearl clearly.
ah I I'm I'm more than happy to give blood.
I am going to try.
but I I have blood phobia.
mmhm.
and I could faint.
so I need you to be close to me and talk to me and stuff like that for me not to think about what I am doing and feel and imagine what I'm doing because.
te da cosa.
I yeah.
it it could happen if I if if my mind is focused on that.
es es lo que yo te estaba diciendo.
sí sí sí.
que la mente no se debe enfocar en los problemas porque los ve más grandes.
sí.
so bueno pues mira te cuento.
ajá.
y el el tipo me puso la la inyección.
y se fue.
y yo me quedé ahí.
entonces tratando de pensar otra cosa otra cosa otra cosa.
y no fui capaz.
entonces cuando me miré el brazo I I I just no sé empecé a pensar sangre estoy estoy sangre sangre.
te te dio.
yeah.
y me sentí mal.
you got a hot flush.
sí.
me sentí mal.
hot flushes?
sí.
yo creí que eso solamente le daba a las mujeres.
no eso es que te da que te da el sudor.
so that un un hombre puede tener hot flushes?
sí pues claro te daba sudor.
te estabas sudando.
y te te sentías pálido tú sabes.
te como que un calentón como que.
ok.
he was just negligent.
así eso es negligencia.
because I told him I I I could faint.
yeah.
so be here.
and talk to me like.
exactly.
I don't know.
if I'm doing this for you because I do not like it and I know that I could faint.
mmhm.
mmhm.
I'm doing it because I want to be nice and maybe help a child or something like that.
mmhm.
but he just left me there.
so I fainted.
mmhm.
and when I faint I pulled my my my arm and it removed the needle.
mmhm.
so there was blood all around the floor.
oh!
and and I just fainted.
and it was so deep.
and I felt like shit.
have you fainted once or?
sí.
when they ah I almost fainted right after the when they did this.
yeah.
because I was like freaking out about the pain.
so.
it was painful?
they.
it was painful.
pero es que yo me me me.
I was just like thinking
I was like tired.
I was really.
it's just a piercing you know.
I know.
pero es que no me gusta el dolor.
and the needle.
no me gusta el dolor.
no.
type of piercings.
those are even more painful.
I know I know.
pero no eh eh el muchacho.
it's crazy.
el muchacho que que pasamos vamos a pasar después y lo te lo te lo conoz te lo te lo presento.
estaba así.
y yo vomité.
me hicieron eso.
pero yo estaba tan mareada del del del del del del de la situación que yo vomité.
y él como.

it's like it's like you're dying.
I know.
like you feel like you're losing yourself.
like oh my God!
and fuck and you feel so weak.
I almost fainted no I almost fainted at the at at at ah his place.
and helpless.
you have no idea what it is to be actually in that position.
so I had.
it happened to me like five times or six.
and it's.
oh I hate it.
no no what I'm trying to tell you is I did not faint.
but I was this close to fainting because I threw up.
not the same stuff.
what if you start to faint?
I can understand.
would you would you.
no you you have no idea.
when you actually faint when you lose your ah consciousness.
ajá.
consciousness.
you feel like crap.
it's even worse.
because I have been in your.

stop!
oh.
remember wisdom.
qué te dije?
continue.
tú tienes que aprender a a a abrir los ojos.
y abrir las orejitas.
mmhm.
porque la sabiduría entra por los ojos y las orejitas.
a veces tú no me has escuchado en absoluto lo que estoy diciendo.
déjame terminar.
ok.
que tú que me dices que yo hablo mucho.
ya te voy a acabar de decir.
ah I have felt like you like you have like you have felt like ah I'm about to to lose my consciousness.
mmhm.
yeah.
and it's terrible.
it's not nice to be in that position.
but actually losing the consciousness is worst.
mmhm ok.
so you do not know that part.
ok.
so it has has happened to me that I have like lost my consciousness.
and it's terrible.
it's like um a small death.
mmhm.
something like that.
pero lo que te estaba diciendo qué era?
ah bueno yo veo sangre y me desmayo.
ajá.
so then I have plenty of reasons for not ah I don't know support natural birth.
mmhm.
it's so unnatural and painful.

and most likely the person is going to get a loose vagina.
mmhm.
and even the doctor put the hands inside the vagina to pull the placenta.
mmhm.

placenta how do you say that?
yeah yeah.
the placenta.
yeah placenta.
in English.
placenta.
that's that's it.
how do you pronounce it?

ok so so the doctor takes the placenta.
ajá.
, out of the woman like pulling it with with his own.
yeah.
like the whole hand goes inside.
and it's so barbaric!
yeah.

and it's not just about our myself and my pleasure but about the blood and and.
.
mmhm.
I don't know.
it's it's it's terrible.
I was bueno te digo que yo soy brava porque yo fui la fotógrafa el parto de mi hermana.

when when when it's growing
you're talking about infertile.

yo sé yo sé todo eso.
pero es muy cara.

son unas hojitas dulces.
que tú las coges.
y las secas.
y te las metes en la boca y te endulzan.
sí yeah.

y sin una sola caloría.
es es eso es esto mismo.
um.
stevia leaf esto es.

sí por eso es que estos tés son bien caros.
esos esos tés son orgánicos.
y son hechos como en la en la tradición hindú de Ayur Ayur Ayur
Ayurdeva.
yeah eso eso mismo!
Ayurdeva.
Ayurvedic.
um.
you know that I used to be a Hare Krishna?
yes you told me.
and I used to be a lot of things.
so let's let's count them down.
oh the list is huge.
I know.
you told me it was eighteen.
um you might not know about some of them like er espiritismo.
pues claro sí yo sé sé de eso.
but not like in the movies like.
oh my God!
no no no no yo sé como New Age.
it's not like a medium like with blank eyes like doing weird stuff.
no no no yo sé the New Age cuando así que tú sabes
just some way to relax and get in touch with a um spirit that eh has some wisdom.
the chakras.
yes.
not any other spirit.
aha.
depends on the medium.
aha.
but what happens is that they they they make connection.
and the spirit speaks about the medium like through the medium.
mmhm.
and I found it really interesting.
so in that group I I happened to learn about the real espiritismo.
mmhm.
how do you say that in English?
like spiritism?
no er it's called um New Age.
eso es New Age.
eso es lo que llaman espiritismo en español o ciencia espírita.
sí si yo sé.
yo sé.
yo estuve en tres de esos.
tres diferentes.
cuáles cuáles?
tres diferentes grupos.
pero dame los nombres de los grupos.
Cima se llamaba uno.
Asonde se llamaba otro.
aha.
aha.
eh y el otro cambio de nombre después.
pero pero fueron esos tres básicamente.
aha.
eh también estuve en el Círculo Efe.
ajá.
eh and I was looking for eh ah third type encounters.
how you call those?
los U F Os?
yeah.
estuve estuve en el monte en las montañas buscando extraterrestres.
then I became a Hare Krishna part time.
mmhm.
a part time Hare Krishna.
yeah.
so I used to be like vegetarian.
but sometimes I had my my meat.
mmhm.
and I went to this um a ceremonias.
.
en la mañana.
el el.
and I used to sing with them and stuff like that but just part time.
.
oh it was so I.
lo que a mí me gustaba de Coconut Grove es que ahí está el templo Hare Krishna.
y ahí ellos antes se pasaban así.
cantando eso eso eso ellos ellos cantan
la procesión.
a veces cantan para recoger dinero.
aha.
y para coger donaciones se llama prasha.
aha.
y es para para coger comida gratis.
y darle comida a los demás.
mmhm.
para que la gente que tiene hambre coma y aprenda el Bhagavad Gita.
it's like marketing.
sí.
so they sing and they get free food from the market people.
mmhm.
I don't know.
they they give away food.
they prepare the food.
and if there's a homeless guy or someone they have like meetings.
and they they they give away people for food.
eh es como una misión?
es misión?
but you need to first listen the Bhagavad Gita.
and then you get the soup.
oh no.
eso no eso no es cristiano.
so if you're hungry you can become a Hare Krishna.
just get the soup and then get the Bhagavad Gita and sing with us and dance with us and
oye eso no es.
it's kind of a manipulation.
no eso no es.
porque por lo menos los cristianos le daban los misioneros
it's it's it's it's marketing.
it's a good way to I don't know give someone a a bowl of soup and some I don't know comfort for the soul.
no no no porque eso no se supone que sea así.
porque por lo menos.
lo que mi entendimiento de las misiones católicas.
en eh le daban comida.
no impor y después si querían querían aprender del cristianismo pues le enseñaban.
pero eso no era de.
ok so it's a mission.
we give you food.
and if you want to hear about er Jesus Christ that's fine.
you're more than welcome.
but a couple of centuries ago you do not want to hear about Jesus Christ so you are going to lose your head.
I know.
decapitated!
we have come we have come a long way por lo menos.
yeah but we were counting.
like Hare Krishna.
Hare Krishna sí.
and I had well my mantras and my stuff.
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare!
qué significa eso?
es una forma de bendecir al señor Krishna.
aha.
y agradecerle por la existencia.
pero es bonito.
eso se supone que te relaja.
aha.
eh fue interesante.
ellos suelen meditar.
aha sí sí sí.
meditar.
y comer saludable.
son personas sanas buenas.
los monjes hacían eso.
hmm.
hmm.
sí.
hacían los vespers cada
sí.
estuve en otro grupo que llamaban Madame Blavatsky H P B.
aha.
que era como de metafísica.
estuve en uno que se llamaba El Subuth.
que era un poco extraño.
y estuve muy poco tiempo ahí porque yo visitaba mucho y no me gustaba y me iba.
aha.
a ver estuve en otro que se llamaba
eh Rosacrucismo.
mmhm.
cómo le dicen en inglés?
no sé.
no me acuerdo cómo se dice.
y qué otro estuve?
El Cuarto Camino.
estuve en El Camino.
estuve en.
estuve también en en este de.
que eso fue hace veinte años.
fue hace como diez.
estaba yo muy joven.
aha.
en el cómo se llama este?
el de este negrito que tiene el el lleno de pelo grande que hace magia.
ay carajo!
cómo se llama?
mm
Satia Saibaba.
Saibaba es muy conocido en India.
es que en India hay hay más de mil religiones reconocidas.
sí sí.
and and then I just read that er I wasn't able to find God or find inner peace.
mmhm.
so I just eventually stopped looking.
and I became a rebel.
and I just told.
un rebelde sin causa.
yeah like just told Jesus or whatever god or representation there was at that time in my mind.
mmhm.
it's ok I'm just tired of looking for you.
and I got nothing.
I feel nothing.
I I haven't got any more faith.
so I'm just going to stop looking.
if you want to see me just look for me.
so I'm not going to look for you.
mmhm.
um I don't know.
then I became a atheist and then agnostic and plenty of stuff.
and then I came here to the U S seven years ago.
and attend like Christian meetings and Christian churches and stuff.
protestante.
yeah protestante.
and at the end I just realised that I am just a Catholic person that wants to be better.
and er I don't know I'm just trying to be a good man.
un besito.
no no no un besito.
no un poquito no un poquito no.
ay!
ok un besito en la.
así que regresastes.
regresastes a la familia.
por lo menos busca por lo menos este entendemos que o sea los católicos entendemos que esto es un proceso.
porque y nos tenemos que ayudar los unos a los otros.
eh al al a la meta que es la santidad.
pues eh Jesus nos dijo que este todos podíamos ser santos.
mmhm.
y por eso es que yo fui amada por él.
a hacer un apostolado de los the ravers.
ravers?
?
ravers?
no no tengo ni idea qué es eso.
es es lo lo la la la gente joven que le gusta la música electrónica.
rave music?
sí.
música electrónica?
sí techno.
eso no me gusta.
este.
bueno no importa que no te guste.
pero como a mí me gusta.
y como en verdad.
so like techno music?
me encanta me.
isn't that the one that people use to get stoned or get high with these ecstasies?
sí sí sí.
sí.
pero es que yo a mi me gustaba.
yo probé éxtasis a los veintiuno.
pero yo a mi me encantaba esa música ya de joven.
I have never tried ecstasies.
a los.
I just smoked marijuana for a couple of years.
a los dieciséis.
a los dieciséis los diecisiete me yo oía esa música.
just minor stuff.
marijuana just.
but you know what?
bueno.
what?
I I want to try sooner or later in my life at least once L S D.
uy!
at least once.
no te no te lo.
bueno es que como yo tengo mis issues.
pues no te lo recomiendo.
yo traté algo que era similar era L S A.
era unas era unas semillas.
se llamaban Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.
y yo hice un té.
se supone que eran con cinco semillas.
it was something natural?
sí.
so then it's not L S D.
L S D is totally a chemical stuff.
no esto es esto es esto es L S A.
en vez de D es L S A.
that has nothing to.
well L S D L S D is is is er is made in a lab.
sí sí no es es similar.
no no no cállate.
no.
yo he leído todo esto.
I I
so it's some sort of seed that cause the same effect like L S D or something like that?
yes.
yes!
yes.
but they're some sort of mushrooms or something like that?
no no no no es una semilla se llama Hawaii.
I might try something natural maybe.
lo que lo que pa lo que pasó fue.
bueno es que yo quiero que tú aprendas de mi experiencia.
este lo que pasó fue que.
I know about your experience.
but you know what?
still.
I told you the other day.
er sometimes life is like flat.
like without I don't know intereses o intensidades o
mmhm.
sometimes just being an adult is a little boring.
yes I know.
and you can drink sometimes.
mmhm.
and you feel different.
could be nice to drink once in a while.
mmhm.
you can smoke cigarettes which is stupid.
mmhm.
the worst thing that you can do.
like Marlboro ones.
mmhm.
you can smoke some marijuana.
o Lucky Strike.
that I used to smoke marijuana.
and for me it was great.
mmhm.
um
pero es que.
and I experienced nothing wrong about that and nothing.
but er I never tried anything else.
mmhm.
so lo que te estoy diciendo es que cuando yo fumé marijuana.
yo sentí cosas que no sentí jamás de otra forma.
sí.
so there wasn't for me any other way to feel what I felt
no.
through marijuana just with marijuana.
even I I can experience what is love
um what it is to drink.
different things.
but what marijuana marijuana made me feel nothing else would have made me feel.
mmhm.
you understand what I'm saying?
yes completely understand.
and I yo no me arrepiento de haber fumado marijuana.
and it's just marijuana for a couple of years.
mmhm.
so er and I just stopped doing it.
mmhm.
it was so easy to just not do it I just decided not to do it.
and I stopped doing it.
but still I know that there are some ways to feel things in life that just flat main basic emotions are not going to make you feel.
just like that.
because I I I might love someone
ese es ese es ese es el espíritu santo.
yeah the Holy Spirit is nice but er but er ah
no ese es el espírtu santo.
no I have never felt nothing close to the espíritu santo never.
no porque tú no tú no
I do not have faith.
because.
I I was not raised to have faith.
sí pero.
and I have looked for that.
and I I wanted to have faith but er
mira tú tú necesitas cate tú necesitas un cate tú necesitas catecismo
I'm still a very nice person and I I
but you know what?
I am actually one of the.
I don't know.
I consider myself a useful person a nice person that has been doing nice stuff for people all his life.
yeah.
.
I I always have been useful.
so I'm a good citizen.
yeah.
and maybe not really with a big faith.
but um I have been better than other people that have faith and has done bad stuff.
sí pero sí pero imagínate si tú si tuvie si tú tuvieras fé.
con la buena persona que tú eres tienes que pedir a Dios.
dame fé Dios.
yo quiero creer en ti.
yo creo que sí es cierto.
si yo tuviera más fé sería una persona mejor tal vez más feliz pero bueno.
uno.
bueno lo que te estaba diciendo era lo siguiente este
aha.
yo sé que ya no fumo nada ni hago nada.
pero un día de estos me gustaría probar algo una sola vez.
mmhm.
just give a try once.
and something that is going to make me feel something different and nice.
exciting.
something.
I don't know er an experience out of myself.
something!
and I I have heard that L S D can make you feel like that.
yeah yeah.
yeah.
so just once maybe.
no bueno es es que
and then keep on with my life.
es que tú sabes que yo tuve tan mala esperiencia.
yo te yo te estoy cuidando por lo menos yo te estoy.
yo te estoy cuidando porque yo no
yo sé pero yo tengo claro que solamente es una vez y ya.
sí.
pero lo lo
es es lo que mucha gente dice no pero
.
pero tal vez no lo haga nunca tal vez.
I I might never do it but
déjame déjame hablar.
lo que pasó fue que la primera vez que lo hice hice los cinco nada más es cinco.
tú haces un té con cinco cinco semillas.
cinco qué?
cinco semillas.
you grind them.
ok.
las semillas esas Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.
you grind them.
y me dijo.

pero no es que you love him more than you love me.
hmm.

so she doesn't talk to anyone.
entonces
I didn't know that she was that bad.
hasta que se se emborrachó.
y ahí fue que que caí en cuenta y yo dije bueno o sea.

María me hizo caminar cuarenta cuadras.
esta el autobús nos dejó desde New Jersey.
nos dejó en la ciento setenta y ocho in Broadway.
ok ya con las calles.
mi hermanita bella.
no ya te lo juro que estoy demasiado ubicada ya más que Alberto.
porque el vive en Queens en Manhattan.
pero tú tienes buena memoria para esas cosas.
y soy o sea.
entonces llega.
y la niña me daba miedo.
el el celular que me compré.
a ya ajá.
le daba miedo montarse en el subway porque ella no sabía.
sabes no sabía cómo qué agarrar y tal.
y yo le digo.
Valeria.
sabes me hizo caminar desde la ciento setenta y ocho hasta la ciento treinta.
en tacones.
oh no y ella obviamente en tennis shoes.
y yo y que.
obviously.
ok that's what she wears.
y yo y que ok.
hasta que llegó un momento que yo dije.
ya no no ya.
María we are getting on the subway whether you like it or not.
bajamos que fue cuando el tipo nos dijo.
just take that one sabe y.
it's my first time in New York by myself.
first time getting a subway in New York by myself.
y yo y que.
ok.
scare paranoid obviamente.
estaba demasiado paranóica así como que ok sabes?
me dijeron que esto es un malandreo sabes que.
claro.
ten cuidado.
y de paso que cuando nos dejó en la ciento setenta y ocho.
estamos caminando.
y María llama a la mamá de la amiga y le dice.
mira estamos en la ciento setenta y ocho.
sálganse de ahí.
que eso es un barrio que no sé qué broma y tal.
y yo y que.
what?
sí que eso es un barrio y tal.
yo llamo a Alberto.
y no me contesta.
y yo le dejo un mensaje.
Alberto llámame.
rescátame que estamos en un barrio.
ayúdame.
no sé cómo llegar salirnos de aquí y tal.
Alberto me dice.
no sabes no es un barrio.
si no que ahí hay mucho mucha gente que todo el mundo te te va a echar los perros.
sabes todo el mundo te va a decir cosas.
pero no les pares sigues caminando y ya.
y yo bueno ok entonces yo le digo a María.
María camina rápido.
y como si supieras a dónde vamos.
o sea no tengas cara de perdida.
y ella.
bueno ok.
entonces las dos caminando cuarenta cuadras hasta que por fin nos montamos en el subway.
y bueno ya ahí sí llegamos a Time Square buenísima.
y nada entonces ellos se fueron.
y Alberto.
sabes y eso fue.
fuimos a Pace University.
ese día solo fuimos a Pace.
pero caminamos todo Time Square.
sabes ese día caminamos.
no fuiste al Empire State luego?
no.
es que fue un viaje de universidad.
o sea no fui al Empire State.
no fui a.
no fui a nada.
la estatua de la libertad no?
a nada.
mija.
pero es que uno.
you went to the life of New York literally.
exacto.
en vez de los tourist place.
pero es que the thing is that I wasn't there.
sabes no estaba ahí para para hacer eso.
no claro.
sino ir a las universidades y ya.
pero o sea tu opción es N Y U.
en enero.
pero.
así cuál es your second option?
ah?
mi second option o sea no yo voy a aplicar a todas.
en N Y U no puedo aplicar ahorita.
entonces en agosto aplico para empezar en enero.
y ahorita sabes voy a aplicar en todas las que vi.
vi como ocho universidades.
y vas a seguir con psicología o no?
sí.
sí pero no.
o sea sí por los momentos.
pero si de aquí me decido por otra carrera me voy a cambiar.
porque sabes que a mí me gusta es la moda y el diseño y la actuación y todo eso.
entonces estamos en la oficina de la tipa que está en el sexto piso.
y en el edificio de enfrente.
sabes es pura vitrina entonces en el edificio de enfrente también estaban otras tipas en en la en otra en otra oficina.
estaban todas apagadas menos en esa.
y habían cinco mujeres.
entonces una se quita la camisa.
y se pone otra y no sé qué broma.
y la gente sabes.
como que era una broma de de diseño.
que diseñaban camisas.
I don't know.
cómo se dice?
no sé.
no sé o sea que que they were hemming the shirt.
sabes como que fitting it.
y era sabes como como una compañía de diseño.
ya.
entonces yo estoy viendo eso.
y yo dije.
perro te imagina qué fino sería estudiar diseño en Nueva York.
y estar en una oficina así diseñando ropa.
y yo dije.
sabes?
me llama demasiado la atención.
y entonces sabes me puse a pensar.
y yo y que.
perro y si me cambio de psicología y no sé qué broma en N Y U?
chama te lo juro estuve a punto.
sabes yo dije.
me voy a cambiar a estudiar business.
solo porque mira en N U U tienen un programa.
no sé cómo haces para entrar en el programa.
cuando estudias business que hay un programa que tienes la opción de estudiar o sea los cuatro años de carrera.
el primer año en Nueva York el segundo en París el cuarto en Londres y el quinto en Shanghai.
perro.
o sea yo vi eso.
y yo y que.
no voy a estudiar psicología voy a estudiar business.
pero N Y U es carísima no?
sí.
son cincuenta mil al año including the dorms.
without dorms it's like thirty thirty five.
perro.
pero los dorms están.
tú te conoces más o menos Manhattan?
sabes Time Square está en la cuarenta y dos y.
y o sea y la siete y la ocho está por ahí.
los dorms nuevos de N Y U para upper classman que es que sería yo quedan en la veintitrés y la tercera avenida.
o sea queda yo fui a a college que queda en ahí.
y caminamos hasta Time Square que sabes son veinte cuadras.
que ya para mí las cuadras son veinte pasos.
caminas más rápido o no?
sí lo peor es que sí.
entonces sabes entonces el tipo nos dice.
the the new dorms have wood floors.
counter top de granito.
lavadora y secadora adentro del apartamento.
perro nice.
sabes es una cosa que yo dije.
en ese dorm sí me quedo.
sabes o sea en los otros dorms los vi.
y son horribles horribles.
pero tú hiciste tours en las universidades?
sí sí a todas.
ah ok.
la única que no hice el tour de la universidad fue N Y U.
porque fui.
o sea era una hora del del una hora y media del information session.
y la otra era del del del colegio.
pero sabes después del information session me gustó tanto que yo dije.
la verdad no me importa.
y de paso que ya María estaba cansada.
entonces sabes se quería regresar.
entonces no hicimos el tour ese.
pero hicimos.
sabes el information session.
te lo juro solo con eso los profesores son los mejores.
todo es así demasiado fino.
fue la que más me llamó la atención.
entonces son cincuenta mil al año con los dorms.
y treinta y entre treinta y treinta y cinco.
no me acuerdo sin los dorms o sea el tuition nada más.
pero sabes estoy aplicando a lo del.
para que me den broma.
claro.
y voy a aplicar a becas.
y toda broma sabes obviamente all the help I can get.
claro.
ayuda.
pero del resto sabes no.
ay no sé estoy demasiado emocionada.
me quiero ir ya sabes.
ay si bueno nosotros Bruce y yo tenemos.
ahorita por lo de la clase y la broma.
either he is gonna take a semester here as a transient student.
uhuh.
and then wait until I graduate.
or I don't know if I'm gonna go there.
y hacer una clase en U C L es la última que me falta.
a ver si me aceptan el crédito.
bueno.
porque Olga hizo eso.
ah.
porque Olga se graduó en U T.
y se fue para D C.
y le faltaba una clase.
and the college or the university whatever took that credit.
y se lo dio a U t para que le dieran el diploma.
sí?
pero ella fue.
entonces.
ella aplicó como transfer.
no sé tengo que preguntarle.
por que.
en las universidades que vi yo o sea los transfer students aceptan como sesenta y ocho créditos.
no te los aceptan.
sabes if I have ninety credits and I wanna transfer they only accept sixty eight.
o sea.
sería un credit que me lo tiene que aceptar es F I U.
será?
I don't know.
no no sé si se puede pero tienes que averiguarlo.
pero eso sería para para cuándo?
sí tengo que.
para agosto.
o sea para mudarte en agosto a Orlando.
para mudarme en agosto a Orlando.
ah porque yo te conté del trabajo no?
que la tipa me dijo.
I don't know what your plans are.
pero te quería ofrecer un salón for yourself.
what?
y yo y que.
duh my work is so good no I'm kidding.
no pero I don't know.
she likes my work.
so she wanted me to do my.
qué en serio?
pero ella me dijo.
I don't know your plans are.
y yo le dijo.
well the plan is I wanna get married.
a porque Bruce dijo y que.
a bueno si nos vamos.
porque we're planning to go the whole family.
his family and my family for Christmas on a cruise.
mentira.
for Christmas.
oh my god it's so serious.
son doce personas.
I know.
o sea mi mamá el novio.
a porque por los momentos mi mamá no se va a casar porque la hija de él de veinticinco años tiene un gato.
entonces mi mamá le dijo.
porque ella se iba a mudar a casa de él cuando se casara.
mmhm.
y viven él y ella y el gato.
pero el apartamento de tu mamá todavía o sea no lo va a vender.
no ese es para nosotros.
exacto.
entonces escucha.
entonces mi mamá le dijo.
bueno how about.
y ella le dijo que.
I'll move in but you gotta get rid of the cat.
ok.
exacto.
mi mamá odia los gatos los animales cualquier cosa.
mi mamá y que.
aparte de que ella y que.
el gato vomita a cada dos minutos en el sofá.
asco.
y mi mamá tiene que remodelar todo el apartamento por por aquel problema de la esposa la ex mujer.
ajá.
y entonces ella y que.
you have to get rid of the cat because if we're gonna get new.
sabes y aparte que bota mil pelos.
si no no no.
mi mamá y que.
no no.
los gatos son traicioneros.
entonces.
sí entonces mi mamá y que.
bueno you know what I'm just get a new like you have to get rid of the cat or or I'm not gonna move in.
exacto.
entonces él y que.
bueno entonces le dijo a Mariela que tiene veinticinco años la hija de él.
le dijo.
mira Mariela nos vamos a tener que get rid of.
se llama Apolo el gato.
ok.
entonces dijo.
Apolo has to leave.
porque aparte él ya estaba estresado porque ese día vomitó tres veces en el sofá.
y entonces sabes él le dijo a Mariela.
we have to get rid of Apolo.
y que se puso a llorar como una niña de un año.
y tiene veinticinco años?
que ese es mi gato que no me lo van a quitar que no sé qué.
entonces mi mamá dijo.
ok gracias a Apolo me di cuenta de que va a hacer un pelo difícil vivir con ella porque mi mamá dice.
I'm moving into a house where I wanna be the queen.
la la mujer de la casa exacto.
sabes mi mamá y que.
pero no porque es ella porque es su casa.
entonces él ella dijo.
él dijo.
bueno vamos a mudarnos a tu apartamento.
y entonces mi mamá y que.
ok.
entonces él dijo.
bueno son cuatro cuartos mi apartamento.
y él dijo.
bueno un cuarto sería.
obviamente él y mi mamá cuando se casen.
y sería la niñera con Mario.
el niñito de un año y medio.
ajá.
y sobra un cuarto para mi hermano y para mi.
entonces él y que.
that's not really fair porque si vienen los dos al mismo tiempo your kids don't have where to stay.
exacto.
entonces my mom's like.
yeah it's kind of true.
so.
they're like.
ok let's rent an apartment.
and they were looking into apartments.
pero después mi mamá y que.
es absurdo.
we have two apartments to rent another apartment.
so they're like.
you know what?
Mariela said that she's gonna leave some time soon.
so they're waiting for her to que se vaya de la casa para que they move in.
y sabes ellos vivan en el apartamento porque el niñito vive con la abuela.
porque como el trabaja todo el día y eso.
ah mentira ah no.
everywhere they go se tiene que llevar a la niñera.
porque la niñera vive ahí con él twenty four seven entonces.
exacto.
un problema un problema.
yo no te conté lo que me pasó en en Venezuela?
ya va ya va antes de que me cuentes sabes que Miguel se casa?
sí cuando regrese de.
qué opinas?
no eso sí estoy de acuerdo.
sí?
eres la primera que me dice que está de acuerdo.
no yo sí estoy de acuerdo porque siento que mi primo ha madurado in some aspects con ella.
y siento que no es Antonio Pérez.
no sé por qué pero me da más seguridad.
no.
ok pero tú sabes la situación de ella?
no.
ella no tiene papeles.
ah.
ese es el miedo de Juana Juan de todo el mundo.
tu tío todavía no sabe.
eso no lo sabía yo.
yo pienso que no se van a casar porque yo pienso que cuando él le diga a tu tío.
tu tío le va a decir.
estás loco eres un niño.
o sea piensa bien las cosas.
o sea es una tipa de veintisiete años con un chamito de veinte.
that's kind of true.
y otra cosa o sea ella a mí me cae demasiado bien la adoro es lo máximo.
hoy la llamé y llorando conmigo y yo y que.
ay sabes tranquila sabes regresa pronto y tal.
pero yo sí siento que ella sí lo quiere.
no no sí lo.
por eso.
el mi rollo no es lo de los papeles.
sinceramente yo sí pienso ella es perro tiene veintisiete años.
yo creo que ya está lista para casarse.
porque ella se.
no claro a parte que.
sabes?
qué haría ella con un niño de de veinte años?
en realidad si de verdad no lo amara porque coño?
I'm sorry.
pero Antonio ha madurado pero no significa que esté maduro.
Mari es demasiado inmaduro pero es demasiado inmaduro.
te voy a quitar uno.
o sea no significa que que ya haya madurado.
o sea ha madurado un pelo pero no es maduro como eso.
sí.
pero.
no no no.
o sea yo lo sigo como que.
yo lo único que digo que no me parece de la relación de ellos es que Antonio es demasiado alegre demasiado tranquilo sabes o sea demasiado contento pues ahorita ahorita que finalmente ya todo le está saliendo bien.
sabes y lo que le gusta es salir y joder y sabes y pasarla bien.
y ella es full amotinada.
o sea ella es everything her way y si no se amotina.
por ejemplo el día que yo llegué el lunes.
bueno llegué a las dos de la mañana.
fuimos a casa de Juan.
estuvimos ahí.
y después nos fuimos al express Carmen Miguel y yo.
y Carmen tenía demasiado sueño.
entonces se quedó dormida en el carro.
y Miguel y yo estábamos comiendo.
él se estaba comiendo una hamburguesa y yo dos empanadas.
y estábamos comiendo así de lo más normal.
y entra Carmen.
gritó.
abre la puerta.
Miguel me voy ya que no sé que broma que estés en la casa.
y yo y que.
ok.
y yo le dijo.
danos un minuto.
sabes a a Miguel le quedaba esto de la hamburguesa.
le digo.
espérate que se termine la hamburguesa.
y vamos sabes tranquila.
pero sabes son cosas así.
y no es la primera vez pues.
ella como que es muy amotinada.
es una Sofía dos?
no.
worst.
marica.
entonces sabes como que eso no me parece porque.
no sé o sea yo sé que él está contento con ella.
pero él yo sé que no ha superado a Petra.
y Petra tampoco lo ha superado a él.
tampoco tampoco digo que esté con Petra porque ya esa relación está dañada.
ya no va nunca va a ser lo mismo.
ya.
eso es Oto y Alicia.
exacto pero sabes como que ya no sé o sea.
I don't think that she's the love of his life.
no sé.
it's too fast.
and o sea llevan dos meses.
ok te lo acepto.
been living together.
been with each other twenty four hours a day for three months.
pero oye a la vez sabes no sé siento qué es muy rápido.
no sé por qué.
y alguien le ha dicho eso a él?
Juan es el único que le dijo.
no me parece.
no estoy de acuerdo.
no sé qué broma.
y cuándo él me lo dijo a mí.
yo Juan sabía.
entonces estábamos él y yo afuera solo.
y entonces me dice.
I've good news and bad news.
y yo.
bueno.
what do you want first?
y yo le dijo.
ok the bad news.
pensaba que tenía que ver con Mariela the bad news.
entonces me dice.
I'm not gonna be single any more.
y yo.
ok you're not single any?
y entonces me dice.
but the good news is that I'm getting married.
cuando me lo dijo así.
entonces me dice.
before you say anything no me regañes.
te lo pido.
just be happy for me.
me mordí la lengua.
y dije.
ok I'm just gonna be happy for him.
no le voy a dar mi opinión nada porque he doesn't want it.
maybe porque ya le han dicho pues.
exacto exacto.
me dice.
no quiero que seas como Juan que me regañó que.
pero yo no sabía que ella no tenía papeles.
like that kind of change.
I'm not saying porque pareciera interesada or whatever.
claro.
me entiendes porque.
no porque sí lo ayer cuando estábamos en el sabes ellos salieron un momento y nos quedamos la hermana de ella ella y yo.
la chama me miró.
y se le salieron las lágrimas.
y yo y que.
no.
entonces se puso a llorar mal.
y me dice.
no voy a poder.
me dice.
no o sea no no voy a poder sin él tanto tiempo.
me dice.
sabes tengo tres meses viviendo con él.
y lo amo demasiado.
no voy a poder sin él.
pero él se va dos meses al.
y después regresa.
y regresa el el quince de junio.
y se queda?
Juan me dijo que le dan dos semanas.
and then he goes again for god knows how long.
nosotros tenemos a un amigo Adrian en el.
que él él ha venido pero no no mucho.
o sea todas las vacaciones que le dan obviamente viene para acá porque tiene la familia aquí.
él vino cuando yo estaba en Nueva York.
pero la la última vez que vino antes de eso.
ah mi primo me dijo de ese.
it was a long time ago.
qué es todo un un un negrito todo pimp.
me dijo.
es nicaragüense.
no sé porque él me dijo.
viene un amigo mío del.

fuiste a alguna parte o no?
ah.
aha.

um.
ah very nice.
was it full?
eso no está lleno?
um.
too packed?
porque yo me imaginaría que la época esa de de después de Christmas estaría que no cabe ni
bueno Jua Juana dice que ella el año pasado fue a Disney antes de Christmas y que estaba super bien porque no había nadie.
like los dos tres días antes de Christmas.
y le digo.
Juana tú estás loca?
me dice.
no no había nadie.
it was perfect.
so you never know.
right.
so eh me llamó mister um Bowers.
eh he wants you to do something for him.
you know el vecino de A one que se queja que la luz de dump slide in his backyard or something.
that we put that light shield the house light shield.
he wants you to look at the photometrics.
and see whether it's
once you put the light shield.
they are still complaining.
and they are still going to be bitching and moaning.
and aparentemente le mandó a la principal de A One un email de esos insultantes horribles whatever que le dijeron.
you know you can't communicate with her anymore.
you know one of those kind of neighbors.
so what he says they are not going to get remove of the light or anything cause they need it for safety.
but he wants to you know have time to pull evidence.
mira los photometrics con el light shield esa luz no tiene whatever.
you know it it it's acceptable.
well that's why I've been calling to Pedro para que me diga cuál es so that you know which is the pole that we put it on cause I don't know which one it is.
it's not the neighbor in the corner.
yo creo que es el de al lado.
but I need to confirm so that we know which one you put it in.
and then his other thing he noted when he was at the U One siding and connector road que pusimos luces.
you know the new road we put in.
me dice me dice esos están hasta más cerca todavía de los vecinos.
right.
so he wants to at least have some some comment from you from the photometrics saying you know the light level is is acceptable you know whatever standard that is.
I don't know how you wanna coach it you know they are not going to remove it but they wanna be able to say bueno you know it's no different than whatever your house your street light or something so
which is the pole at A One and then at U One did we run photometrics for that new connector road way?
ok so it'll be the same thing and we may have to put house shields you know home house shields on those para por lo menos quitar un poquitico porque he wants to at least show the.
mira cuando no tenía un shield este era el luz que te tocaba.
now that he has it it's a little bit lower.
go away.
all right.
thank you much anybody need anything from.

ella me dijo.
mandó un e-mail diciendo que había otra persona en la dirección en lugar de ella.
uhuh pero que estaban tratando de poner el museo como una entidad a parte no?
no.
todos los museos.
es que ellos dividen los museos.
están museo de las ciencias museo de la luz y otros dos.
debe ser un complejo muy grande.
entonces ella está viendo.
ella estaba ella estaba en la dirección de Universon.
que no no sé si en eso quiere decir que son todos.
yo creo que eso quiere decir que son todos.
está en Universon porque tú vas a la página de Universon.
y luego hay eh hay donde uno puede apachar para ver eh el el de la luz el de las ciencias las diferentes.
de las diferentes.
entonces ella está viendo si si lo separan.
y ponen todos los museos bajo de ella.
y lo que me quiso a dar a entender que la dirección general está como aglomerada.
que no sólo están los museos bajo la dirección esa sino otros.
otras cosas.
otras cosas que no son museos.
que no son museos.
entonces ella viendo que si le dan los museos a ella.
pero entonces ella tenía la dirección de todo antes.
parece.
parece que hubo.
y si le dan los museos estaría reportando a la persona que está ahora en esa posición.
no sé.
o o o le dan la otra parte.
y le dejan a ella en paz.
es que eso es una ciudad ahí adentro.
uhuh.
es la Unam.
ah todo es parte de la universidad.
todo es parte de la universidad.
por eso es que queda un poco raro la forma en que está organizado.
entonces nada pero entonces pero me dijo que no que no tenga pena que allá con mucho gusto llegan ella e Edith.

pero yo honestamente no pienso que ellos son bilingües.
en el sentido
que Antonio y y y Diego son bilingües?
no creo que son bilingües.
no.
no porque medio entender o medio leer algo no quiere decir que sean bilingües.
que la.

yo no tengo ese no es el concepto mío del bilingüalismo.
pero si nosotros grabamos todo en español qué tiene que ver con ser bilingüe?
I don't know.
I don't know.
he didn't tell me.
they didn't explain.
it might have it might have it might have something to do with the something else that has to do with an attribute of bilingual people.
that doesn't necessarily have to do with the actual language that they're speaking but.
I don't know cadence.
I don't know.
I can't imagine because I.

no déjame hablar.
que a ti no te gusta cuando yo empiezo a dar detalles y a contar y esto y el otro.
tú quieres el punto.
tú quieres que te dé las bullet points.
y que te diga esto es así.
y ya.
no es eso.
es cuando cuando quieres decir algo.
primero me dices.
se mató.
y luego empieza como fue que llegó a matarse.
no porque entonces.
ya que me dijiste que se mató.
huy chica me tienes que decir cómo se murió.
no.
y tú también eres así.
pero eso es pero eso es parte del del de la narración.
no dime no dime.
que tú vas creando como un suspenso.
para que te pongan atención porque.
no quiero no quiero el suspenso.
entonces ahora yo de ahora en adelante no se los digo.
fulano se mató porque se descalabró en la motocicleta.
ya.
y entonces yo te voy pidiendo los datos.
pero yo siento que no te va a interesar porque a veces cuando yo te cuento cosas que me interesan a mí yo te veo la cara que a ti no te interesa.
y que estás sólo escuchando sólo por educación.
no.
es que cuando comiences con Lorenzo a veces no me interesa.
pero ese es mi trabajo es parte de mi vida.
yo paso ahí nueve horas del día.
y te lo y te lo cuento porque quiero compartir algo que que hago yo durante la mayor parte de mi día que es importante para mí.
yo te lo quiero compartir.
pero.
y a ti no te interesa.
pero muchas veces a ti tampoco te interesa lo mío.
entonces después qué te voy a contar?
que vine aquí a cocinar.
que vine a lavar ropa.
que le di la comida al gato.
que.
no pero hay otras cosas por ejemplo.
número uno cuando yo te te he llevado al museo y te he mostrado un trabajo que haya hecho a veces te interesa a veces como que
si pero yo no te interrumpo cuando tú me empieces a contar cosas por ejemplo de estas.
no estoy hablando de interrumpir.
estoy hablando de interés.
o de a o de a tampoco te apuro.
aunque no me interese aunque no me interese yo no te voy a decir.
bueno y entonces y.
yeah what's the point.
como me dices tú.
tú a veces no me dejas ni siquiera contarte la historia.
tú siempre me estás apresurando.
yo sí te dejo contar historia.
no.
yo a veces pregunto.
pero tú te pones brava que yo pregunte.
porque déjame contarte déjame contarte la.
pero no es algo fuera del normal que te pregunte.
no es fuera del normal.
no pero no es que me preguntes.
es que a veces tú hasta con las manos tú haces así para que yo me apure.
porque quiero saber.
como sacándomelo con cuchara.
no.
pero no es por apurarte.
es por querer saber cómo termina la cosa.
qué tiene que porque me interesa saber cómo termina.
bueno pero entonces ten ten impaciencia porque cuando tú vas a ver una película de dos horas no estás ahí desesperado para ver cómo termina.
ah no.
por favor yo te cuento de lo que yo estoy un libro.
y estás dormida en dos minutos.
y yo no me enojo.
porque tú lees libros aburridos.
no hombre.
no son cosas muy interesantes.
no pero.
a parte es que tú me cuentes algo a las diez de la mañana a me lo cuentas a las once de la noche que ideas no aguanto más.
no estás bien.
y cuando yo empiezo a hablar se te va la onda.
no estoy bien.
porque cuando yo me acuesto en la cama ya en cinco minutos estoy del otro lado.
y eso porque está en negro ahí otra vez?
porque se quedó en negro.
y nunca lo arreglamos.
no no yo lo pinté.
no lo pintaste.
y lo que pintaste fue allá.
cuando se salió el agua del del aire condicionado se manchó allá.
pero esto es lo del baño.
yo puse Killz ahí.
tú pusiste qué?
Killz.
es un producto contra el moho.
aquí?
uhuh.
es una lata que tira para arriba.
no sé.
tal vez siguieron creciendo.
no creo que siguieron creciendo.
pero la mancha se quedó.
eso hay que pintarlo o arreglarlo.
entonces?
quiero ganarme mi plata.
hable.
dime algo.
bueno ahora tenemos que repensar qué vamos a hacer con los dos mil dólares menos que estamos recibiendo del income tax.
hay no hay no hay cuatro mil.
yo estaba esperando tres mil.
yo pensé que
yo pensé que iban a ser cuatro mil.
no el año pasado era tres mil trecientos.
este lo que vamos a hacer es pagar la tarjeta.
qué tú crees que hay que repensar?
no hay nada que repensar.
no porque habíamos pensado hacer el baño hacer el techo.
ah no eso es para pagar la tarjeta.
yo digo que hay que pagar las tarjetas.
y y aguantarse.
yo el baño lo voy haciendo según lo que pueda.
si si saco todo ahí.
compro el toilet.
y lo instalo yo.
son ciento ciento cincuenta pesos.
si lo voy haciendo yo pedazo a pedazo no nos va a salir en en en diez mil pesos con lo que piden la gente este dos mil pesos para un baño.
es la mano de obra lo que más cuesta.
acabo de ahorrar los dos mil pesos ya fue pintando yo.
nada hay que pagar las tarjetas.
digo yo.
hay que pagar todas las deudas.
si.
no quiero estar en deuda.
pero no es sólo pagar sino que dejar de gastar también.
no me ves gastando.
yo estoy aquí todos los días.
menos mañana que voy a ir a un a a ver una película en Miami Beach en.
se llama The King of.
con quién?
sólo.
no es una película.

sí voy solo.
nadie quiere ir conmigo.
yo te invitaría.
pero no.
tú dices.
ah eso es bueno eso no no.
qué voy a hacer con los niños?
es de lo que se trata.
el la primera parte del libro que leí sobre Omnivores's Dilemma.
mmhm.
es eso.
la industria del
maíz.
del maíz en este país.
y los efectos negativos.
y cómo cómo cómo la industria del maíz es equivalente a a cierta parte de la obesidad en este país.
ah hoy estaba leyendo en una noticia que salió en el periódico.
creo que del Perú.
que que para.
parece que el precio del del trigo está tan alto para hacer pan que ahora están haciendo pan de de harina de papas.
oh my god.
que rico la harina de papa.
porque sí pero sale más barato que hacer harina de trigo.
no y la y también no hubo una una un molote por el precio de las tortillas?
pero eso fue en México.
en México por eso por el maíz también.
sí pero no puedes hacer tortillas de papas.
no.
pero que te iba a ah me tienes que dar plata porque necesito pesetas.
para el meter.
mmhm.
yo te di.
que me dijo.
yo te el otro día.
el otro día.
que hiciste?
eso de café en café me lo tomo.
es es cierto.
tengo como un peso cincuenta en pesetas.
es que necesito más por si acaso.
pero ahora lo puedes pagar con la tarjeta no?
yo no voy a poner mi tarjeta.
yo lo hice una vez y no
prefiero pesetas o un peso.
en esa cosa azul tú dices?
comenzando con no sé si hay de eso ahí.
uhuh.
pero María me dijo ya dónde puedo estacionarme.
cerca de ahí yo le enseñé dónde era la puerta.
es que son dos horas no más o menos.
dice ocho y media a diez y media.
pero yo no me imagino que son dos.
bueno puede ser.
un documental de dos horas?
te voy a enseñar.
it's in the Miami Miami Cinematic Miami Beach Cinematic Cinematic se llama.
Cinematec.
ah lo voy a decir a este tipo tal vez quiere ir conmigo.
o lo dejamos ahí con los niños?
si.
no?
no.
dejaste la la la computadora ahí arriba?
sí la apagué.
ah pero este no sé si le interesa porque eso eso tiene que ver con los Estados Unidos verdad?
qué cosa?
el lo lo del maíz.
no pero si no tiene nada más que hacer tal vez.
y cuánto es que que cuesta la entrada?
diez pesos.
diez dólares por ver un documental de dos horas.
a ver qué te pasa man.
ah tú sabes qué van a dar ahí que sí quiero que que vengas conmigo?
los shorts.
los los shorts the shorts films que que nominaron para los Oscars.
casi todos son de otros países.
lo van a dar uno tras el otro.
mmhm.
son como quince veinte minutos cada uno.
y son como cuatro o cinco.
y lo van a dar ahí todo en una noche.
the the Oscar shorts.
mmhm.
creo que es el veintinueve de marzo.
you know ahora le voy a enseñar.
eso sí que quisiera.
y eso son sólo diez pesos.
y son bonitas.
yo estaba viendo los clips que dan los que pusieron los Oscars.
bonito bonito.
pero qué son?
de sobre qué?
diferentes cosas son.
cómo historias cortas?
historias cortas.
pero son muñequitos.
pero diferentes tipos de muñequitos.
la animación es completamente diferente una de la otra.
una de Rusia una de.
pero son muy bonitas.
ahí mismo en ese lugar?
en ese lugar.
voy a ver si busco un un pamphlet o algo.
y vamos.
veo cómo es la cosa.
eso sí quiero verlo también.
hay cosas que hacer en en en esta ciudad.
si uno sabe buscar.
sí no que hay que hacer.
hay que hacer.
lo que pasa es que cuando tienes niños tienes que buscar alguien que te cuida a los niños.
si no tienes alguien que te los cuide gratis tienes que pagar.
y sale caro pagarle a alguien que te cuide tus niños.
hablando de eso.
ya tenemos que mañana llamar a.
llamamos nosotros.
o dejamos que Antonio pide que es por ejemplo Antonio.
a Juanita.
si Antonio se iba a quedar con Sebastian.
y Ann también se puede quedar ahí no?
y Lilian?
donde Carlita.
entonces tiene.
o tal vez sea esa ilusión de Carla.
ellas están ellas dos estaban tramando de hace un de julio.
yo no creo que que dejen bueno.
pero lo que pasa.
pero el otro día que supuestamente el fin de semana era dormir donde Jenny por su cumpleaños la mamá dijo que no porque ella había sacado malas notas.
por eso por eso.
no es seguro con esa mujer por eso no quiero hacerlo ya.
sí.
bueno entonces tú llama a la otra entonces y a la Juanita.
para asegurar el negocio.
sí?
si.
lo llamo yo.
a ti no te dicen que no.
no me dicen que no?
no.
tú eres charming.
Juanita no me dice que no pero
Paula tampoco.
no sé no sé.
esa Paula no no me para bolas.
cómo no.
siempre es ay Noah no sé que.
jamás!
sí.
cuándo tú has visto que.
ella siempre es amable contigo.
esa paleta está de lado.
está de lado.
todas son de lado.
pero están de lado estas?
está.
no ahora no lo hagas niño.
se va.
eso está bien.
deja deja que eso va a soltar polvo.
yo lo veo más de lado.
por favor.
no va a soltar más.
yo lo limpio.
yo me paré ahí a limpiar el día que limpié toda esta casa.
qué te iba a decir?
no esa gente no me para bolas.
tal vez la Juanita porque la pobre
mal servicio sí alguno.
y me ve ahí trabajando y con los niños y eso.
le da cosa porque son mujeres.
no es cierto?
y la otra no igual.
la otra está sola igual.
pero la otra yo creo que se mueve más.
trabaja.
y tiene la mamá ahí.
debe tener quien le dé amor.
ese Mauricio no la vuelve a mirar ni a
tú le dijiste a Mauricio?
no.
no eso es un muchacho.
Mauricio tiene otro concepto completamente.
ah hablando de Mauricio estábamos mirando.
Lilian puso.
no sé dónde lo encontró.
una una página electrónica parecida a la que yo busqué en Washington para ver dónde ir a pasar el rato.
y decía ahí los lugares donde se puede ir a escuchar música latina y bailar.
estaba hoy como ayer que es que los dos queremos ir a ver cómo es.
eh Bungles que se convierte en cosa de baile después de no sé qué hora.
La Covacha.
y La Coacha.
entonces yo le dije.
bueno yo no sé la Coacha porque dice Teresa.
Covacha.
Covacha.
sí.
y yo le dije.
yo no sé pero a mí me parece que eso es para ir a buscar.
levante.
yo leí en inglés que es para hunting.
es for hunting.
que ahí va a cazar mi amigo Mauricio.
a ver si se la prestan.
a quién le dijiste eso?
a Teresa.
mmhm.
yeah.
y no sé si si Lilian me me hizo mucho caso.
y Teresa no tiene una amiga soltera?
recomendable?
para?
para Mauricio.
no lo sé.
es que yo no le puedo echar nadie a Mauricio porque después quedo mal.
mmhm.
sí cuando la le de vueltas.
y después la deja.
no.
es que él no trata de darle vueltas.
él trata de de de de ser claro.
trata en lo posible de darle impresión de que él no.
pero todas las mujeres aunque están viendo que el hombre dice.
pero cómo es que el di el dice que no quiere ningún compromiso?
mmhm.
pero en el fondo él quiere encontrar a alguien con quien compartir su vida o no?
o pretende quedarse soltero el resto de su vida?
no.
yo creo que él quiere encontrar alguien no?
yo creo que él.
no sé.
pero si comienza con que no quiere nada con nadie entonces nunca va a encontrar a nadie que vale la pena.
es que ya está.
mira Mauricio él ha siempre ha sido como de mente como de persona mayor.
de de.
y?
y ahora que ya está medio maduro peor todavía.
sí.
él está muy muy acostumbrado a lo de él.
sí pero eso no quiere decir.
él él lo que tiene que hacer es ponerse claro.
qué es lo que quiere?
quiere seguir de picaflor hasta que sea un viejo verde sólo saliendo con una.
no un viejo verde que eso es es discriminación.
bueno.
un viejo picaflor?
picaflor todo el mundo tiene derecho.
o o quiere eventualmente encontrar a alguien con quien el quiere casarse y formar una familia.
pero entonces claro que que se defina qué es lo que quiere.
no es que la primer mujer que se le va a cruzar por enfrente se va a casar con él.
y no quiere decir tampoco que a los tres meses de estar saliendo con alguien que se va a casar.
pero que tenga la mente abierta que no sale ese pánico que le da que que solamente de mencionar la palabra matrimonio se friquea.
no creo que se friquea.
yo no creo que se friquea.
pero no quiere que lo estén jodiendo.
no quiere aguantar locura.
ah bueno si no quiere que le están jodiendo que no se case.
no quiere.
por qué tú me jodes.
porque tú siempre dices que así es que yo te jodo mucho.
yo jamás te he dicho que tú.
pero lo piensas.
y yo y yo te leo la la mente.
acuérdate que yo sé leer la mente.
sí.
ajá ajá ajá.
sí.
el medium.
cómo se llama la chava esa?
mmhm medium rare.
medium rare.
cómo se llama la chava esa?
Alison.
Alison.
Alison Plaza.
mmhm.
mmhm.
seguro que.
y seguro que.
ah sí.
nombre.
choca carro.
a saber que.
porque él debe gozar de eso.
muy lindo.
pues sí han pasado.
no sé.
no vi qué hora era cuando comenzamos.
en número.
a ver.
sí.
a ver.
creo que aquí dice veintiuno.
pero no sé si se está cambiando ese número.
no sé no sé.
nunca hablamos tanto.
por eso lo que te digo que tú crees que tenemos suficiente de qué hablar para llenar treinta minutos.
pero eso no es triste?
sí es triste.
pero por qué no tenemos?
no tenemos de qué hablar.
pues porque somos feos.
o que somos.
no sé si es porque llega un punto en que
no creo que no sea que no tengamos de qué hablar.
sino que vamos seleccionando las cosas.
o deseleccionando las cosas que creemos que el otro.
por lo menos eso es lo que me pasa a mí.
que ya yo sé qué cosas que a ti no te interesan.
entonces digo yo para qué voy a hablar de eso?
para qué se lo voy a decir si es como que si se los estoy diciendo a una silla porque ni fu ni fa.
de repente me interesa?
no porque ya yo he tratado.
y no te interesa entonces para qué.
qué cosa a ver dime un ejemplo.
como cosas del trabajo por ejemplo que yo sé que en cuanto te empiezo a contar que de la convención.
o te empiezo a contar que de de del un proyecto que estoy haciendo algo así es como que se te va la atención por ahí.
y entonces mmhm mmhm.
y entonces en cualquier en en cuanto tienes la oportunidad se cambia el tema.
entonces después digo yo.
pero hay otras cosas sobre qué hablar la filosofía la política.
sí pero una no siempre está.
por eje por ejemplo yo no siempre estoy de como de humor.
para hablar de cosas así abstractas.
a veces quiero contarte de lo que me está pasando de lo que me preocupa o de lo que me emociona o de lo que me interesa.
pero tú puedes decirme eso.
sí pero si yo te empiezo a contar algo que a mí me interesa algo que me que me preocupa entonces me regañas.
sí que tú te preocupas mucho que te eso que te lo otro.
no porque todo te preocupa.
no pero todo te preocupa.
si te cuento algo que a mí me interesa por ejemplo del trabajo entonces o te pones celoso porque sí.
sólo de Lorenzo sólo de Lorenzo.
pero es que Lorenzo por allá.
y tus cubanos aquí y tus cubanos allá.
entonces como que como que se me quitan las ganas de de decirte
de hablarme de los cubanos.
no es que te esté hablando de los cubanos.
es que eso es parte de mí día a día.
sí.
entonces
mira quien apareció.
I'm sorry.
I am so full.
had lunch with my brother and my parents.
fuimos a Versailles.
mi hermano es el que vive en en Europa.
yeah, he got here on the thirtieth.
no, both him and my other brother got here after Christmas before.
niña.
right after.
no queda nada.
and nobody throws the things away.
how shameful of them.
so he'll be here until next week actually.
no.
hey yeah.
he's got like a shirt.
my brother lives in Wales.
he's got like a shirt and a jacket.
uh.
what to do.
and he is looking at me like.
you look like a balloon in a ski slope the the sunglasses the sweater the jacket.
like I don't live in the U K.
yes.
um.
dating moon or anything.
not a single comment came back from from them.
there wasn't a single comment so I can only assume that the their A they were ok with the B with they needed them so it's nice to have them.
I don't know.
we don't need him.
he is correct.
and I have told him to take them out.
and I took them out.
buy I may have taken it out of R drawing not out of W.
we don't need him.
my.
mmhm.
they are probably change those on the architectural way U and B.
but Double U had already been issued or what have you told.
it probably never got picked up.
they they aren't the the B C C.
yeah.
we can do a trade.
right right.
I don't think is that much of a.
difficult.
like Rodríguez or García.
was was striker then.
striker then ask for too much.
there is?
this is how much it is.
but you have to say this is.
right.
right right right right.
well actually what it was claimed in my emails.
I picked up a few items.
uh that he is charging for.
they let me ask you a question.
and you may have been already on W.
the Insta Hots that are down below.
he claimed that then we told them to move up a U.
is that true?
first we were never included.
they may put them down here and they were settled.
the width is for a panel.
what we had what the guy just made made a panel to cover that.
but I have a picture like Defoes.
no.
this is why they need spaces in the dressing webs.
because that's the only ones that you see.
and Defoe sent a picture and it clearly shows the Insta Hot under the sink.
but I need to go look to see what my discussion with García was in terms of what they extra money.
and I think they said that yes they had put him there and then they had to move him to the top.
and I am like wait a minute I got a picture.
I gotta figure out whether it's A or U.
I don't know which one of this.
well I mean just to check.
Miguel I saw Penélope.
at Versailles.
I had lunch with my mum and my brother.
she was there with her nephew who just came from Cuba.
sí he knows the story too already.
sí es funny.
she pulls out and she looks at me and I'm like.
oh hi!

eh y
se queda con mis papás.
y después mi otro hermano que se mudó para North Carolina.
él y la señora vinieron el veintinueve.
and they stay until the day after.
yep um.
el año pasado sí vinieron todos.

no te acuerdas que a él le le pagaron dos insurances?
te acuerdas?

y está de lo más contento porque le mandaron de eh de too much on the.
so he has got something like two hundred dollars back.
so he was all happy.
and I'm like.
he had lucky you.
me?
probably.
I've got anything yet so.
I die.
ya lo apagó?
sí porque ya no se siente tanto frío.
haven't made it over yet so.
we don't ever get it in the right sun so.
what?
where you go?
I'm heading back my way.
why?
cause it's freezing?
on hot water?
please ask me for a tea to stick in there so at least you can drink it.
it took me a couple of eh tries to drink the tea.
coño!
we're up to sixty five!
yes.
ay pero párate aquí.
no puede ser que tu seas tan enana que no puedas ver eso.
you need do you need glasses?
Annete Smith do you need reading glasses?
twenty in the.
but you just.
I just saw you do like this.
she's.
to see the.
she says you?
those heels are high.
the heel is like ten inches?
look at those things!
no no!
that's more than five.
cause I think it's what we had.
and they cannot imitate it.
what we had in the other schools.
no.
eh it was a camera.
it was a camera.
but they had to add here was a was a C C T V thing.
yeah I think so too.
one here.
that is excessive down below.
you need one more exit up here.
and you will need so many over.
and you will need so many over here.
oh I know we went through all this with with uh
the uh A and U and V.
and he may have just copied it in you know.
right.
one of the projects.
right.
but if they're not going to put any doors at all then you don't need an exit time.
it's just and opening.
why would you.
why?
because it's cold over here.
you think he's stupid?
that's fine.
I don't even think they.
did they buy any R A U and V?
I've never seen the box.
that's right.
that's right.
right.
right right.
I think that's what they did.
I think that's what they did.
I think that's what they did.
but our.
no.
right.
yeah.
I think you I think you do.
personally.
where else.
yeah well.
no he didn't.
no he didn't.
has anybody complained?
we I think he just forgot about it.
we gave him for here.
we told him that there's a way to this back here.
all schools says there were interested in this one.
they they could care less about this one.
particularly when you have a fence.
and we need to we need to make sure we have a way to fence just like we did in the U V.
a way to close this.
in other words the entrance here is a little bit different.
you know what I'm saying right?
that R A U and V we.
right.
they need to be able to to
because visitors are parking here.
and they could theoretically sneak in back here.
the layout is a little bit different here.
cause there are U and V the.
we may have those.
we may have to find we may have to find a different
mm.
for the F B O.
but.
it's better.
right.
this is where the tank is?
is it?
that's supposed to be the
this is where the tank for the the eh gas is?
so what's that?
oh they haven't updated the drawings.
ok.
ok.
I oops!
oops!
yeah, that's fine.
oh the be here.
some.
and then how would they access?
oh there'd still be a gate ok.
split it in that.
it's a good idea.
that's a good idea.
cause it at least hides it.
cause those things are uglier so.
that's a good idea.
yeah right that.
it's a good idea.
uh see.
what is this thing called again?
that's the one.
now there's water starting to stand up again.
after you haunted me for that recommendation.
and you killed my poor plant.
dígame.
oh oh.
that's a lot of water that has been used.
there is in there.
I put some water and it's coming back and starting.
wow I have no idea.
haven' gone to that point yet.
I don't know.
I think it's not edible or not for consumption or something.

pero bueno.
well maybe partially because a lot of of the boy scout leaders are.
I mean and it it sounds
and I and I'm making this up I might be.
but my theory would be it's men.
and so they think.
you know.
right right right they figure the guys are good swimmers good boaters good whatever.
you know.
right.
you know.
and then that the leaders are just as you know as forthcoming in their knowledge whereas maybe they're thinking that the women are not as.
that that's my theory you know.
they do require that you know one of our leaders must be you know certified you know that those.
most of us aren't you know.
we don't.
but.
hey Bob!
a question for you.
who's our commissioning agent for F K K A?
is it us because it's under fifty thousand?
right right right.
but then for for the prerequisite.
are we are we doing an enhance or just prerequisite for Florida Keys?
the engineer of record as long as they're not on the team.
right.
but I think if it's under fifty thousand square feet it can be done by one of the engineer's designers.
which is another presentation I went to yesterday.
it was by a company called Spinnaker Group that does
they're doing the.
right right it's a prerequisite.
well actually somebody asked that question.
and he said in theory the fundamental commissioning could be a different person than the enhance.
it usually never happens.
but he said in theory it could be two different.
agents.
well that's what what he said is that because they have something else it turns out that you end up only being able to have one.
but he said it that in theory you could have one a piece.
but because you have this other requirement then you end up with only being able to get one commissioning agent.
he said it makes no sense.
but that's kinda you know what happens.
you know that if you read them individually it could be two different teams.
but because then you have this other requirement.
I can't remember what he said.
he says you end up having to be able you know only use one.
woo hoo!
Mona did Kurt talk to you about the?
let me answer him.
colored pencils?
no they don't keep them over here.
check by Juan's desk.
no.
they check by Juan's desk or the back area.
yeah.
ask Juan who's usually the one who runs off with them.
right.
oh.
y cómo que no?
abre abre allá arriba a ver.
abre el de arriba.
just out of curiosity.
no?
I have to agree with that.
ok Marta tell me if this is too long.
for the girls yes.
actually I wanna add a section on women architecture.
but I haven't done that yet.
I made it.
now this is an Autocad drawing.
I've just traced it because your stupid girl scout website doesn't give you the ability to download a decent.
no!
and I think I can.
I I ungrouped it so I'll send it to you if you want to use it.
yeah you can see the little girls the little girls so.
I used Jane's little thing.
I might I made it la dee la dee da.
talks about mass space volume color texture.
I loosed it.
I used a lot of your things.
texture light and shadow
yep.
he he he
to to to admit it.
that was that was good that was good.
that was good.
I can't know.
we know of course we hadn't seen it because it was at your desk.
no I went backwards right.
glass stone metal
I actually moved the Sydney Opera House out of your metal because it's not metal.
you had it under metal.
it's concrete it's concrete.
marble adobe
what do you see when you see architecture
you see viewpoint
I changed some of your words because.
right.
context
we weren't doing photography
motion
you know how the intersection of the building to the sky
oh you you have two of these.
I don't know why you have two of these.
some of your images I can tell you're still learning how to use powerpoint.
framing of interior spaces details
yeah!
details
I mean I don't need to make those.
reflection
types of architecture this is architecture
, famous architec famous architecture
is this famous architecture
and same thing here I mean I can get rid of that one.
architecture is about history place time function technology materials and people.
and then because your thing had something about the history of it.
so this is early civilizations the greek and the romans the gothic the renaissance the baroque
now you guys notice what.
they may not notice.
building interior see how it changes building interior
look at the difference just in in centuries.
well this is Italian and this is German so it's not a true baroque together.
and then neoclassicism
this is the inside of uh the White House.
one of the rooms in the White House.
and this is uh Schinkel in Germany.
it's really nice.
um industrial revolution
um uh in Berlin I think.
you probably know what it is.
the art deco
and I gave them a little bit of Miami so they can recognize it.
right.
what?
I was gonna flip them yeah yeah here wait wait wait wait there where.
I can't pronounce it.
it it's Schinkel.
I don't know if it's from Berlin or not.
mmmm I think it's a church.
but I can't remember the name.
oh it may have been.
now it's a.
alright where was I?
industrial revolution the art nouveau art deco
, modernism modernism
then what is an architect.
and then I left Jane's little.
there's the plan.
and then you know since.
what it is
how you can become an architect you know.
probably a little more than they have.
but you know.
and then famous architects.
and then the next one I'm gonna put women since it's all girls.
I'm gonna I'm gonna get rid of these other ones and do women.
right right.
right.
and I already got.
tools of an architect.
again these are Jane's little pictures.
and then I show them a little bit about Autocad.
I stole it from.
it's not even Autocad.
you know Autocad doesn't have decent images to steal?
this was from like Cad or some website or some other.
ah there's the elevation.
and then you know our school.
you know so they can see a real building.
I may get rid of some of this animation.
and I can't get the animation to work but I have to ask her.
how it there it goes that's it.
that ok?
ok ok.
and then I have a thing this full of books.
I went for the ones that have pictures.
um now I I'm trying to figure out what they can do what they can do
Fred Cortez!
what is wrong with being an architect?
I don't know why people say.
I don't want to let my child be an architect.
I'm like.
no no.
yeah.
the grass is always greener on the other side.
you know if you're an attorney.
why am I an attorney?
I'd have an easier life if I didn't have to work eighty billable hours a week.
I mean there are people who say.
one day you know if I was to do something different I wouldn't do this.
but for the most I mean.
if I was to do something different it would still be design related.
ok you know graphic designer you know.
yeah but you know that's hindsight.
oh god it's it's hard.
I wouldn't be accepted in any school of architecture.
most of us wouldn't be accepted!
oh intern right.
I mean I have.
how many kids you have?
I probably have ten or twelve books.
just leave them in the car!
take them with you!
I tried to get picture books that had pictures in it just so
and actually I have a book on chairs.
so they can see design.
and I have a book on on something else
todavía tienes cookies?
qué fue?
what?
what happened what happened?
what are you looking at?
uhhuh.
what is that?
nobody sees it.
oh.
I don't know where where.
let's see where were you.
yes I was towards the end.
yeah let me put some more on female.
it was down here somewhere.
yeah you can keep some of these things over here.
right.
and you have classicism industrial revolution art deco modernism then
, what how how do you get licensed
famous architects.
and then I'm just gonna make one slide or two slides of women architecture.
tools.
this is where I was.
it was right here.
and and I I don't know how to get this animation to work.
well I'll just put it on the website.
if not I'll just dump it.
I'll put it on my laptop.
right or something like that.
when I'm done with it yeah.
I'll bring my laptop so we can.
have it work.
want me to save this into the system?
prior to me changing it.
and I'm gonna add some more women in there so
save as.
I've got a shitload of work to do.
uh image as graphics.
hmm where do you want me?
do you want me to call it?
, V one career day career day.
elevations for tile they've had them?
she's out of the office.
don't worry.
I'll answer him.
I'll be my polite usual self and say.
don't give me this excuse.
I don't wanna hear it.
because you didn't.
right.
this is probably
twenty.
this is a Cad color presentation.
but why would it be Cad color?
that's right.
this is the cameras.
that stupid cramer shit.
eh yeah it's not um no.
I mean well actually it should be.
because because the owner only gave us one freaking copy.
took us what fifteen months to get it.
and well fifteen months is an exaggeration.
but you get the point.
uh so it was the copies for the owner copies for the contractor copies for us copy for mechanical so it.
the the the C C T V the security cameras coordination.
right.
right.
contractor.
and they were.
right this was the one from prices so they needed copies.
so it should be reimbursable.
we should charge em for that one.
qué más tienes?
oh that's nice.
looks good!
yes my favorite he's awesome.
he could draw.
Josef Hoffmann couldn't draw.
but he could draw.
we went to when I was in Europe to um the Paris.
one of the first exhibits that they had of of the modernism.
you know early modernism art nouveau art deco you know secession.
nineteen hundred Paris called nineteen hundred.
and it was in Paris in the Pompidou.
this was twenty years.
it was like a comprehensive exhibit of that earlier and the precursor to the modernism.
and um they had a whole section on the secession.
you know Otto Wagner Josef Hoffmann.
and you know he did a lot of work.
he couldn't draw if his life depended on it.
yeah his sketches were like.
and my best fried goes.
oh there's hope for me yet!
if he can draw!
you know and then Otto Wagner's drawings were just like ahhh you know.
but Hoffmann's he's the one who.
he's the one that did all those beautiful round buildings.
you know he wasn't he was a little bit less busy than than than Wagner.
she but he couldn't.
I mean and he did like restaurants.
and he even did.
he had sketches for the menu for the for the silverware the flatware the furniture.
I mean it was a comprehensive like it used to be but he couldn't draw worth a damn.
you know they were like you know fifth grader drawings.
draw by hand?
ah yes I have.
he still follows the old fashioned.
he's just the the Prit he's just got an award the Pritzker I think he's just had the Pritzker.
Santiago Calatrava.
Calatrava still draws like that.
oh really?
I didn't know that either.
well Calatrava's like that.
he draws.
you weren't here.
well you were downstairs when I came back from the Las Vegas.
five.
he was the gold medalist for the A I A national convention about three years ago.
so he was the speaker.
usually the gold medalist they try to have them you know speak at one of the sessions on Saturday.
and you know it's he he pulls out.
you know he starts talking about you know.
and actually he's a really really humble person.
you know how some of these people they're just like.
he was so honored to have gotten it that.
you know he was like in awe that all these people thought his work was really good.
that he.
I think he has an office in New York or he's living and he said that you know the Americans are.
so I mean he was.
I mean I was like oh my god this is a real person!
you know.
tsk and so he starts talking about the design ideas.
and how he uh.
like the the Milwaukee art museum you know how.
and he starts to draw with watercolors.
you know they had the overhead projector.
five thousand people the it's projecting you know half this room.
and he's just and he's just.
and I'm going.
oh my god.
I mean.
not only that not only that it's like.
he wasn't in.
I mean he was nervous speaking.
you could tell he was nervous speaking.
you know which was kinda like endearing.
because you know you could tell he was like.
oh my god.
but the minute he started drawing and talking about the ideas as he drew the nervousness was gone.
I mean he was in his element.
this was his passion.
and he's just drawing.
and I'm thinking.
and you're not nervous drawing in front of five thousand architects?
you know you're my hero buddy you know.
you know it the good his work uh I have a book downstairs of his stuff that I bought.
because he's an engineer as well.
he was he he was really good.
um.
um.
right.
no the boy boy scouts is just as tough as the girl scouts.
the thing is I I would argue I would I s I would venture to suggest that many of the troops do things they just don't tell the council they're doing.
does that make sense?
right in our case because we're through the the the the church then you know it's not you personal.
you know we we we have the the church.
we do make them sign a release a a permission slip when we go anywhere.
and half the kids don't give it to me.
and I scream and bitch at them.
and they're going to camping this next weekend at Peace River which is a river up um.
that you one of those where they drop you at one end.
and and with the canoe you canoe.
it's like twenty three miles down uh north of of Fort Myers or one of those places.
and I told the kids.
ok this isn't like we're camping around the corner where your parents can come get you.
if I don't have a permission slip you are not going.
I don't care how old you are.
I don't care if you're a senior in high school.
you are not going.
they're like.
ok Maria ok ok!
because they'd get lax.
they've gotten used to to four of the kids with s giving permission slip because it was the camping was down the street.
and mom and dad were going.
I just said.
I don't care if your parents are going or not.
I want a permission slip.
right but in this case we are going out of town.
we are going on a very rustic.
I mean you have to camp with you bring what you got.
and you take out what you brought.
Peace River.
no.
hello I I gave em
I said.
we're not around the corner.
I want a permission slip.
and I said.
from now on anytime we go anywhere and it's camping you all have a permission slip none of you are going!
it's like coño!
porque es una mala crianza.
all of them have gotten away with it for years.
and they think they'll just keep doing it.
yeah we have that too.
oh but they don't give you one they don't give you one?
see the back of the application form says the name gets sent to the council has all the medical history on the back.
and we keep it on file.
ok Henry had a little too many things to.
when he was growing up.
alright.
but why we certainly understand the challenges of finishes this project within the scheduled
time frame.
time frame.
but I find it difficult to believe that all the kitchen equipment that must be manufactured in several finished panels will delay production.
but in the.
in interest of fairness we are not the production company.
in the future please contact our office immediately.
by phone if necessary to get the required information.
our school staff includes Jane Nick Cathy Wendy Adam and I.
therefore one of us one of us is likely to have the answer immediately.
I already said immediately.
instant instant.
instantly.
oh I forgot Bob Bob.
I didn't say anything
I know and we have to respond we have to respond.
of delay.
yeah and we certainly done all.
but in the interest of fairness we're not the production company.
in the future please contact our office immediately.
by phone together with our our school staff um um um.
therefore one of us is likely to have the answer instantly.
answer.
thank you!
I promise he's copied everybody and their mother so you have to answer it.
I was being polite.
I was being polite.
Jane's mine I'll just put Carl in here just because Carl can curtail his.
mmhm.
he sure did.
he sure did.
alright where's your other one now.
I I don't even feel like writing.
yeah they might wanna read it.
let's see tsk.
when were we were out there?
we were out there on a Monday.
March twenty-fourth.
back.
Jane.
I haven't even read it.
I'm answering without reading.
I will read it.
and.
I were out.
no we weren't out there on three twenty-five we were on three twenty-four.
we were out on site to review texture mockup on three twenty-five twenty-four tsk.
we did mention the requirement of color approval.
because a paint chip is never the same as the real thing with sun and materials
as part of the mixture.
do we need a a mockup for the inside?
just so you understand our interest in the exterior color mockup at A U A U V.
the original colors we selected did not turn out like we thought.
and therefore had to select different colors.
we do not want to come out to
to know when we can come and review colors.
are you sure we?
I don't think we did interior.
do we need them?
let's go ahead and look at it.
because some of the interiors at A U V I would have lived without of happily.
like that that um bonafide beige.
you can't see it!
you can't.
ok.
he cancelled?
ok.
just so you understand our interest in exterior colors.
the mockup at A U V did not turn out like we thought and.
we are positive that.
eh I'm just trying to give it a positive spin here.
that.
all of us working together will result in a successful project delivered on time.
how's that?
um I am told that the paint sample for every everyday white did not match the intended color.
and we ask for resubmittal.
I'm leaving a little early but
uh one thirty Tim Washington's coming here.
to review.
I'm just signing a pay out.
do we need to say anything else?
it did not match the intended color correct?
it's not a new color?
it is not a new color.
what did they just didn't paint it correctly or didn't look right?
but do we know.
oh because they're not using the same.
ah it is not a color.
it is simply a simply a different manufac a different shade by a different manufac different shade by a different manufacturer.
hence the painting sub needs to match the basis of design.
how's that?
you wanna put something yes.
what did you want me how did you want me to answer that?
oops.
what was missing?
uhhuh.
uhhuh.
uhhuh.
ok let me ask you a stupid question.
why did we took why did we took so long to give it back to them?
I thought we picked the colors a long long time ago.
so why are they saying they just got it this week?
but we discovered that it wasn't right weeks ago!
no it was more than that.
longer than two weeks.
longer than last week.
I thought it was longer than that.
well then let's leave it alone.
because we.
mmhm.
you would've had it.
so what you're telling me this.
updated.
but we've selected those colors a long time ago.
why had we never updated this?
and we still didn't read our A S I?
no no I'll tell you what happened.
this is a legend being xrefed from a different file.
she fixed the legend at W.
but it was still xrefing at non W.
I bet that's what happened.
bet you a million dollars.
because I have found plenty legends that refers to not it it's own W folder but back to the original.
back to the original uh.
do you see what I'm saying?
because there's no way.
there is no technology.
then it's referring to the wrong folder.
no no no but I'm saying it's.
she changed this.
you know she changed it two days before.
when that new drawing was opened.
I did guarantee you it's that that it was referring to
well then then I go back to my usual statement.
people need to look at these things before they're released.
because they've not looked they've not looked.
because if I know I've changed a legend.
because I know when I change a legend and I go back to the drawing I look to make sure that it's uploaded it.
and when I haven't did when I've discovered that it's not then I change the legend.
and it doesn't.
and I'll go.
who the hell?
and then I go in the xref.
and it's referring the same folder name but under a different project.
then we then we do need to bring it in.
that's ok.
we just.
we just need to we just need to make sure that staff realizes when you update a legend make sure it's referring to the folder it's supposed to.
because when you stole that legend from another folder a lot of times we forget.
you know what I'm saying?
particularly because we borrowed all these drawings.
so we may have plain and simply forgotten to change the paths.
it was a different path.
leave it alone leave it alone cause that means we really screwed up.
I'm not gonna win so.
and I'm not gonna win.
not gonna win that one.
so I'm gonna let them have it.
so what's his problem on this northeast person?
make him worth his while right?
what'd they do?
they.
oh they definitely definitely.
because we pick on each other for work quite never that uh.
we're never on the cruel.
we we stop beyond getting too cruel.
then I perhaps mister Alvaro Rodriguez was not off the market at all.
so yo le digo a la waitress.
eh hay lugar adentro en la barra?
uhuh.
said.
well if a if a table opens up or something opens up I'll let you know ok?
so a few minutes later she tells us that there's a table at the bar.
so we went at the bar
in time-out there in a corner.
you're ok there?
ya estamos dentro que.
well so we were there
and a couple of guys turned to talk to us.
and well but nothing.
and while we were there sitting and sitting and sitting
y nada pasó.
and drinking and sitting.
ni modo se emborrachaban antes de que le pasara.

entonces le digo.

lo que estaba diciendo el hombre
después de cierta edad I don't think we should do anything.
I know.
too weird too much or too weird.
yeah.
you know what I mean?
yeah.
to be perfectly honest with you Flavia I'm happy with myself.
no me too.
and I don't know well it's a little.
I always say that I I will need to grow old and
s s.
Sean me estaba diciendo que le estaba he he was making fun of Curtis
quién?
Sean.
uhuh.
er por la nariz porque va a ser narigón.
ah mija es narigón también.
si salga.
si sale a él o si sale a su familia o a mí va a salir narigón.
cualquiera de los dos.
cualquiera de los dos.
yeah.
so er he was.
ah he shouldn't have said anything.
I was.
what but he's.
hmm?
he shouldn't have said anything because he is gonna be thinking.
no but I was telling him.
I was never.
I was I mean yo tengo una buena nariz.
sí pero.
but I mean una buena manija.
but you know what?
but but I always
for your face.
it's big.
no it looks good on your face.
but it's no.
because you because you're a sweetheart.
no no no no porque me quedaría callada entonces.
pero.
oh really.
no.
ay sí.
no but it never bothered me.
why am I gonna if it did didn't do it when I was in my twenties why am I gonna do it now?
sí.
no.
no.
pero.
lo pero es que pero lo malo es lo que cre lo que sigue creciendo cuando una envejece the the nose and the ears!
claro y las orejas!
I know.
I was worried about that.
they never stop growing.
eso sí.
las orejas nunca paran de crecer.
nunca paran de crecer.
I know.
que esa parte sí me tiene preocupada.
el otro día I was thinking about that.
said.
ahh should I do something about my nose?
am I gonna look like an ugly old lady?
I thought about that because it's getting a little more carnoso aquí.
I was thinking the same thing the other day.
it's like.
but I'm afraid.
I don't wanna do anything like that.
because what if I get worse than now.
I'm afraid.
porque cuando ves a esta gente que tienes plastic surgery they really look ridiculous.
something happens here you know
, like you see if you go like this wh what happens to the lip.
you see?
it's true yeah.
if you go like that
no and if I and if you go
porque esto también.
pero if you go like that they've got to do the lip again.
so whatever you do
yeah s se le nota.
it's not.
se sí se deforma la cara.
el otro día sí I was watching T V the news en español
, y esta mujer que se llama Edna Smichtz Edna Smif Ed Ed Edna algo en Univisión
y entonces dijo.
soy Edna Smith
y digo yo.
y dónde?
y esa no es
o sea nada que ver with the person I had seen before.
yeah.
well I was looking there was I was watching a magazine once.
y estaba uh Robert Redford
ah Robert Redford se ve uh el mismo
er.
él no se ha hecho nada o sí?
no sí.
ah se ha hecho cirugías?
bueno y estaban poniendo fotos antes y después.
ok.
i it was like a poll no?
que se cual que que se ven mejor antes o después de la cirugía.
ok.
y todos se veían mejor antes.
ahhah.
you know.
ay sí.
so you never know.
sí no yo creo que uno tiene que envejecer con dignidad.
yeah I agree I agree.
sí porque.
porque es que te estás engañando a ti misma y al esposo.
bueno el esposo qué importa.
bueno sí qué importa lo que él piense
no but.
no pero.
we don't care any more.
no after so many years.
pero er I don't know.
no sé.
I think that you have to be happy with yourself really after all.
sí I learned that.
pero como le decía a mi marido si si no lo hi hice cuando tenía veinte años que vo lo voy a hacerlo ahora tampoco.
no no cuando tengas veinticinco treinta.
pero después ya como que uno se.
I mean nothing wrong with doing that.
no!
it's just.
I don't know
but it's it's not
like a priority.
I don't know.
at this point things change.
because I think that if it's going to create like a psychological thing.
you know you know if you are really so unhappy that well fine.
sí exacto si te sientes bien mal
pero si es más o menos si estás.
o se hace por vanidad o por
o que te sientes que no te ves tan bien pero.
bueno pero Ronnie es una má Ronnie no para.
cu qué se ha hecho?
se hizo.
Ronnie se había hecho los senos cuando era joven bueno
el busto.
bueno yo la conocí.

pero se le habían encapsulado
y se tuvo que hacer otra vez.
ahora le tocó.

Mick invited us no not Fiona.
Mick did.
Mick did not not
well started an hour ago.
we we went from one thing to another.
no sé de qué estábamos hablando.
de qué estábamos hablando?
de las clases del gimnasio.
aw.
no I er saw Trishia today
and she said.
oh I haven't seen you.
I said.
yeah I haven't been here in a long time.
because I was outside
you know they were doing that.
oh the the garage yeah.
like a flea market thing.
like a garage sale or something.
uhuh.
sí no I was.
toys and stuff.
yeah exactly.
and I said to her.
you know what I I really like it
Trishia es la muchacha que vendía.
Trishia's the owner.
tsk oh ok yeah.
we recently met
and she said.
hey I'll give you a good.
good deal.
sí.
ven
y yo te ayudo
y te entreno por un tiempito.
y yo le dije.
ok.
it's twenty five dollars a month.
well they had a better deal then that.
sí?
why?
because when when I when I signed up it was hundred and sixteen for the whole year.
I know.
no no it's three hundred and something.
yeah.
y lo tuvieron ese er por bastante tiempo?
sí no I'm gonna wait then.
that's why.
or I'm gonna talk to her.
or just just tell her yeah.
yeah I'm gonna say.
porque oh sí hey.
hey give me.
because I was there for so long.
and then.
yeah.
and and everybody else signed up for that deal.
exacto.
lo único que después te cobran una cosa por aquí y otra cosa por allá.
como veinticinco dólares sí.
that that I don't like because it's not.
pero cada cuánto?
how how often do they do that like twice a year right?
because sometimes at home I get those bills for you know for Ted.
I don't know because porque um
yeah because er the contract is let's say X amount of money.
uhuh.
one sixty let's say.
sixty nine I think it was.
no er whatever.
y después te ponen processing fee esto
la letra chiquita.
veinte dólares.
sí hmm first month whatever er
treinta dólares.
pena es.
, y ahí después te pongo otros cien en en en small print that you aren't que tú no lo
que tú no sabes ni qué es.
entonces terminas pagando trescientos.
so.
no doscientos en de vez de ciento diez como serían ciento sesenta una cosa así.
um yeah.
yeah but in anyway it's a good deal.
it is half of.
sí.
but they got all the people that were going to Lady of America
los trajeron because como cerraron
I know.
and now happens that there are too many people.
they have too many people?
that they can't no dan abasto.
so the machines are always occupied.
busy um.
yeah.
and the classes are always full.
really?
which isn't cool in some.
um.
and I think the the the quality of the classes improve.
yes because before they were kinda like empty.
pero.
yeah.
and then they didn't have enough people teaching.
and now and the the instructors improve too.
really?
because they didn't have good people before.
yeah.
no ahora son buenos.
sí?
yeah er today er la clase que fui hoy.
a qué horas?
a a las nueve y media.
I I scheduled to stay for two classes because I normally can do that
y hmm chica qué oh.
hoy no.
hoy saliste de.
me lo has dicho.
no podía terminar una.
no podía del.
de qué era?
aerobics o cosa.
I hate aerobics.
it's it's aerobics y body-sculpting.
I love sculpting.
sí.
that's my favourite thing.
but it's like step.
I hate aerobics.
the the first half is step aerobics
and then it's a.
who's giving that class?
Marian.
Marian she was in Platinum before
ok.
y ahora es el manager aquí.
but they're gonna build another building.
right they're gonna do another building?
what are they doing?
what I its.
because they're gonna.
what are they doing I don't know.
they were going to well.
last time I I heard
, they were they sold all that property.
yeah everything they.
and they are going to build the Hilton.
an upscale Hilton or or.
Marriott.
the Marriott yeah.
um.
one of those that's gonna happen.
but on the left or where the gym is.
tsk everywhere because they are going to do a hotel and time-share property.
time-share apartments.
but that's good for us isn't it?
yeah it is good for us.
it is good for us.
y el spa va a ser parte del hotel.
I mean el spa and gym is gonna be part of the hotel.
part of the hotel.
not.
inside of the hotel?
it will be most likely.
Sean we are recording here.
aw don't be mean.
aw ok the gym is gonna be inside like.
it's not gonna be like right now just the gym and the spa.
yeah because what they are doing.
yeah what they're doing trying to do is a resort a complete resort with the golf course and the spa.
but they're gonna be the same owners?
like Trishia and Dan?
tsk no so.
no they didn't they are not renewing the contract.
I I heard from someone else that the own Pat Segal the Seegal the owner he is not renewing them the contract for next year.
Seegal.
so be careful to what you sign.
aw it's true.
because maybe.
so where are they gonna go?
I don't know.
but after a day deep down I don't understand how that works.
well I think that they run the building.
they're renting that?
porque te acuerdas.
o sea ellos tienen ese lugar porque ellos fueron los que lo construyeron.
yo pensé que eso era lo que ellos habían hecho.
Dan and Trishia habían construido ese edificio.
el papá le ha regalado eso a Trishia.
eso fue lo que yo entendí.
I don't know.
entonces cómo hacen cómo es el negocio?
who knows.
I I was under the understanding that they rent that from Pat Seegal.
tsk is it?
I don't know.
probably just the property probably.
and then that's why they can take that thing down and.
porque.
no n no puede ser que lo haya construido Trishia.
no?
sabes because yeah they started managing it
, but Pat but I remember that Pat Seegal they were going to do that gym with someone else before.
and the.
al prin principio al prin.
yeah and the deal fell
te acuerdas cuando ese muchacho?
y después lo hicieron con Lisa.
sí me acuerdo huh era el gridiron.
I don't remember.
gridiron bueno yo no sé ni como se llama.
but I remember there was.
so I don't think that.
I think that maybe the the building of the er of the building construir el edificio it was part of the deal I guess.
gridiron gridiron.
uhuh.
ok.
y Dan and Trishia empezaron a.
that is not bad for them.
tú sabes que yo no creí que yo creía que Trishia era la mamá de de Dan.
oh no no.
y ahí un viejo ahí y hay un viejo de canoso that it was that guy was the owner
because she looks older.
and I thought that Trishia was.
no ese es el papá de ella.
el la dueña es ella.
oh my god!
ese viejo es el papá?
el señor es el papá de ella.
because he looks like owner.
ese no ella es la dueña.
él le regaló eso a ella.

yes sí sí los he visto.
yeah that's her father.
pero.
they look just alike.
but they he doesn't look that he's that much older to be her father.

or she looks much older than she is.
I think she just looks older than she is.
she's younger than me.
oh no she looks much older.
but Dan Dan is really young looking.

they're not gonna know what's missing!
what all of this?
oh oh oh but don't you have ours yours yours are here right?
oh so they're short.

but but
but but let let me ask you.
they were using our owner's copies for them?
right.
but we we didn't keep the owner's copy?
right.
but it was pilfered.
because that said V was pilfered.
you and V and A were not pilfered.
that's why I have unboxed one.
I mean not like big-time pilfered but.
right.
I know for a fact ours was pilfered because Joe and Matt said sometimes when they couldn't find their copy they knew we had a copy.
they come and get it.
but on on your case it's different.
at V One the trailer was so small that Matt and Joe were working in the same room as the conference room the you know.
right.
things disappearing.
exactly exactly.
so I'll I'll that's why I know some of the stuff is missing.
but you know what?
for the most part it's all there so I'm not gonna worry about it.
good enough for me.
when I arrive with all the stuff it's gonna take them three months to figure out what's missing.
our Salford?

I think he's working with Robert.
he's probably Robert Howitt.
right.
yeah.
Robert is pretty good because he sees things.
I no longer see them.
right he's new.
then it was their stuff that it bothers you.
and it's the first time you see it.
then.
it's gonna bother everybody.
but but it's something you have to look for.
and if it really doesn't bother you then nobody is going to see it.
April first.
supposedly.
uhhuh.
huh?
that's true.
or.
uhhuh.
uhhuh.
mija no está tan bonita be be it's all mixed up but.
it's funny.
uhhuh.
uh.
avocados that way like?
it needs to be something.
like in a salad or cooked.
like
you can make like a curry you know with.
se lo echas a lo último porque se pone suavecito.
it's pretty good isn't it?
uhhuh.
coge más because there's plenty.

uhhuh.
y Dora tiene el digo tsk Alex tiene el bedspread de Dora.

uhhuh.
nine.
or by the time I move them in there you know he'll be like let's see when Sam graduate from school he'll be like on the third or fourth grade fourth grade.
uhhuh.
so he's gonna be three he'll be nine so he'll be in the fourth or fifth grade.
tsk right.
so you know I may just move them in there.
still leave a bed for when Sam comes home.
ay or on spring break or you know.
holidays and stuff.
right.
first Alex and I appreciate that she keeps the smaller room.
and her brother keeps the bigger room.
because they're not the same size.
they have the smallest room the two of them.
because when we moved in there Sam took the bigger room because he had you know more furniture than toys.
and Alex that was gonna be just his room.
right.
right.
and so the office so that room is the f smallest bedroom.
the office is actually bigger.
but I have too much stuff to sacrifice my office.
that's why I give them away.
it's why I give them away.
coge más.

sí los avocados están caros.
all those people come in and back in.
it's easier to get out.

ah a mí se me olvidó ayer que we were supposed to go out to W yesterday to check out the texture.
and I went.
argh I drove the van the back of the the van has a
but.
yeah because when I started driving the other one.
uhhuh.
uhhuh.

because my dad never do any maintenance on it.
oh ah he chan él le cambiaba el aceite y eso.
qué es eso?
cuánto gastaste?
how much you spent?
for what?
oh this is what you ordered yesterday?
it should be in in your bill I guess eats from a package.
uh.
you've realised we're having duck.
is that a return?
coño that's pretty lame!
that looks really bad!
tight little clothes.
I've said I've said that to Claudia.
it's freezing!
you know what?
if you wore long-sleeved shirts.
you've started them where?
amazing what happens if you wore shirts huh?
you wouldn't be.
actually it is a bit chilly right now.
I'm about to put my sweater on.
right.
my husband I woke they'll I'll was it a couple of weeks ago that it was really nice and windy I convinced him to open the windows and open the doors in our bedroom to sleep at night with the windows.
I mean we've got two monster dogs.
of course they welcome you.
hello come in!
you know.
hello they can come in through the freaking.
you know Randy goes.
how did you do that?
I go.
Randy my back doors are never locked.
they can probably walk right in.
and even if they're locked they can walk through the doggy door which is as big as a person.
you know it's like.
so so we slept.
it was really nice!
it was really really windy.
last night I wake up I went to bed before he did.
I wake up this morning.
and one of the doors Jimmy had opened both and the windows cause cause it was cooler.
and I was like.
honey what happened?
you opened.
he goes.
free cooling.
th the house was sixty-eight degrees inside!
the front door?
you didn't lock it.
it was wide open.
or that your dog didn't run out.
he could have ran out.
so sí hay un range ahí.
mmhm.
donde los policías practican.
y y la gente que están los trainees the police trainees.
they do it every day.
so when you come here don't be afraid if you hear it.
because you know they're practicing.
yeah yeah they have to put these earphones.
porque si no se puede quedar uno sordo.
really?
pero aquí no se oye mucho.
absolutely se puede quedar uno sordo.
when.
cuando yo estoy entrando aquí sometimes I hear it.
but it's not so loud because the range is all the way over there.
yeah.
which is great.
I imagine if we were right there that would be a problem.
yeah.
but there's a lot of distance.
so I don't think it's a problem.
no no no it's not a problem.
pero if you do it every day you you suppose to you know for protection.
that's a good idea.
yeah.
but they have like like little dummies.
yeah.
and I think you're supposed to like target them or something.
that is the target right?
yeah.
yeah I used to do that.
entonces si caminas un poco más if you walk a little further you'll see they're building and like an exercise path for the police officials or police trainees actually.
entonces tienes que brincar tienes que ir.
obstacle courses.
sí exactamente.
oh my god.
entonces lo tienen ahí entonces there's a lot of construction going around here.
so I asked what was happening.
and they said that the the the corrections is coming and also F B I.
oh my goodness so we're expanding.
exactly.
qué bueno.
es bueno tener un lugar donde uno pueda crecer porque digamos ahora estás aquí.
pero mañana puedes estar en otra posición.
exacto uno nunca sabe.
y todas las chicas aquí son bien inteligentes.
sí.
they're very smart.
and they all have background in what they do which is broadcasting videos.
wow.
and like actually recording.
and editing and all that stuff.
and it's gonna be great trying to learn from them because they're all experts.
so I'm kind of looking forward to doing that.
always learn from the experts.
exactly.
you can always become good yourself.
well yeah they're good trainers.
so I I have faith that I'll be able to do it eventually.
y entonces allá entonces en el en el edificio cien.
está la command staff.
ahí está el lieutenant.
ahí está el major.
so for instance I report to the lieutenant.
and the whole place reports to the major.
they report to different people.
right.
but he's the one in charge ultimately.
aquí hay una muchacha que se llama Ana que she's very sweet.
y entonces está encinta.
oh.
y y no va poder venir she's not gonna be able to come in for another seven months.
but everybody reports to her.
but I I report to the to the lieutenant which is in the command staff.
she's so beautiful.
she's very young.
una muchacha bien joven bien bonita.
y muy capacitada.
gracias a dios que dios la bendiga.
exacto.
because you know being a mother is no easy task.
no that I know.
but it's the best that anybody could experience in life.
well you you have a lot of experience being a.
you reared us all.
yeah.
you had six of us.
and you put us all through school.
a mí me ayudaste increíblemente.
I probably could never have done anything without you.
thank you sis.
you're welcome mamita.
and now you're putting Carmencita my daughter through school which is not an easy task either.
and your children too.
I tell you I think that now is is difficult.
it's very difficult nowadays porque es que la calle está mala.
no todo está malo.
las muchachas no saben portarse bien porque las muchachas hoy en día it's a problem.
exactamente.
huh.
y.
yo no entiendo a estas muchachas hoy en día.
and my daughter now is using you know.
I got her the phone as a protection when she goes to school whatever she has to call but they're text messaging.
yeah now they don't even have to use your minutes.
es todo es text message.
exacto.
yo yo te digo la verdad que ahora vamos a tener que hacer algo para saber qué es lo que está hablando en ese text message.
I'm looking yo lo yo lo miro.
sí?
I have to check my son you know.
you haven't checked at all?
yo no.
no.
so when do you plan to?
no I'm gonna ask Ivan to do it for me porque.
you porque tú no lo puedes hacer you can't go to it and start checking this?
es que he is such a an advanced technologically advanced.
his his phone.
yeah y yo no sé ni cómo prenderlo.
porque el teléfono mío tú sabes.
no pero el tuyo sí sabe.
tú sabes bastante de eso.
aunque no lo creas tú entiendes bastante.
pero yo como nunca me interesé en eso de text message yo ahora a quién voy a hablarle?
bueno tú tienes mucha gente que te quiere.
en text message.
sí pero.
but it takes time it's very tedious.
yeah.
y entonces están usando los dedos.
eso de los dedos va a dar artritis.
todo el día en eso oh my god.
fíjate que en mi teléfono tanto que yo marco que ya se me está acabando en en the face of my phone.
really?
it's it's already smeared.
entonces el problema es que.
see look the number eight it's like it's all messed up.
y entonces en qué letra entonces cuando uno tiene que marcar la letra uno no sabe.
pero los niños hoy en día they memorize it.
Carmencita is really fast.
que que number seven is a I don't know I G T whatever.
Carmencita is so fast on that on that email or the text messaging on her phone.
she'll answer faster to a text message than to answer her phone.
I think so.
I'm serious.
and they do this all day so now.
and was telling me that since she is so close to that phone that another way to get to her so she behaves is say to her.
you know if you if you miss behave.
because you know she has a tendency with her friends and everythings.
then what they're gonna take the phone away when you get name from school you can't text message.
and then then she says how quickly she's gonna be behave cause she wants to do it.
you know I wish that that would be a solution to the problem
but it's a a at least it's a suggestion.
you know taking away.
but what do you say?
you know the the the.
you you have psychology.
what wha what's the best way?
my philosophy is totally different that.
I believe in you know look for something that she's doing right.
and reward her.
yeah but what about the stuff that she's doing negative?
some how.
how do you take that away?
you have to find a way to to either overlook it.
and then reframe the whole circumstances.
tienes que buscale la onda porque es que toda la gente en psicología sabe que que eso no trabaja
bueno por ejemplo.
taking away taking away taking away
por ejemplo hace dos días ella estaba bien bien grosera.
she was extremely nasty.
that's not good.
so we're gonna punish her this weekend.
she can't go out.
she she could go out.
but she can't be with her friends which is that's a real punishment.
you know puede ser.
yeah that that to me that kind of punishment is like when you have finished all your recourses.
to be with her friends not.
to reframe the circumstances.
you've gotta find ways that she would wanna do it voluntarily to behave.
to to get her clothing out.
er finding ways.
well I think the fact that she wants to be with her friends every weekend.
and I'm not letting her do it this weekend because she didn't behave.
I don't think she'll be nasty again.
I think that she will be.
you do?
ok let's try.
let's use it as a as a test.
try it try it.
try it.
I mean some times you have to use that kind of um
training.
you know training yeah.
a a lo mejor trabajo contigo.
pero yo trato yo trato lo máximo de no usar esa técnica.
so que tú dame un ejemplo.
vamos a suponer que tu hijo te contesta mal.
no.
qué tú haces?
well many times I give him the silent treatment.
for how long tú no le hablas?
bueno no I give him the silent treatment.
and he he never gets the silent treatment porque se porta bien
pero cuánto?
un minuto día o hora?
no.
instantáneamente ya él sabe que yo estoy disgustada.
and he'll ask me.
are you mad at me?
I say.
yeah I am.
what do you expect?
you want me to have a smile on my face?
mmhm.
but we have a very good communication thank god.
and he knows that I'll you know do whatever I can to support him.
yeah but like if he but if he answers you nasty.
and he goes into his room.
I say you know.
is that necessary?
I say.
is that necessary?
we we in this household believe in respect.
and we try to work it out.
hablando se entiende la gente.
claro.
pero hasta ahora because él nada más tiene que quince añitos va para dieciséis next month.
a hundred and twenty god willing.
dios se lo bendiga.
thank you.
and you know they go through some kind of osmosis when they hit sixteen.
sixteen seventeen.
so you know he said to me the other day.
oh you know mother.
you're the greatest.
that was nice.
yeah.
que te dijo eso.
yeah.
él siempre me da cumplidos así.
so I said to him.
talk to me in two more years.
because you plan to what?
well because they go through this osmosis.
bring in the rains.
then hey wha what happened to the to most kids?
exactly.
no I'm praying that it won't happen to my kid.
I mean.
my oldest son went through a a little bit once he got to the point que estaba dating.
uhuh.
and a that seems to be a problem.
pero yo I don't remember Armand dating except Muni.
yeah.
did he when he went away you didn't see him.
no no he was a he went to Europe.
pero a quién más he dated here.
aquí nunca salió con nadie.
yeah he used to have some friends.
he did?
yeah.
but the the point to be made is thank god que era serio.
mmhm.
y con todo y eso he was problematic.
staying up late sixteen seventeen.
and he went to religious school.
yeah ahora Carmencita likes to stay up late too.
but she's like on the computer.
or watching T V.
that's ok.
it's kid stuff.
you know you know weekends whatever.
and during the week también yo últimamente la estoy acostando más temprano.
pero no es fácil because she doesn't wanna go to sleep.
and her friends are text messaging her.
well I would say you know comes nine o'clock nine thirty because she is only eleven.
so nine thirty is the latest.
the phone gets shut off.
the lights go off.
the Tv goes off.
and everybody goes into the sac.
it's time to go to sleep.
I think that if you program kids like that early in life like my son right now.
he automatically can he can't stay up.
está cansado.
está cansado.
for example now que he's into football.
cómo estaba en eso he plays everyday football?
everyday they do training at six in the morning.
so it's a football team for the school?
yeah.
wow that's interesting.
it's the first one in the nation.
really?
from a religious school.
wow so that's good that he's part of it.
he's thrilled.
and.
so what position is he in now?
I don't know yet.
but he's the guy that's supposed to stop them from moving.
did they.
he's like defence I think.
yeah I don't know.
he said first lineman.
I don't know much about I don't know yo tampoco conozco mucho football.
I think he told me first lineman.
he says.
mommy you would be so proud of me.
I know.
I said.
I'm proud of you know.
exactly.
because of course I don't what him to play.
I know because you don't want to him to break anything god forbid.
but you know what?
I don't wanna stifle him.
que la vida hay que hacer de todo un poco.
yo nunca aprendí a nadar ni roller skate.
ni ni ni ni no hice muchas cosas en mi vida because
yo tampoco.
swimming I I should have learned how to swim.
swimming oh my god that's a perfect.
I regretted so much.
yeah that's the perfect thing to do when you get older.
and you know.
but when you get older you're over the hill.
perfect thing to do it when you're younger.
yeah but yeah.
I know but I'm saying.
como Carmencita se tiene que aprender.
she has to learn.
let's talk a little bit about Carmencita.
tiene que aprender.
mother insinuated that I should put her in camp this year.
I don't think so.
I told her I rather pay you and you take her.
she can come with me any time.
because.
pero you know she likes.
last year we had a great time.
yeah.
because mother was saying.
we.
cause mother maybe because mummy no la puede cuidar.
mamá no la puede cuidar.
yo entiendo.
it's a conflict.
pero a mí no me gustaría ponerla en camp por las amigas.
yeah.
yo te voy a decir una cosa las amigas.
the further away.
por eso ella se puso brava conmigo.
porque la amiguita esta que yo vi que estaba con el muchacho ahí.
what a stressful situation for that guy.
he's in elementary school.
and the girl is making advances towards him.
you know what is the guy supposed to do.
y qué hizo el muchachito?
qué podía hacer el pobre?
se estaba tranquilo.
no hizo nada.
estaba tranquilo.
ella cogió la mano del muchachito.
se la puso en la pierna de ella.
y qué hizo él?
la dejó ahí.
pobrecito what was he supposed.
pobrecito no.
it's a it's a lot of stress for boys because these girls they don't know how to behave.
they don't.
pero gracias a dios Carmencita no está en eso.
bueno.
no yo no he visto.
no no yo tampoco.
entonces las otras madres me dijeron que tampoco está que la están mirando y tampoco está en eso.
pero.
pero eso nada yo te digo la verdad.
yo estaba sorprendida.
yo creo que hoy la voy a sorprender porque ella va ir al parque hoy she's gonna go to the park today.
yeah.
and I leave at four which is great.
I love the hours here.
oh thank god.
from eight to four.
well you start early anyway.
well there gonna be times I have to stay like when they're doing stuff.
you know I might have to stay.
but that's not not everyday.
and sometimes when they have graduations I have to stay to help them whatever.
yeah.
but that's not every day.
so like once every two or three months.
thank god this is a blessing because people that are mothers.
yeah.
you can't you've gotta be on the top of these kids.
yeah.
but today she wants to go to the park because I told her.
I let you go today to the park.
Friday Saturday and Sunday you gotta be you know doing your.

tomorrow you should work on it the all day.
well you you see how good she is with the computer man.
I know she is.
did you do.
but I didn't see any of the research under the three people or the four people.
yeah we have we have research but not enough.
not enough.
and I think the pictures looked too big.
she brought me a book.
me trajo un libro que ella lo había leído when she was in third grade I think.
she did?
really?
pero las fotos vas a tener que hacerlas más chiquitas para que.
no ella lo quiere así grande.
pero cómo si no te puede flip?
no ella no quiere.
ella dice que la maestra lo hizo así.
and I said.
really?
ok.
fine.
that's fine.
I say.
you know what?
the instructions no sirven because te dicen que lo pongas arriba y la maestra dijo que lo ponga abajo.
exacto.
what kind of instructions are that?
I don't know sister.
thank god that you're a teacher.
oh my god.
and praise the lord que you know what you're doing with her praise god.
praise god yeah.
so due tomorrow can you just work on it?
do you think you can just work on it all day with her?
yeah we'll work on it.
she's very good.
if you finish tomorrow then you're home free with that.
but then there's a science project.
you already know more or less what you're gonna do with her?
yeah we know what we're gonna do.
how long will the science project take?
I don't know.
but you know what they do is for the parents to do their work.
no I know that.
I know that.
you know how many projects ella hizo
tantos proyectos que ha hecho.
what kind of a feedback did you get?
nothing.
what kind of a feedback?
but they they're ridiculous.
did they tell you when the science project is due or not?
er in April the first day that you they get back from their vacation.

mmhm.
yo le dijo que ella que ella tiene que darle muchas gracias a dios que te tiene a ti sis porque tú eres una mujer muy muy educada.
no she's good.
ella es buena.
y eres maestra de profession.
and you know what you're doing.
you know these are
kids don't know.
they don't know whether they're coming or going.
it's a joke.
it's supposed to be fun.
pero you know what the way they do it.
sí pero these teachers assigning these projects the kids don't even know if they're coming or going.
what do they expect?
I don't know if they are gonna remember any of this stuff down the line.
maybe they will.
maybe these things are good.
so getting back to Carmencita.
yeah.
do you wanna take care of her for the summer then?
and I'll just give you something for that.
yeah.
I'm thinking
it's like three months right.
so er
we can work at it.
ahora yo no sé me gustaría que ella aprendiera a nadar.
well maybe you could take her.
you know I I'm gonna see maybe maybe.
I'll give you the money for that.
if Armand finds a job I need him to get to work.
tu hijo?
yeah.
qué tú quieres que haga?
anything I'm gonna put him in Publix anywhere.
because last year he worked with Nancy.
but this year I don't know.
y este año no puede trabajar.
no.
are they cutting back personnel pues no hay dinero.
oh.
yeah.
no hay dinero en ninguna parte.
y el stress level oye.
él tiene dieciséis años ya.
ya.
él puede trabajar en la biblioteca también.
sería un buen trabajo then.
well because of the allergies no me gustaría.
los libros.
tú sabes dust mites he's very allergic.
so what did you have in mind for him?
I don't know.
I said Publix.
you want him to work at Publix in in in the street there ninety fifty street by the house?
yeah you know anybody there?
I could go help you.
I could go talk for you.
yeah good.
not that you can't.
I mean you do it because you talk just as well.
well I applied last year.
pero it was very late.
y qué te dijeron?
and they already had hired todo el mundo que ellos necesitaban.
we can go.
and find out.
so.
we can go and
because I'm when I'm there I can enquire for the summer.
yeah.
like what hours.
they make you go.
and fill out this application.
como todas las horas tú quieres que él trabaje.
I I could drop him off.
pick up Carmencita.
pick up Armand.
drop off Carmencita.
no conflict of interest.
pero a qué hora más o menos like from eight to or nine?

he's sixteen years old no?
yeah.
yeah he's sixteen.
he'll be sixteen April thirtieth.
it's a great location.
yeah I like it.
and you know the supervision there probably is better than other places.
exacto.
y al lado de la casa.
vamos a ver.
it's not too far from the house.
no.
está bueno.
maybe they can teach him how to be a cashier instead of a bag boy?
but you want him to be a stock boy?
whatever.
I don't care.
if he were if he did a cashier
I don't want him to be a stock boy.
but cashier but you know.
but usually they have er women doing cashier.
do they no they have some guys.
I've never seen a guy there.
I don't think I've seen a guy there.
the bag boys.
yeah the bag boys are guys.
do you want me to have requests?
and they they're really handicapped the ones that are bag boys.
yeah.
do you want me to request to see if they can train him how to be a cashier?
he's good in math.
no I know.
but will he be bored with that?
cashier?
I don't know.
if not then what is it left the stock or there's the deli.
oh he would like that.
to make sandwiches.
but you can't work in there until you are eighteen.
oh really so you've done your homework.
yeah.
te conoce.
only why.
I tell you why.
porque si se cortan.
sí.
puede pasar algo.
así a mí no me gustan.
I didn't think about the machines.
the machine.
pero I thought maybe instead of the machine then he likes er baking.
but you can't.
not even in the baking section?
you gotta be eighteen.
no se puede hacer?
porque él sabe hacerlo.
y él tiene todas las herramientas.
no que they have their own anyways so
he loves it.
le encanta baking.
what did you think about the the brownies?
oh they were outstanding.
I ate them all.
and then mother goes.
oh there's some more left.
qué rico.
and then I go.
no ya yo me lo comí.
y entonces me lo me lo comí todo un día siguiente al otro.
y cuando Carmencita fue dice.
nada yo te todo.
see I love sweets.
that's my problem sister.
you don't like sweets as much as I do.
I mean I love sweets.
no I can take it or leave it.
no me no me hace nada anyway.
lo que sí hace es ponerte gorda.
no yo sé.
and I don't need that.
no no not at all.
we don't.
none of us need that.
I know.
and I was reading you know que sugar is bad even for cancer because the cancer cells.
really?
yeah they feed on sugar.
mmhm.
so that's not good.
es mejor.
yo no sabía.
you should tell that to Carmencita because Carmencita loves sugar.
really?
we're gonna.
tienes que decir.
sí pero tienes que decírselo.
sí esa parte yo no sabía.
maybe now for sure.
that will cure me big time.
because I love sweets.
I I had an article that someone sent me en en el internet.
mmhm.
sí ahí decía todo de eso.
sabes quién lo tiene Marcelo.
really?
eats a lot of sweets too.
she does?
have you spoken to her lately?
yeah.
cómo está bien?
she called me the other day.
yeah happy go lucky.
cuándo vas a ver el apartamento de ella?
tú sabes you know no tengo tiempo para eso.
tienes que ir porque te vas a.
su mamita.
pero es que a mí no me gusta heights anyway.
no but you gotta go sis.
I'm not kidding.
you have promise me you're gonna go.
go with Carmencita this week coming up.
ok.
maybe.
no you have to!
yeah with with Carmencita I can go.
yeah go with Carmencita.
I'll take her to the pool.
yeah maybe you can teach her how to swim porque tiene que saber.
y eso.
I know how to teach.
pero yo no sé nadar bien.
pero ahí ahí no pasa nada anyway.
pero mira a ver si le puedes enseñar porque lo que pasa es que todas las fiestas ahora del summer people are gonna learn people are gonna know how to swim.
and she's the only one who can't go to the parties.
I mean I take her to the parties.
but then she feels like she's left out.
she a drag not to know how to swim man.
hay que saber hay que saber porque estamos surrounded by water.
I I hope
I know sis.
you know?
but I don't know what to tell you porque ella no no se quiere mojar la cara.
y no sé como va a aprender.
y a mí no me gusta el agua fría.
cuando uno va al swimming pool ahí no me gusta.
y si va uno a al mar to the ocean.
no you know what happened at the ocean the other day?
what happened?
that when we went to the park all the kids decided they wanted to go into the ocean.
mmhm.
and of course Carmencita no fue.
fue pero no se metió en el agua.
and all the kids got sting stung by a
men of war?
yeah.
todos.
llorando y gritando.
y yo estaba feliz que mi hija no había entrado.
no estaba feliz pues they got hurt.
no of course.
y no llamé a las madres para que.
I think you put vinegar no?
I think was urinating orinando.
or or pee yeah.
it's supposed to.
pero pero todos los niños llorando porque dicen que le dolía mucho.
y Carmencita tú sabes.
pero esto tampoco no le ayuda a Carmencita porque le da miedo entrar al agua porque ella tú sabes que le da miedo de todo.
so if she would have got stung that would have been her first experience.
she wouldn't have been going back in the ocean.
I'll tell you that much.
oh my god.
pero no tenían el flag out there?
no.
no?
there was no flag.
this is by.
yeah.
no tenían un lifeguard?
no no tenían.
no lifeguard?
nothing.
that's not good.
no that's terrible.
no not good at all.
so.
yo te digo la verdad mira eso de sting rates.
e eso es muy peligroso.
y ahora yo no sé qué está pasando.
que hasta they are coming down to the shores and oh my god.
it's very scary.
porque yo le tengo mucho respeto al agua.
so the ocean is gonna be off limits for me anyway.
a Nerea le encanta el agua.
really well you know what?
now that Luis is is behaving we should go back on the ocean because I don't think it's gonna be wild.
I hate it.
I hate it too.
but you know he loves his boating.
I know.
and then his kids have been using it.
every weekend los niños de él.
let him go out with his kids.
no I know.
say.
honey I'll wait for you here.
on land.
I'll go to the movies while you are on the ocean.
I'm safe territory.
yeah.
no no no no.
a él le encanta su bote.
ah pero no últimamente no está yendo nada.
mmhm.
a los niños.
they took over his boat.
mmhm.
in a way I'm I'm happy.
yeah let them have it.
you know who likes it?
no.
my son.
really?
and.
he even wants to play he wants to learn how to play an airplane.
he does?
do you know Luis is a is is is knows how to fly.
yeah.
he has his license and everything.
a mí no me gusta nada de eso.
but I told him.
don't go get your.
you don't have to renew it.
I yeah.
you have to renew it.
yo le dije.
don't renew anything.
porque yo no me voy airplane with him.
no.
I did it once.
I went on a on an airplane que era chiquitito.
this guy told me that he was a doctor.
he lied about that.
this is when I was single.
oh yeah.
is that?
Paul you met my sister right?
yeah.
Paul in the refrigerator sweetheart there's a thing called an empanada.
I bought I bought it yesterday.
you weren't here.
have one.
you are gonna love it.
I bought it at a Colombian restaurant.
oh good.
that's where we are gonna go to lunch today.
yeah good.
un restaurante más rico!
mmhm.
it's Colombian and their empanadas.
they know how to cook.
yeah.
but you cook too sis.
yeah.
I cook seven days a week.
a mí me gusta cocinar.
see I don't.
a mí me gusta.
I don't because.
although for Luis like this week I made him some filet mignon.
hay que hacerlo.
I made him some fillet mignon week.
don't overcook it.
that's all you have to do.
yeah and then I made him a salad.
and Carmencita of course estaba comiendo su macaroni and cheese.
that's ok.
ella come lo que le gusta.
no come cosas que le que le sean nutritional you know.
bueno está comiendo pizza which is a cheese and a a little bit of the sauce.
yeah.
it's also very fattening.
I know.
the french fries está comiendo los chicken nuggets.
she likes those.
also fried food.
yeah.
eventually.
she's eating more salads though.
yeah eventually yo creo no sé yo creo que ella va a comenzar a comer mejor.
yeah.
she's eating chicken caesar salad now.
that's good.
that's very good.
so I need to today.
I don't want to go to Publix and buy her some more chicken caesar.
she loves it.
yeah?
you know the ones that come bagged?
yeah.
a ella le encanta comer eso.
es que hoy en día como uno está tan ocupado.
yo cocino en veinte treinta minutos.
pero with the help of a lot of people.
for example you know like for instance today ya yo tengo rosetti.
it's just it's a pasta that's stuffed.
all I have to do is heat it up put the sauce on top a little bit of sugar.
and I have a meal with a with a salad.
but what's in the pasta cheese?
yeah it's stuffed shells.
so that's one meal.
y cuánto tú le sirves a todo el mundo?
so when I say que yo tengo ayuda de otra gente quiero decir que I use frozen vegetables.
I thought that you meant that you had helping you.
no are you kidding me?
I'm serious.
do they ever wash the dishes?
I.
because yesterday Luis Luis was washing the dishes yesterday.
no they never wash them.
I was impressed.
no.
because you know he would never wash dishes before.
they are allergic to water.
yeah.
they never wash the dishes unless of course I say.
you know what?
I'm on strike.
y no voy a lavar hoy.
ahí que se queden las cosas.
oh they don't like when I say that.
right.
I say.
how would you like it?
just because I'm a housewife I'm always washing?
no.
I'm gonna get arthritis god forbid.
no no no no.
no es que me duelen los dedos de verdad!
well the guys should help.
no that's not good.
yo fui al médico.
y le dije.
you think this is arthritis?
me dice.
no parece que sea arthritis.
yo le dije.
pero doctor I have a terrible pain in my finger.
not good.
so Adrian says it's the kickboxing.
I shouldn't do kickboxing.
and I love kickboxing!
how could you take kickboxing away from me?
exactly.
it's my life.
do you love kickboxing?
I need to start on my treadmill también.
oh my god.
I I tell you I wish he would go with me.
ahora que Luis Luis ha estado ahora.
tú sabes que va a coger otra vez el gas station.
sí.
he got rid of the one in.
gracias a dios.
and he's gonna take one two weeks.
but this time he's gonna have an associate because it's it's very expensive.
I know.
his cousin.
yeah.
so it's very nice.
it's big.
to start he's gonna take one.
and then maybe eventually he'll have another one.
yeah.
so he'll be back at it.
bueno es el negocio de él.
yeah he's good at it.
eso es lo que él él sabe.
él sabe digamos de accounting.
or how much he's gonna make.
and he calculates todas esas cosas.
no he knows.
when it comes to running a store and that's his expertise.
that's his business.
I mean I can
and people actually look for him to ask him his opinion.
he's like a consultant.
and I said you should charge!
yeah.
instead of giving free opinion.
advice.
yeah.
gente Cobra.
dios lo bendiga.
tú sabes él he knows his business.
yes he does.
and the way he conducts himself people look up to him.
yeah he is a very serious guy.
yeah.
he is serious?
now he is more serious.
pobrecito.
no he is really serious.
but yesterday we were watching T V.
was on he says.
did you know anything about Publix?
oh.
and I said what.
and then I told him I needed some Ajax soap.
and he went.
and he got it for me.
oh you know a relationship goes through a lot of different phases.
you know.
I'm trying to sell I mean rent this house.
ay no quieras saber.
I'm going crazy with it.
did you rent it or you didn't?
no not yet.
eso le queda.
people tell me.
oh sí ya voy para allá señora.
y me dejan esperando two three four hours.
y no vienen.
that's terrible.
it's terrible.
so anyway do you have your condo?
el condo que tú tienes ahí.
tampoco está alquilado.
and the beach?
yeah.
cuánto tú tú arrentas ese lugar?
fifteen hundred and it's beautiful inside.
el condo.
es dos cuartos?
dos cuartos
dónde tenía Adrian su apartamento?
sí pero el mío es mucho más limpio porque está todo limpiecito pintadito.
lo que pasa es que están arreglando.
el edificio o el apartamento?
el edificio afuera le están poniendo todo nuevo pero no han llegado to my unit.
right.
so you know
I mean the only thing that you can really use es el balcón.
so they are gonna put they are gonna put they are gonna put they are gonna put in your unit?
they are gonna they are gonna fix your unit too?
yeah the whole thing.
I mean it's astronomical lo que están cobrando.
really?
for the maintenance alone I'm paying close to a thousand dollars.
see that's what Luis says.
he says it's horrible.
it's not worth it.
listen if you wanna go see it it's a beautiful place sis.
nadie te molesta.
está todo nuevecito adentro.
I know I know that he's gonna see one.
pero los baños no son tan modernos como el que tú tienes aquí en en el condo.
en el condo.
we are supposed to go see one today at six.
because he has to move.
yeah I know.
he because the because the owner can't afford it.
it's in for closure.
it is for closure!
so many people are in for closure!
so the owner but the owner hasn't told them anything.
I don't know how many millions of rooms are gonna be in for closures.
but he got the letter from the attorney.
I don't know.
pero parece que hay otros lugares en el en el mismo lugar que a lo mejor va a ser más barato.
porque él está pagando dos mil ahora.
sí.
so he's figured prize.
listen if you wanna move in there I'll give it to you cheaper.
he says you know what because we could get it for a lot cheaper so called them.
y le dijo.
ve para acá porque hay un edificio el agua y todo.
vamos a ver cuánto quiere.
si el tipo quiere dos mil dólares le voy a decir que no.
you know aunque yo no lo pago.
lo va a pagar Luis but you know still.
no pero de todos modos no vale la pena.
yo te digo sinceramente.
I think that you both should come and see it.
es lindo.
I'll ask him today.
in fact Luis se iba a mudar ahí.
iba a vender su casa.
y se iba a mudar ahí.
I think he said que se iba a mudar a un condominium.
sí se iba a mudar ahí porque es bonito.
but what happened?
that house is beautiful.
he he is not he is not retired yet.
he should.
I know.
if I if I was his age and his money I would have retired.
pero a él
pero a él le gusta trabajar.
pero es una estupidez.
he wanted to be this.
he is almost sixty years old already.
how old is he like
sixty three I think.
so he should retire and be happy.
I think that at sixty five you can retire with a better income.
who cares about the income?
he he he he is fine.
well this is what this is what he told me.
he should live he should live.
if things would get rough where he is working now
then he would retire.
he would give them their working papers.
and he would retire.
tienes mucha razón.
right now you know what?
a él le gusta la gente que le trabajan.
they look up to him.
él se siente contento ahí aunque tiene mucho trabajo.
no if they respect him that's good.
they respect him.
and you know what?
when you retire many times you vegetate.
you are throwing the towel.
yeah.
that's what I don't wanna do.
well you are never gonna retire because you are gonna live a hundred and twenty.
and then you have Carmencita's all of middle school elementary.
so one more year.
I'm I'm getting this adventure now yeah.
then you have middle school.
and then you have high school.
well I have this invention going that hopefully they will bite.
and if they bite you know I will have an income there.
praise god.
a steady income yeah thank god.
but you are gonna have like like a warehouse or something like that?
no I don't wanna do that.
I just want to sell my ideas.
déjalos que ellos se maten haciendo lo que yo quiero hacer.
de producto.
hacer el producto.
este market it.
sell it.
are you just gonna get the royalties?
manufacture it.
just royalties.
that's good sis.
if they like my ideas.
yo le dije al tipo yo le dije.
you know what the it's needed.
it's something that is needed so how could you fail?
people will buy it.
it's not something that er
yeah do you remember that that stupid guy I was recently dating?
he was saying that he uses gloves.
yeah.
pero que las manos le sudaban mucho.
eso era lo que tú estabas patentando verdad?
sí.
sí.
so entonces eh I think it would sell.
I know it's gonna sell.
now let's see if the guy bites.
he wrote to me.
but he's not the only one.
no this is the second one I'm approaching.
and what did he say?
he's a a a big supplier to big big stores.
he manufactures all kinds of stuff.
and what did he say finally?
so.
I don't know I'm waiting for his response a ver qué me dice.
tú qué crees?
yo creo que sí.
yo creo que le va a encantar because
anything that you decide to do sis is very intelligent.
I I'm banking on that sis.
I really am banking on that because I like to see you know something that I do.
to flourish.
to flourish.
and that everybody will benefit from it.
you are very good.
is gonna work for the rest of his life?
yeah.
because of the insurance.
yeah the insurance.
el insurance está carísimo.
oh yeah man.
tú te acuerdas cuando yo dejé de trabajar.
I went on Cobra.
mmhm.
it was it was ridiculous.
it was about a thousand dollars for Carmencita and I.
no se puede.
no se puede estar sin seguro.
a month!
so how do you do it so that you can retire?
you really cannot retire.
no you can't retire.
and mm I don't want him to retire either.
yeah.
most housewives would say that about their husbands.
you'll drive me crazy.
go to work honey.
go to work honey.
yeah he'll drive me nuts.
yeah.
that's er
you know.
but he's a good guy.
no no he is.
yeah.
he is.
you know like Luis you know Luis just if you just feed Luis and give him his television he is happy.
right.
they are quiet men.
yeah.
and I don't really have to feed him.
he'll say.
what do you want me to go get you?
so it's not like I have to cook.
that's a blessing.
exactly.
just for that keep him around.
yeah.
exactly.
no.
the other day he was shocked that I said.
no I'm gonna make you filet mignon.
you are?
yeah.
are you feeling ok?
yeah.
pero no lo molestas sis.
como no molestas.
si él se queda así eso sería un milagro de dios.
sería.
sí.
yo te digo la verdad.
él vino aquí el otro día.
sí.
conoció a a a Lola.
yeah.
so we'll see lo que.
él es buena gente.
yes he is.
yo siempre te lo he dicho.
he is a nice guy.
oh te dio yo no te di la car la carta?
yeah you gave me the letter yeah.
ah sí.
and er ya se la dimos al profesor y todo.
yo estaba haciendo otro para Carmencita.
enseñamelo porque she's gonna need community hours.
oh really?
sure.
she needs them now.
she needs them now for her no sé qué.
you know I think this is so ridiculous.
she had a good over a hundred hours of vodka.
oh please.
so I made that up.
and I'm making him sign it.
that's all.
yeah.
so
oh please.
oh please is right.
they don't even you know how to even feed themselves.
tú sabes cómo están las cosas ahí afuera con los nenes?
yo no voy a dejar que please.
no y tú viste que quiere ahora mi hija caminar sola al parque?
le dije que no.
no.
por supuesto que no.
dice que con con veinte niños y y two or three parents.
maybe si van dos o tres parents and like maybe ten or fifteen kids.
I don't like this looseness.
I don't like it either sis.
trust me it's the hardest job.
yo te digo it's very hard.
it's very very hard.
that's why I rather her being with you for the summer.
yeah.
piénsalo bien.
no yo lo que hoy digo es que sí.
yo I pick up.
mañana habla con ella.
you know I figure I can give you maybe two hundred dollars a month.
do you think is that too little?
yeah.
well whatever.
and then and then and then two hundred dollars a month for you and two hundred dollars to to do whatever.
the thing is
so it's four hundred dollars a month.
two hundred dollars for the expenses.
you know the food
we can calculate to see because cuando uno come afuera it's expensive.
well no two hundred dollars for her expenses for the food for the movies wherever you go.
yeah.
I think two hundred is ok.
or we could make it less than what we spend.
and then we make adjustments.
ok or we could that way.
I think that way is better.
you could just you could maybe that's another way of doing it.
yeah.
I give you the money for you.
and then whatever you spend you tell me.
right.
like we do with the stuff.
we put it yeah in a list.
and then do that way.
alright that would work.
that will work.
because yo no quiero.
pero let let's let's see if she wants to do that.
es que mamá fue como que esta mañana se lo dijo.
y ayer también.
you know empezó.
mother told her or she told her?
did mother bring it up or Carmencita brought it up?
no she brought it up.
tú ves entonces se me va a fastidiar a mí porque es mi hija.
con las amistades.
no es que mami prefiere que ella vaya al parque.
no yo no quiero que vaya al parque.
pero mami prefiere.
no but I don't prefer it.
and I'm the mother.
yeah.
if we can keep it controlled sis.
no no you got to.
entonces mira tú mañana vas a hacer proyecto con ella.
yeah.
mañana qué es?
sábado?
mañana mañana es viernes.
oh en viernes.
ella no tiene escuela.
oh yeah that'll be good.
ella no tiene escuela todo el día.
excellent.
tú si terminas la.
tú crees que puedas terminarlo mañana?
it would be great if you can.
it's a lot of work.
well.
sino you are gonna.
but we can we can.
no she's grounded on Saturday too so
we can
I don't like that.
but I would
I'd say let let's finish this quickly and maybe we can lift it.
now that's how I would work it.
you see what I'm talking about?
psychology?
yeah.
that that's that's turning it around.
well maybe that would work.
if she finishes all her project on Friday a lo mejor el sábado ella puede salir.
you know.
right.
or have a friend no salir tener una amiga en la casa.
you know no.
exactly.
tampoco yo no quiero.
no eso no.
pero that's how I I I was saying originally when we started this conversation yo te dije que I don't believe in punishment like that.
ok so that'll do good.
I mean she deserved she deserved.
well in eleven years I've never punished her.
sure this is my first time punishing her.
but she deserves it she deserves it.
she has a big mouth.
tú sabes que yo nunca le le he dado un punishment a mi hija.
sí.
éste éste sería el primero en los años de existencia.
bueno.
pero es que a veces hay que hacerlo.
ya el el máximo.
ya ella se hizo el máximo.
no puede estar hablando así boberías.
no.
no.
no.
entonces vamos.
that's a good idea sis.
yeah.
that's what I said at the beginning.
te acuerdas que te dije?
and then next week monday tiene que hacerlo los dientes.
going yeah.
te voy a dar un blind check.
ponles los braces.
ponles.
esa es otra cosa que le va a molestar toda el week.
well she wants some.
she wanted it on Thursday today.
she wants you to take her today porque she wants to show it to her friends.
really?
oh my god.
no todos los niños los tienen.
well ese the good thing es que she is a kid.
it's like a fad right know with the kids.
and she wanted right away.
she said that she's not gonna give you hard time ni nada.
que no va a llorar ni nada.
ok good.
I'll say.
you know what?
I'll go outside.
so ponlo pónselo.
y entonces.
pero the last time she was so good.
ya.
she was so good when they were pulling out that tooth.
or they were filling it they were filling it.
she's big now.
now she's by herself.
oh yeah no she's very smart.
I said.
mamita te aguanto la mano mamita?
no I'm ok.
she's brilliant.
she's smart kid.
and she's very well loved.
they love her.
I said.
ok.
doctor loves her.
pero she needs a braces up here.
aquí va a tener uno.
tiene tres dientes que le están se le van a salir me dijo.
I said.
why don't you let me touch it?
no because she said the last time I touched her I it.
what?
I did.
all of her teeth.
but why you go back into her mouth and do it again?
I said I said.
let me touch them.
let me see how.
ella no me deja.
ella no quiere que ni le toque el pelo.
ni que le toque los dientes.
no quiere.
antes que te vayas quiero que te enseñe.
si Tom no está ahí que te enseñe la parte cuando ella está caminando conmigo en el.
sí.
oye qué fantástico.
hasta me dio ganas de llorar.
ay no.
sí me dio ganas de llorar because.
she is growing up.
you know what these things really do happen.
of course.
you know and and.
you said only in the protection of the lord are we safe.
Moses I love you.
I love him with all my heart.

y tú durmiendo.
yo vine para acá hoy por la mañana.
y me puse a hacer los los los platos.
y la única razón por la cual no los terminé fue porque el niño venía para acá.
y quería la leche.
yo me fui para allá para despertarme.
a qué hora?
varias veces.

no.
that had to have been there when I went outside.

and then I came back in.
and he went outside.
and he goes estaba buscando.

I have to take apart that pool put in the new liner.
and that's.
you found the liner?
I I had to go to four different places and I found I the ah Pinch a penny over here on Bird Road.
they said I had to order it.
it was special order.
that they don't keep any of those things any more.
I went to Home Depot the Home Depot next to where Paulo works.
they didn't have it.
they didn't have even those um those liners from landscaping.
the ponds?
right.
I went to Walmart.
they didn't have it.
I went to the other Home Depot across the street from Walmart.
they had it.
and they had one and I hope it'll be big enough to be able to do it but it's black.
it's a black liner.
what did you have there before?
a blue liner a blue pool liner.
you know?
well I don't think it really matters.
no I don't think it's gonna matter but you know as long as it's it resists as long as it resists at least for for tomorrow night.
I've never noticed which colour it is.
that's what's important.
you know?
and ah so I'm hoping that that'll that'll do well.
oh you didn't tell me.
how did it go yesterday?
where?
at church.
I I will.
Angelo's homily was very innocuous.
as usual.
um everything went well.
I spoke to Father Hank.
he went in.
he was all nervous because we were working today together.
mhmm.
and he said.
you know I was reading about what had to be done.
and and and and I go.
look.
I said.
chill.
he goes.
you've done it before.
I said.
I've been doing it for ten years.
ok I said.
don't worry about it.
I know how to do everything.
you concentrate on your homily.
and ah and he goes.
do you wanna preach?
and I go.
no no no no you're the one who's preaching.
and he goes.
no because you know I'm me I'm preaching on the Sunday already.
and I go.
I'm preaching the Easter vigil.
I don't need to
I said.
that's one less thing I have to worry about.
well you go ahead and and do that.
and then he was ah he goes to me.
oh congratulations on your new position.
I hear you're gonna be vice principal of the school.
and I told him.
yeah.
and he goes.
oh you're gonna be working with Sister Maria.
oh she's so wonderful.
so he likes her?
yes he loves Sister Maria.
he says.
she's so wonderful.
she was the vi she was the principal at ah Little Flower um when I was there teaching C C D.
and she's just such a wonderful person.
and she's just so nice.
and all this other stuff na na na na na na.
you need to bring him by to win her over.
and I told him.
you know you would have been good for the for Father Derrik's position.
yeah it was just lack of experience.
yeah.
so anyway.
so let's see.
and my mom says she's gonna go at three.
for the stations of the cross.
for the stations of the cross.
and then she's gonna stay at four for the Good Friday service so that you can go at seven and you can leave her the baby.
oh great.
ok.
so
what about your mom has to be there for the Easter vigil.
and Esmerelda wants to go because Nancy's gonna be baptized there.
ooooh.
so um
I'm gonna try to go and stay as long as I can.
maybe my sister will take care of him.
maybe he'll even sleep there.
no.
well why not?
sleep there?
pick him up on Sunday morning.
yeah well ask her.
how's the coffee?
it's very good.
I only had uh.
I bought French Vanilla Cream because that was the only one that they had at B J's.
I was getting kind of tired of the Creme Brulee.
ok I'm gonna go to my school.
I need to give the tickets to the other teachers for the stuff that I turned in.
and I'll take Paco.
ok what time are you leaving?
when the house is picked up.
oh so that would mean you know tomorrow or something like that.
oh ok so then you can stay her finish picking up the house.
I'll pick up just a little bit.
I'm not gonna pick up the whole thing.
ok?
I mean Esmerelda's room is disgusting.
she needs to pick that up.
and Paul's not here.
I imagine he went to work.
mmhm.
y tengo un dolor de cabeza de este tamaño.
why don't you take some Tylenol?
I am I'm gonna take some.
and as usual.
I put it next to your side of the bed!
as usual every time Easter comes.
and I have to do all this stuff in the in the parish.
I get sick.
Gordo is sick too.
me dio una entrada de patadas anoche.
I don't know how many times he kicked me in the bed.
no.
I don't remember him kicking me.
so he must have been facing me the whole time.
no it was me.
it was me.
he was kicking me the whole time.
I didn't sleep very well either.
I was waking up at three and at four and at five.
I slept pretty well.
yeah I know you did.
you were snoring.
yeah I must have slept well.
and quite loud I might add.
and Paco was snoaring really loud too.
so anyway.
I'm gonna go drop that off at the motor home when I leave for the parish.
bueno de qué más quieres hablar?
um yesterday the principle called me in.
she goes.
I wanna talk to you before I I speak to that teacher.
the one that has that problem.
yes.
and um and I go um.
I wanna.
she goes to me.
I wanna speak to you before I talk to her because I want the union to be ok with this.
and uh and I go.
ok.
and so I go to her.
yeah well you know let me know about about what's going on.
and she goes.
no I'm telling you what I'm planning to do because you know when when she comes in she's probably gonna be upset or whatever.
she might come to you.
oh because she's coming back to work?
ok.
she came back to work.
she came back to work.
yeah you know I was mentioning that you know people talk about the catholic church and how um priests that molest children like get transfered.
just get transfered from one place to another and the school system is doing the same thing.
but but the school system is about just about the same category then.
because her dad is an attorney and her brother is an attorney.
so they're more scared of the lawsuit than they are of ethical things.
right they're more scared of the lawsuit from her the employee than the lawsuit from the parents.
yeah.
because the the parents didn't do anything but the parents are more concerned and took them out took the kids out.
imagine that's a free program.
you know and so anyhow um she goes.
she had come to the principle had come to me a couple days ago and she goes um.
the person that you sent me an email and the resume do you know them personally?
and I go.
truthfully no.
I know her boyfriend.
um I know her via email but you know because you know we've gone back and forth.
then she is in a position where she wants to
who's this?
la novia de
the manager of Payway.
oh ok yeah.
but he but he.
right right right that she was in that school in.
she's in Belair.
she's in Belair.
she's in fifth grade.
E S E.
well that's exactly what she needs over here.
pero ella no quiere traer a alguien.
tú sabes she goes.
so then tell them that they have to leave again.
no no.
because she's been working there less than three years.
she has to get that approved.
she you know it's the bureaucracy.
it takes a while.
so she goes um.
I need the person that I have up there now.
no da la talla.
you know I mean I need to get rid of them.
and um I need to bring in somebody else.
but with that other person they're already in the system.
so it's gonna take a long return.
even though they're in the system they're somewhere else so it has to get approved by the district the the the change.
even if.
even the principals and stuff right?
the principal.
you you remember what I went through ok.
and so she goes.
cause I had told her if she comes back what we need to do is don't put her in don't put her in that classroom put her in a higher grade you know where kids can talk and kids can talk and kids can tell you exactly what's going on.
and so she goes.
yeah but I think she's only certified for pre K.
entonces estamos you know stuck with her.
entonces she um she goes to me.
no but I need I looked up her her stuff.
and she is K through six pre K and K through six elementary.
well perfect.
and she is emotionally.
put her put her with six grades six grades.
no no we don't have six grade.
oh that's right.
fifth grade.
put her put her with fifth grade students.
they will eat her alive.
then she'll leave.
of course eso es lo que tú quieres.
um le dije.
la unión me va a botar porque yo no estoy.
she goes.
I go no.
eso pero es que
yo le dije.
eso es lo que tú tenías que hacer desde un principio.
yo sí pero es que yo no sabía que ella estaba you know certificada hasta hasta quinto grado.
y ellos no miran nada los los papeles y los expedientes de la gente?
ay mi amor ella es una principal nueva.
you know?
ella está
tú sabes.
she's great.
but she's new.
ella no se sabe todavía cómo access the things or and how to you know
she goes.
she asks people.
you know er the person that gave her the position or whatever.
and told her.
listen look at what she's you know certified in.
because that's the first thing I had asked her.
what is she certified in?
put her somewhere else.
but I guess she hadn't really done any until she you know somebody told her how to do it.
entonces yo le dije.
ahí sí que no puedo haber decir nada porque si es un una decisión administrativa.
si a mí me cambian mañana de first grade a algo que yo no quiero.
quinto grado como me hizo la principal de de la otra escuela.
eh she has every right to do so.
ahí it's her administrative decision that I would do best in this class.
whether I like it or not that's I mean they should take that into consideration.
but they don't have to.
but at any rate didn't they get somebody to replace her while she was gone?
they had a sub.
and so what happened when this woman came back?
well she requested not to have the people that you know made the allegations in the classroom.
and she said.
look I've nowhere else to put them.
so she obviously felt very uncomfortable working there.
good.
but then that's also something that um our principal told er la principal me dijo me dijo um como ella er me había dicho que ella quería no estar con esta persona yo le voy a decir que mira como tú te sientes que que piense que sea por ella.
mmhm mmhm.
yo dije.
perfecto.
así ella piensa que tú le estás haciendo un favor a ella.
y ella no va a dar la talla para eso.
porque ahí eh me lo dijo.
y todos esos chiquitos hablan.
oh yeah.
they're emotionally you know disabled.
pero le dicen hasta alma mía.
entonces por eso la otra no podía.
E S E is really really really difficult.
mmhm mmhm.
y más cuando when you have you know kids that are the violent ones los que
ah entonces la cosa pasó que ayer durante
ella tenía una reunión.
like a C S T it's like a it's it's a child study team.
so she was meeting with some parents and a counselor whatever.
so she wasn't in the classroom.
y entonces um quién me vino a decir eso Dios mío?
yo creo que fue Pili.
me vino a decir er no que uno de los niños de la clase de ahí de ella lo encontraron en la calle descalzo running through the street.
entonces figúrate.
la principal les cayó a ellos.
y dijo.
pero qué pasó?
entonces la principal fue adentro de la clase er que you know to find out what happened.
how could this child just walk out?
entonces habían dejado había there was like an electrical cord that didn't keep the door from closing all the way.
the child snuck out.
but this is from your school?
yeah from her class.
where are you going?
ok hurry up because I don't want you to leave your brother out there alone.
and um the the child snuck out.
so the principal went in there to try to see how could this happen and how to prevent it from happening again.
porque dice que the person that fou two people that found
you know figúrate.
around the park people walk around.
you know so they found this este es un niñito chiquitico sin zapatos.
because it was nap time.
er corriendo por ahí.
entonces they brought him back dice que que el señor was a Vietnam veteran.
y dice que estaba hasta llorando.
porque dice que que le recordó a los niños er en Vietnam you know running with the bombs and stuff and barefoot.
and and you know dice que que estaba you know he was really traumatized with the whole thing.
figúrate it looks horrible on the school.
entonces um she goes.
I went in there.
I was talking to the aids.
y tú sabes dónde estaba la dueña?
I know she was in a meeting during that time.
she goes.
yeah but it's her classroom.
she estaba recogiendo como si no fuera nada con ella.
she was.
si es tu clase donde algo que pasó con tu estudiante tú no vas a estar ahí presente para que no ocurra de nuevo?
y ésta es la misma que fue acusada?
sí.
so she doesn't she doesn't give a damn about the kids.
no she doesn't!
of course she doesn't!
y ésta no es la primera vez que le ha caído esto arriba.
en otra escuela o sea yo yo le había dicho
eventualmente ella se va a ir.
pero le va a tirar ese problema a otra persona.
ahora la cosa es que in fifth grade E S E ella está en el building de nosotros donde ella puede estar constantentemente vigilando.
y tiene personas al lado.
y ella seguro que le va a decir a las a las maestras de al lado que que sean bien vigilantes you know.
um y además de eso ella puede estar constantemente chequeándole los
because e ella es un desastre.
she doesn't have plans.
she doesn't have you know she comes up with things al último minuto.
ella no toma eso en serio.
bueno.
pero yo le dije.
perfecto eso es lo perfecto.
porque yo le eso es lo que exactamente lo que yo le había dicho a la principal desde un principio.
y yo le había dicho.
tenemos que meterla en una clase para acá.
donde podemos estar
y ustedes tú sabes caminan you know en la clase lo que sea.
entonces yo le dije.
oye a mí no me van a botar.
nos van a botar para el carajo.
she was.
you know because sinceramente la unión es secundario.
para mí lo primero.
es los niños.
es los niños.
absolutely.
y además eso es lo que dice el contrato.
que the primary purpose of the educators is the student.
so I'm going by the contract.
el que me diga
pero además ella no está haciendo nada
claro las dos sabemos que lo que queremos es que se vaya para el carajo pero
pero ahí sí que puede ella documentar.
porque ahí ella sí que tiene que tener las cosas bien organizadas.
yeah.
I think Katie is gonna start in a school in June.
she already resigned?
mmhm well I don't know if she's resigned.
but she hasn't signed the contract yet.
then she hasn't resigned.
but um I think they started calling people down to sign their contracts on Thursday.
mmhm.
I mean not Thursday yesterday.
yesterday was Wednesday.
but yeah yesterday.
no yesterday was Thursday.
yes.
no Wednesday.
I'm sorry.
they started calling um people down.
so I imagine that they'll be calling her soon to go sign her contract.
and then the nun said that er to see if she could be coming in you know at some point maybe for like a week or something.
just to see how things are.
and then and then probably start in June to try and get the
yo te digo sinceramente.
er yo sé que Emily really wants to you know work there or whatever pero.
it may be better for her not to.
for you and for her.
porque qué pasa con las cosas de Pedrito?
te vienen a ti.
qué va a pasar con las cosas de ella?
they are gonna come to me.
right.
so.
no mi papá me lo dijo.
mi papá me lo dijo.
mira alégrate de que no le den trabajo ahí a Paul.
y y esta chiquita bueno ya está ahí.
y y Paul es muy muy hot headed?
no Paul uff.
a Paul lo van a botar de varios lugares si no se cuida.
what I told her is.
get your certification
exactly.
, in social studies so that you can work at at a public school.
and then she told me.
no Janet was saying that in Ferguson there is gonna be openings for six new teachers in every department.
and I go.
well there is your entry right there.
exactly.
you know.
there's always openings in.
and she said.
yeah but you know I don't wanna work in public schools.
and I go.
well you know what.
if you work in a public school you are gonna make more money than what I'm making right now.
ok.
and I said.
so go ahead.
and start doing that.
and the only way you are gonna get fired is if you do something to one of the kids.
but yes unless you have during the first thirty days or first day they have the option to you know if they see that you you are really bad they can throw you out.
come on.
within the first thirty days.
cuando estábamos en la clase el sábado was talking about that.
he's such a jerk.
it was a teacher.
yeah I know.
I can't stand him.
that there was a teacher.
mmhm.
that they had you know done a whole bunch of things.
I know exactly who they were talking about from you know from the school I was at before.
and I go.
did you get hired somewhere else?
y esa maestra no hacía nada.
se sentaba en la clase tú sabes qué a comer y a organizar la cartera.
er entonces le preguntaba a los muchachos.
are you sick?
are you sick?
and if they were sick and they were out they would ask them.
what did you have?
oh no I you know I I had you know a stomach virus.
oh a stomach virus ok.
she would come back and say.
no she's sick.
and she goes she she would er ask for worker's compensation because she got the stomach virus from a kid in the class.
how do people like that get jobs?
espérate.
that's not the worse.
y se robaba cosas.
ella yo la cogí una vez going through my desk y mirando cosas.
oh that's the one that you caught going through your desk over here?
yeah no not here.
at at at the other one.
at the over right.
right right right.
y ya me lo había dicho mi hermana.
me lo habían dicho varias personas.
cuidado no dejes nada de valor porque ésta se lo lleva.
así que a thief.
er no y todavía está en el sistema.
that's just amazing to me.
y entonces cuando ya had done everything because it takes you have to document those things for a long time.
ok.
cuando ya él lo tenía todo la principal dijo.
no a mí me da.
tú sabes.
era la otra principal no ésta.
ésta la hubiera botado antes you know.
si le caía mal no la hubiera hubiera botado.
that's the thing that's the thing with my school since we work on contract.
you break your contract you're out.
they have to.
here they give you the opportunity to put you on a a an an improvement plan.
and if you don't improve then it takes a long time.
no no I mean here they you know we try to help you out.
a lot of bureaucracy.
you know we'll put a mentor.
we'll give you ideas.
we'll talk to you but if it doesn't improve you're out.
you're out.
I wish they would do that with the kids.
you know.
because the parents in essence sign a contract with you know with the kids when they get there which is the handbook.
you break that you should be out.
right.
oh no no no but the kids continue to go.
you know.
it's just I don't know.
it really bothers me.
I'm looking for a rough year next year I'm telling you.
it's gonna be rough.
I have the teachers on one side expecting me to do everything.
tienes que tú sabes.
I have
I don't know.
invita a a alguna de las celebraciones.
y díselo a sister porque si él le gusta ella y ella y ella.
tú sabes se caen bien.
yeah I'll tell her.
bueno not her I gotta tell sister.
para el año que viene you know to put him on schedule for to go and celebrate mass.
right.
because father Derrik used to bring people all the time but that was him but now father Nichols is going to be doing the same thing so
I'm hungry.
tú no tienes hambre?
I'm still having coffee.
I already had my coffee.
I'm hungry.
ve a buscar algo.
viernes no se puede comer carne.
pastelito de queso?
that sounds pretty good.
de coco?
pero bueno.
estamos conectados.
I guess we could hop in the car with it and go get it.
it's portable.
do you want to?
just hop in the car and go get some pastelitos?

they claim that th they didn't do in vitro.
so what does that have to do with that's nothing to do with in vitro?
in vitro is your own your own genes.
they're fertilized outside and then injected in you.
no.
es que fraternal twins are not common at all.
fraternal twins would.
no what runs in her family are identical twins not fraternal.
fraternal is two eggs getting fertilized separately.
that normally is.
that I know.
and I could be wrong.
I was always heard that the one that runs in the family is the identical.
one egg splits into two.
pero in vitro no significa que no son los genes de ellos.
they take.
outside.
and then they put the embryo in.
hoping it'll take.
which is why people get multiple births.
because normally they don't.
in fact I was watching las noticias.
y había una mujer que salió con identical triplets.
and they did in they did in vitro.
pero ellos no querían multiple kids.
so they only put one egg in.
the thing split.
it's like super rare.
they said.
here we only wanted one kid you know to take it slow.
because that's why you see so many twins now because people do multiple eggs.
and they'll get two boys a boy and a girl two girls whatever it is.
and he said no no no they didn't want that.
le pusieron un solo embryo pa que bueno si cogía bien perfecto.
y cayeron tres idénticos.
tres idénticos.
se le pintan las uñas like each of them have a different colored nail painted so they can tell them apart because they're identical.
tú te imaginas.
y dice el marido.
here they were doing everything right.
we only want one kid.
let's not do them.

I don't really care.
imagínate.
he's only been here.
honestly as long as.
oh I was talking to Chaquita.

so
a month.
yeah.

a month.
who who are you talking about?

no we're talking about that little boy.
oh I'm like who?
he came February second from Cuba.

so he came to like make little friends.
yeah they just landed here.
and already he's learned to play Wii.
they just landed.
and they've been playing for an hour.
yeah Marco turns on the Wii.

I don't think he knows how to play that.
and Marco goes.
of course he does.
and I'm like.
yeah Marco goes.
I taught him!
I taught him!
I taught him.
and you see the little kid.
!
although I'll tell you Marco's Spanish is not that great.
but that's good because.
he really let it go.
but I that's that's normal.
but then on the other hand Tosca's Spanish is much better.
she's also ambidextrous which is interesting.
qué tú quieres bajar?
and then that's also the same thing that I think influences um she has a little bit of dyslexia.
I want to go down.
I want to go down.
oh no.
and I think it's all related.
that's what I think.
do you really think that it's dyslexia?
I mean she's still in the learning phase.
she's still in the learning stage.
yeah but.
I still I mean reverse numbers.
no but like you tell her twenty and she'll put zero two.
mm.
yeah.
and and there's words and stuff that
and she's also fascinated with things that go backwards and forwards.
like she'll take a a piece of paper.
she'll do her homework.
and then she'll flip it over on the backside.
and then everything that the way that it's runs through she'll recopy it all backwards on the other side.
she does it backwards.
oh let me see your?
ah they're from last summer.
they're all.
they're from Bakers?
yes.
I think they came out again because I saw them.

yeah I saw them.

I saw them.
and I was like.
wood shoes for summer.
I love them.
oh my god!
bring them up.

I don't know what they're called.
I'll show them to you right now.
oh my god right now I need them!

I was just talking.
right now I need them!
right now.
you know what they would go great with?
look because look how rat tattered they are.
oh yes they need help.
they would go great with the white dress que mi hija me regaló.
oh my god.
but you know what the problem.
because I think white with
you know what the main problem with the shoes is?
they're too high?
no.
no what?
they're extraordinarily comfortable.
but?
first of all.
and second of all they go with
oh so that's a problem?
they go with my Coach bag.
oh I thought you said.
oh I thought you said were gonna say they go with everything everything.
they go with everything.
they do though because that color's very universal.
they do go with everything.
but they most importantly I have a coach bag that matches.
but don't you think?
I just saw it.
I saw it.
I can't get rid of the shoes.
but they have it they have it again I'm telling you.
I just saw it.
but I have to get them.
don't you think it'll go pretty with that white dress?
I think with white it'll look gorgeous.
oh my god for sure.
oh my god for sure.
it's very summery.
I can't get into the whole white shoe thing.
well I have the white shoes from Nine West.
well though that's really.
and that's the only ones I have.
yeah but that's an exception.
those are the only ones I have.
but other than that really white shoes are for viejas.
ay me has dicho vieja.
no but not those!
how dare you.
no but not those!
no those are very fansy shmansy.
those are spectacular.
those are beyond fansy shmansy.
well anyways so mi viejo calls me today.
bueno so entonces he says and the capitana
he tells me that la capitana threw him under the bus.
but I can't believe that.
in front of everybody.
and he played it off.
whatever I mean things are very sensitive right now at work.
yeah that's super uncool for her to do that in front of everybody too.
uncool on ten different levels.
yeah.
so
cause even if it was it was kidding around or
and that's what I told him.
I said.
why would she do that?
that's completely tacky.
very tacky.
but whatever.
you know what are you gonna do.
so I go.
well you know we'll keep it quiet.
and what did he do?
he freaked the fuck out.
he freaked out.
he played it off.
he neither confirmed confirmed nor denied.
and he just you know
he had a special box.
he left it like that like.
oh well where did you get that from?
and left it at that.
now
oh my god.
the you know so I I I talked to him about it.
but he's so funny because a couple of people have told me that they see him más más embulladito.
like remember this is.
like just in general?
yeah.
this is a very quiet.
hold on.
Lili you wanna go outside?
this is a very quiet guy.
oh no.
you know?
hold on Marta's calling.

he tried the spinach.
he ate cucumbers.
pobrecito.
pobrecito yeah he did.
he wanted to try everything.
that's good.
lo que he did not like ranch.
está peleado con the ranch dressing de mala forma.
he doesn't want to have anything to do with the ranch dressing.
I wonder why.
he calls it la pasta esa.
no he didn't!
that's what he did call it.
he goes.
la pasta esa.
yo no quiero saber nada de la pasta de esa.
ay how funny.
he calls it la pasta esa.
and he will eat the vegetables with out it.
but the ranch dressing ni para ni para.
the ranch is the most.
and to me the ranch is the best thing.
the taste the most pleasing.
bueno dale ok bye.
how funny.
yeah but remember.
he called it la pasta.
but remember they're not.
a mí no me gusta la pasta!
a mí no me gusta la pasta!
but remember
oh there's a new one.
we're supposed to watch it.
oh I haven't seen it.
pero remember he's not accustomed to anything that has seasonings or anything like that.
anything that's out of the norm.
yeah.
because flavors all of that is completely foreign to him.
yeah completely foreign.
I told you.
did you see that his father goes.
oh what what is that?
asparagus.
he's never seen asparagus before in his life.
yeah he goes.
asparagus?
he goes.
oh esa es espinaca?
I'm like.
oh no those are two different animals.
and he goes.
I mean asparagus is a very distinct looking thing.
ay pero pobrecito.
you didn't hear what he said?
you didn't hear what.
he goes.
what?
esa.
pobrecito.
I felt bad for it that he said that.
at least he recognizes that it's true.
awful.
the important thing is is that I think that they all came con los patines puestos.
I don't know if you noticed.
yeah.
the only thing I feel bad because it's the second person already that has put me in that position.
I feel really bad because the other day Antonio calls me.
oye tú que estás en eso.
eh what what can I do?
que I have un pariente that came from Cuba.
and he was a doctor.
and I go to Antonio.
I don't know!
and no I'm gonna tell Antonio.
listen.
that's very cute.
he can take that diploma and shove it up his butt.
because here it's worthless.
here it's worth nothing.
and Antonio goes.
oh my god are you serious?
I go.
yeah Antonio.
I go.
listen.
I'm licensed in the state of Florida.
you have to start over.
Florida.
I'm not licensed anywhere else.
if you move to another state you have to start.
if I go to California.
yeah.
I either have to take the test or hope that my scores are valid enough for that.
take the test.
yeah take the test.
so I'm not even talking about the country.
I'm talking about the frikking state.
the state.
come on.
no you're right.
like I was like and then Antonio se quedaba así.
he goes.
oh my god because what do you think in in the field of medical assistant?
I go.
I'll tell you right now.
look a medical assistant makes the minimum wage.
they work like a dog.
and everybody that came from Cuba is a medical assistant.
and they all think that they're doctors.
and not to be mean or nothing but it's an over eh como se dice like um
está explotado.
it's yes it's an overpopulated field.
it's really
I don't know like.
and I feel really bad.
because Marta's asking me.
and I'm like.
er
bueno Marta er yeah.
or you know.
but I mean the way I see it is.
I mean it's good that they have that that motivation.
if that's what he wants to start with and continue more power to you.
more power to him.
but the.
more power to you.
and I told him.
I go.
the biggest problem you're gonna have is your English.
forget anything else.
the knowledge is there obviously.
but did you notice how he's already uttering words?
that's good though.
I thought that was uh I'm I'm very impressed.
yeah no no no that's very good.
that's why I told him.
I said.
you know right off the bat I could tell that you're the kind of people that are gonna be successful wherever you go.
you're not.
right.
because
yeah and he even asked me to like
so
they are.
cómo.
they are very like.
what do I have to do?
right.
no he was even asking Marta like.
what do I have to do?
where do I have to go?
cómo se dice?
sign me up?
yeah.
yeah.
así que tiene interés.
they have they have interest.
and not just some of them.
but all of them.
like you could tell that.
and you could tell also that he's a modern man.
like.
oh where's your wife?
oh no she's over there
yeah.
signing up for English classes.
oh yeah that's great.
who do you know that comes here a month later and signs up for English classes?
nobody.
for god sakes.
not even young people.
yeah.
that she's been here since she's was twelve eight years later she has nothing to show for it whatsoever except a baby.
yeah.
oh whoopdedoo you know how to lay flat on your back.
yeah you know how to open your legs.
how about that.
good.
how about that.
that's her special talent.
that's her talent.
how about that.
that's her special talent.
dammit I didn't know that was a special talent.
because if I woulda thought that was a special talent I woulda kept on doing it.
America's most talented.
I don't know.
apparently that's a special talent.
well anyways so I told him so a couple of people from work have mentioned que.
oh he's very he's very happy happy and this and that.
Lili I don't know if I can.

and the change in his personality and.

and we should just leave it open I think.
yeah.
ok but

and see if she can open it.
Chaquita!
she can't hear me.

thank you.
because now we're trapped.
look.
and now and mire la was just to stick her head just to have the door open.
sí sí sí just to

oh because she wants to see what's going on.
so ok so says.
oh está muy embullado.
he's a little bit friendlier.
yeah!
está de.
everybody's noticed that he's happier that he's more conversational.
why because he's a little bit
very quiet.
but he was a little bit like serious before.
very serious.
very serious like intimidating serious.
like one of my coworkers is still very like wow.
but then when he stays quiet and he looks at me I wanna like go under the table.

I mean he can be
not just his position but let's let's talk.
part of a group.
he's a writer for god's sakes.
what do you mean he's a writer?
he's written two books already.
published?
apparently not!
oh!
but like books about what like?
but apparently
like like novel or
like I think like novels.
really?
I didn't know that shit.
I I have not had the luxury of reading them.
I would like to.
so would I!
just to see.
he plays three instruments.
I think you told me that.
what are they?
drums bass and guitar.
very interesting.
now I didn't factor in factor in twenty six years of law enforcement with rank at that.
all the percussion percussion.
hello I mean the guy has a hell of a resume.
yeah yeah.
yeah he has
right.
and now and now you you know and now you add the forty five years.
yeah.
you know.
and he pretty much he looks at people that way very
and?
and
he's like Donald's.
and you are?
and you are?
and you're here to see?
right.
and you're lucky if he might even speak to you.
oh my god.
speaking of that you know the other day Tommy and I well we didn't get into a fight or anything but he pretty much told me that I have to change my ways because I'm so harsh and that I don't.
uh oh.
oh we visited this before.
yeah but
and I I almost started crying and everything.
because I was like.
but I don't understand.
how can you say that?
I don't even realize that I'm doing that.
I think I'm much harsher than you are though.
but he says that I'm harsh.
and I thought.
but I don't realize that I'm doing it.
but when are you harsh?
and I even told him.
give me an example so I can cut it out.
I mean I don't know.
uh huh.
but you don't even realize that you're doing it.
and you don't realize the power of your eyes.
you know what you have to do?
and I look at him.
that's what it is!
and I go.
it's the facial expressions.
the power
you know when I was in the academy.
and I go to him.
the power of my eyes!
and he goes.
you could sit there and say.
hi how are you?
but your eyes are saying I don't know what.
your eyes are saying something else.
well I will tell you what.
and I'm like.
but I don't I mean I know when I make faces.
when I was in the academy I used to get in trouble for that.
for making faces.
for making faces.
because it didn't matter if I had learned to shut up.
right and you were smiling yeah.
because my face said it all.
yeah.
I would sit there and go
right.
well that's
and then the instructor would go.
Miss do you have a problem?
and I'd have to go
you know?
no I didn't say anything.
and it didn't matter what I was saying.
because my face was saying something else.
well that's what.
well you don't realize.
so anyways go back to the he tends to look at people like that.
and he does the same thing.
he has this he has this poker face.
I don't think that's a.
is that a bad thing?
I don't know.
he has this poker face all the time.
but he's definitely mastered the art of of being quiet and observing.
well I think and I've I mean I I do this because obviously I think Tommy is much more quiet and observant.
and I think people like that are.
I don't wanna say that they're smarter or more.
I think they're a better judge of character.
it's a talent.
it's a talent.
it's enviable.
it's um
I want to learn.
we can't.
we're too social.
we can.
you know what it is?
but it's not in our nature.
but we can.
but um do you want to?
sometimes.
it's something that I think I wanna I wanna do it.
I like I like to be I like to be Madam Butterfly.
remember that?
no.
remember?
oh Madam butterfly.
Madam butterfly?
I wanna do it.
I want to.
when and and you know what though?
I think that in my job I have to center myself more than in your job.
well yeah even though the other day I told the patient something.
and I was like
as soon as I said it boy I was like didn't do good.
said it.
you were like.
ah ah.
but you know what?
hey.
I said it.
what do you want me to tell you.
oh no no.
what was it?
well it wasn't anything bad.
like now.
ay.
with los viejitos.
I told you that right?
so there's.
you know we've been getting a lot of viejitos.
whatever cool.
pero hay una vieja que es.
pobrecita you know she's alone.
and you know how it is.
so every time that she goes for therapy she'll ask you a thousand and one questions.
pobrecita.
that's her social hour.
that's her social hour.
pero.
you know if you had one patient.
but you have ten fifteen patients going at a time.
pobrecita.
I don't have the time.
and no matter how much I really want to sit there and answer her questions and not be rude I can't sit there and answer especially when they're just redundant questions.
reminds me of something.
go ahead.
when they're just.
oh my god is she really asking me this?
so she starts.
no porque cuando voy voy a ver el médico otra vez.
we've already told you this mind you.
I forgot her name.
fulanita esa te dijo que in four weeks.
pero yo no entiendo.
y si yo me siento mal yo no lo puedo ver antes de las cuatro semanas.
oh my god.
bueno of course.
but do you feel bad?
are you having an emergency?
what's going on?
but they can't stand the limitations.
right.
no no no no no pero imagínate.
porque yo no me siento mejor.
you've come for three sessions.
I don't know what to tell you.
I told her that.
you're not supposed to feel good at this point.
yeah I told her.
tú has venido a tres imagínate.
eso no es magia.
quisiera yo que fuera magia pero no es así.
que yo lo que quiero es ver.
whatever.
she starts giving this whole thing.
resultados.
she wants to see the progress.
yeah yeah.
no and then she tells me.
and they did x rays.
y las placas ya están.
you know how they normally give you like the sheet which the guy the doctor actually has to interpret and say.
we found a fracture.
we found this or whatever.
I go.
no eso se demora una semana.
porque yo quiero ese papel.
so look I go.
for your.
I mean she can get it.
it's her personal records.
and I go.
ok for your records.
no because I have a a friend whose a doctor in Cuba.
aquí no es nada.
pero es un doctor en Cuba.
and he's gonna tell me what I have to do.
and he wants to look at them.
because that just riles me up.
like there is no.
why does that even bother me though?
it bothers me.
it bothers me.
so of course I I did the whole
and I go.
ok.
y qué lo que ese médico te está diciendo?
ese hombre que te está diciendo.
no porque él piensa que me tengo que operar.
I go.
ok the doctor that saw you here is a board certified orthopedic in the state of Florida not in Cuba.
here.
in Cuba!
here.
and he didn't tell you that.
I don't understand.
is it that you want to be operated?
I mean is that.
probably.
yeah.
no I asked her.
I go.
es que lo que tú quieres es operarte.
sí.
yo de verdad que pienso que es la única forma.
I go.
bueno imagínate.
yo creo que entonces está.
and you would think that's a last resort.
that that's something that somebody would wanna avoid.
no.
no.
and ah and so you know.
and I told her.
bueno imagínate.
yo creo que está en un lugar equivocado.
porque cualquier médico que sea bueno lo último aunque sea cirujano lo último que va a hacer es operarte.
porque uno.
even a surgeon.
and you know this very well.
yeah it's the it's the last resort.
they're gonna do all the conservative treatment.
let's do pills.
until
right.
let's do this.
it's the last thing.
the last thing they wanna do is cut you open.
ok.
no especially when it comes to things like that.
it's probably
because that's
yeah and we're not talking a thirty year old woman.
we're talking an eighty year old woman.
you're not removing a tumor.
you're talking about things that are more sensitive where you have the probability que no va a quedar bien.
yeah.
so I told her that.
I told her.
fíjate bien.
y y tú le vas a creer.
and I told her.
and I said.
that's where I pass the line.
I told her.
tú le vas a creer mejor a una persona que no tiene licencia aquí o a una persona que estudió aquí y tiene licencia aquí?
right.
quién tiene más valor?
yeah who do you prefer?
no pero ese hombre es mi amigo.
I go.
no I understand that.
está bien.
I understand that.
and I respect that.
but you have to understand too.
bueno para que fue eso.
and I was like.
oh shoot.
I shouldn't have said that.
because it's not my clinic.
it's not my.
but you know it's like.
listen.
yeah but the ignorance the ignorance is unbarable.
that really riles me.
that really riles me.
the ignorance is unbarable.
and you know but she's an older lady.
so what can you expect.
bueno.
so tell me about the old tell me about the old guy.
mm.
viejo.
so yeah so a lot of people have noticed.
and even we went to have breakfast at a place where we usually eat breakfast by ourselves.
but like.
you and the team?
me and the team.
but he wanted to join us.
oh my god he wants to be buddies with the guys.
well I think.
he's a smart guy.
you know why he's doing that?
no he is.
yeah he's levantando la pata.
but you know why he's doing that?
no he is he's doing the like the dog.
you know why he's doing that?
no but not only that.
not only that.
he's marking the territory.
but not only that.
I can't beat them.
I mean not that they have anything where.
so I'm gonna join them.
I'm gonna join it.
I'm gonna let them know that I'm one of them.
I'm gonna let them know that I'm their friend.
and that everything's good.
and they're gonna take care of her for me.
yeah they're taking care of
because they like me.
right.
and I'm the daddy.
mmhm yeah he's very smart.
and I'm the daddy.
I'm the daddy.
no he's beyond brilliant.
that's funny.
ok so you go to have breakfast.
yeah let me tell you.
and the waitress takes it off.
he suites me.
I mean.
bueno it turns out that the waitress has a crush on him.
how do you know that?
bueno short of taking off her clothes and sitting on his lap?
no!
para qué?
she couldn't even take our order right.
oh my.
I've never seen her that enthralled by someone.
that excited.
that excited.
oh excited with.
oh my god ella está
yeah.
loca!
and when I told her.
oye ese es mi novio.
she probably thought you were kidding.
I came back in the afternoon.
she probably thought you were kidding.
no it took me like twenty minutes to convince her.
no no espérate.
she probably thought you were kidding.
let me rewind.
no no wait.
start the story from the beginning.
ok so we get to breakfast.
she can't even take the order.
even J d and Carlos were like.
métete en la cocina por dios.
por dios!
make us a coffee!
they were they were screaming.
and they were like.
my god what is wrong with this woman?
qué pena.
they were embarrassed for her.
they were like.
we've never seen you like this.
and I was like.
oh my god you're not kidding.
this woman has a crush on you.
oh my god.
and he told me.
because he had been there before.
and he had sensed it.
we go there all the time.
Sergio's.
yeah but him him.
yeah he goes there all the time.
we go there all the time.
everybody goes there ok.
everybody goes there all the time.
that's the hangout.
so he had kinda sensed it.
and he was like.
oh my god.
no ella está enamorada.
but she's like an older lady?
yeah well she's about his age.
his age.
ok but she's Cuban.
yeah.
and she looks not great.
she's no she's Columbian or something.
I'm like
ok but she doesn't look great.
she looks like she looks like her age or probably even more.
she looks her age or maybe a little more.
ok yeah.
yeah yeah.
and it's so funny.
because he tells me.
he goes.
oh because you look twenty.
he goes he goes.
you don't look thirty five.
you look more like twenty five.
you know?
and he goes he goes.
oh and there when we must go out people look people stare at you.
and they must wonder.
what is that girl doing with that viejo.
he must be loaded.
he must be loaded.
that's the sugar daddy.
because you know I say that too.
when I see like a young girl or a younger girl with a guy.
yeah but I don't think he looks that much older than I yeah.
no I know but
and I don't
and I guess at the end of the day I don't realize that I I really don't look my age.
but
yeah that's the thing.
you think.
no I'm thirtyfive.
I'm fine with it whatever.
I think I'm fine.
yeah.
you think that everybody because you know me and we all look the same.
in my age group.
right.
we all look the same.
but when you meet.
because I know it happens to you.
right.
today mismo.
I did an evaluation on a man.
pobrecito he's only been here seven months from Cuba.
uhuh.
and you know over there they just don't got the nutrients and stuff right.
so they don't look good.
so I'm evaluating this man.
tenido.
mind you I I just get his name and his diagnosis.
I'm not looking at his age.
fractured wrist.
I start talking to him.
the man starts.
no porque llevo siete meses.
still not looking at his age.
mmhm.
I did everything I could to him.
mmhm.
and you're thinking he's in his forties.
after.
I'm thinking he's pushing fifty.
yeah.
after he leaves.
he's thirty.
I go to write his paperwork.
born in nineteen seventy two.
yeah.
and I go like this.
oh my god.
yeah.
and Roger's behind me.
and I go.
oh my god.
and Roger goes.
what happened?
and I go.
Roger did you see that gentleman that just left?
a new guy.
and he goes.
yeah.
I go.
guess what year he was born?
Roger was born in nineteen seventy.
and he goes.
I don't know.
I go.
seventy two.
he goes.
oh my god that man's my dad's age.
oh my god!
I go.
I know right?
I go.
are we totally like our our perception is out there?
because you know we think that we're cool we're young and hip.
no as far as I'm concerned I'm cool and hip.
because everybody that you know that's your age more or less fits the bill I think.
I don't know but
so when you see someone It's like short.
but I mean think of it.
does that happen to you with the shortness?
like I I know that I'm short.
but I don't realize it until.
I I think I'm big.
until either I'm standing next to someone very tall or I see someone very short.
like the other day I was in Publix.
and I I just cracked myself up.
I was there pushing my little cart.
and from a distance there was a.
she must have been Philapino or something.
the lady was like this tiny.
yes I saw one in the mall yesterday.
she was like this tiny.
yes.
and as I'm pushing the cart.
mind you she's far away.
and I go.
short.
she's very short.
and I'm doing the whole to myself.
yeah yeah yeah.
as soon as I walked by her she was still shorter than me.
but couple of inches.
but not that much.
mmhm.
and I thought.
oh my god is that what I look like pushing the frikking Publix cart?
because I don't feel that that's what I look like.
I feel that I'm walking around very tall and proud.
well I think I'm tall until Kathy comes over.
right mm yeah.
she's eleven.
yeah.
and then you go.
yeah.
yup.
and you're taller than
right.
yeah.
right.
and and I really I do think I'm I'm big.
and it's funny.
because people at work think I'm big too.
well because I think either they know you already.
they don't associate.
that's something that somebody somebody used to tell me all the time.
or your personality.
whenever and and as a matter of fact I get that comment a lot.
and I even get it from Frank.
and Frank's only like five eight five nine.
he's five eight five nine.
yeah.
maybe no maybe he's maybe he's like between five nine and five ten.
a little smaller.
yeah he's not
no.
he's average.
normal.
yeah he's normal.
but for me that's super tall.
yeah for
because
well not really.
Jeff was six something.
four.
but even when I put on my big six inch heals I'm still only five six.
that was extreme too.
so he's five ten so I'm good.
yeah it doesn't
no it's still good right.
but it's funny how people who know me and even people who know me who see me every day now that he gets to stand up close to me and put his arms around me and he says things like.
wow you're really tiny.
and I'm like.
yeah.
you know.
I'm only five feet tall.
right.
and he's like.
oh my god.
he's like in shock.
and I don't wear heels to work any more.
I wear sneakers.
yeah.
but I think it's
your presence.
I think it's attitude.
it's presence.
yeah.
your presence.
people think people think you're taller.
yeah.
but
right.
you're short.
and I think it has to do with if you're used to seeing someone in cariño.
I think
it's like um
I swear I'm big.
it's kind of like with Andrew.
I know Andrew's huge.
but I've known him for so long.
it doesn't shock me any more.
it doesn't surprise me any more.
mmhm.
it's normal.
it's
yeah me either.
you know what I mean?
yeah it's.
it's almost kinda like it's normal.
now if someone points it out to you.
you go.
oh yeah yeah.
ah whatever.
mmhm.
or maybe you see someone out in the street.
and maybe they're not even as fat as him.
and you go.
oh my god that person's huge.
oh my god that person's huge.
you're right.
why is that?
es cariño.
I think it's just you get used to it.
wow you're right.
right?
no you're right.
because you see Andrew.
and you know he's a big guy.
no but you're right.
but you you you get over it really quick.
but you're used to it.
yeah.
he's a big guy.
you just say he's a big guy.
he's a big guy.
yeah you get over it.
and then you see some really fat guy.
and you go.
wow that guy's fat.
oh wow that guy's huge!
and then you sit there and go.
oh.
but no.
well
so oh my god.
mm.
so let's go back.
I don't know if the story.
but I'm gonna say it anyways.
ok.
I think I told you that Tommy's friend that really tall guy.
the gringo.
the awkwardly
that well.
is he a gringo?
well he's not gringo.
no he's not.
he just looks gringo.
he's
right.
he saw Jana.
and he was all about
and he bought her the Coach thing.
yes.
ok.
so we went to the Heat game.
and the whole thing right.
ok very good.
then a couple of days later.
what does he do again?
he
no.
by no means.
he's eating a cable.
he's comiendose un cable.
mmhm.
like J d says.
yeah yeah.
yeah he's in the cable.
la rata la rata comiéndose cable.
he's in the.
he's in the cable.
pero espérate.
why would he buy her such a gift then?
it was ten dollars.
I mean it normally runs like twenty or thirty.
but I guess he went to see all of it.
it's still a cute little gift.
ok.
I mean it was it was a very cute sign.
that is cute.
it was very cute ok.
so this is the thing.
so about a week after the Heat game whatever he calls up Tommy.
hey I'm gonna do a barbecue in my house so everyone can come over and hang out.
mmhm.
and Tommy.
what does she say about him?
does she like?
so Tommy goes.
ok yeah we'll be there.
so Tommy hangs up the phone and tells me.
oh my god this guy's gonna do a barbecue at his house.
and I go.
ok so what's the problem?
Tommy has been to his house one or two times previously when the guy was still married mind you.
mmhm.
oh I remember this situation.
that the house was super tiny.
that they don't clean up.
and it was really piggy.
right it was really piggy whatever.
so Tommy tells me.
oh my god this guy's gonna do a barbecue.
imagínate tú.
and me da pena.
I'm not gonna tell him no.
what am I gonna tell him.
is he living alone now?
he's living alone but in the same house.
because it's his dad's house.
so the chick left.
with the kids.
right.
where did they go?
he has the kids.
I don't know where she went.
but whatever.
so anyway.
ella es gringa también?
no she's Hispanic.
she's hispanic.
oh.
so he isn't.
why do I think that he's un gringo?
he's Cuban.
he's Cuban.
he's Cuban.
he's Cuban.
he's just blond and blue eyed.
ok.
or green eyes.
so anyways.
so Tommy says.
oh my god I'm not gonna tell him.
qué pena.
que no.
you know.
I can't go to your house.
because you're a pig or whatever.
and I'd much less eat there.
so
oye send Mona before.
yeah yeah listen.
oh my god.
you need a help.
so anyways.
so of course he calls Jana.
inviting her over.
so she goes.
this is where the whole I turned into.
that's what Marie tells me.
she goes.
oh my god but you've turned into.
I called Jana.
and I go.
hey are you gonna go?
and she goes.

I go.
ok great.
I'll meet you there.
we're gonna go like around three or four.

no.
not really.
this was briefly after the whole Heat game.
ok.
so
it's those back there.
yeah.
I'm not about to call it a humane
on the way.
Owen tells me every day.
por qué tú no llamas al animal control?
yeah that's really sad.
ay but at the end of the day you know it's just not in my nature.
you know what's gonna happen yeah.
ay.
so ok so I tell Jana.
listen I'm gonna be there like between three or four.
it's a barbecue whatever.
ok what are you gonna wear?
and I told her.
I actually thought of wearing like one of my cute summer dresses.
but at the end of the day it's this guy's house.
whatever I think I'm just gonna wear little bermudas.
and you know call it a day.
oh I just got this little um like summer dress from Old navy.

I do this.
and I tell her.

I can't frikking believe this.
bueno.
sure enough I I tell this guy.

pero what's your problem?

she doesn't know this guy.
she doesn't know him.

so then Tommy goes.
oh ok whatever just drop it.
bueno.
so we go back outside.
I get a beer.
I'm like.
you know what?
let me just go outside and do my.
I'm gonna relax.
pobrecita the dog is a puppy.
it's barely a year old.
and it's a super hyper active dog.
now it's imagínate it lives in an apartment.
so now it's in a backyard the size of I don't even know who.
and it's going crazy.
and she brought it little toys to play which ok is understandable.
but now the dog wants to play.
now the dog wants to play fetch and catch and the whole thing.
I'm not gonna play with the dog fetch and catch.
I came to a barbecue to have.
no right.
yeah.
right.
right.
so now the dog is.
you know I can't blame the dog.
mmhm.
the dog brings the little ball the little bone.
it wants to do this.
mmhm.
it wants to do that.
and I'm like.
listen.
get away from me.
me estás aho ahora mismo hablando de cuál versión de la ecuatoriana o la colombiana?
la de los colombianos dicen que los estuvieron siguiendo en caliente.
ya.
que por eso no se dieron cuenta.
y tuvieron que seguir pasar el límite de porque estaban en una persecución prácticamente en el momento en que pasaba.
y no lo podían dejar escapar al tipo.
los estaban siguiendo.
pero los terroristas estaban en Ecuador?
supuestamente cruzaron.
la versión colombiana es que estaban en Colombia.
y de Colombia pasaron a Ecuador.
that's what they say.
that's that's what Colombia say.
but cuando tú hablas con la gente de Ecuador Ecuador dice.
no.
por qué?
porque cuando fueron a ver todo lo que pasó después del bombardeo cuando ya vieron a la gente que estaba prácticamente muerta o laying on on en en el piso supuestamente estaban en ropa de dormir.
mmhm.
ok.
cómo tú puedes pensar que los estás siguiendo de un país a otro en ropa de dormir?
la versión del Ecuador es que ellos estaban camping en el territorio ecuatoriano.
ok.
y que los colombianos cruzaron la frontera.
y los bombardearon cuando ellos estaban durmiendo.
excuse me los qué?
los colombianos.
no antes de eso.
hmm?
algo tú dijiste una palabra que no la entendí.
cuál de todas?
dijiste una palabra que no la entendí.
bueno la cosa es que esa es la versión que dicen los colombianos.
la versión de los ecuatorianos pues es esa de que ellos estaban durmiendo.
ya.
entonces existe lo que es.
gracias a dios después de todo el bombardeo que hubo pudieron calcular una computadora.
que yo creo que para mí esa es la razón por la cual cuando vino la la reunión de Río que estuvieron todos los presidentes Uribe tenía todos los papeles y todos los ases debajo de la manga.
por eso es que tu querido presidente Correa tuvo que morderse la lengua.
el tuyo.
morderse la lengua y decir que está bien que se acababa el conflicto.
lo mismo que Chávez y lo mismo que nuestro gran amigo Noriega.
mm.
ok.
esa es la versión que supuestamente se baraja.
so se puede interpretar como que el laptop que supuestamente encontraron que dijeron que había evidencia que comprobaba que Ecuador tenía vínculos con las Farc era verídico.
las Farc.
exactamente.
por eso fue entonces que el presidente se hizo el loco.
claro porque tú sabes cómo es Correa.
ya.
Correa considera que es el dueño de la palabra.
y la Onu prácticamente lo dijo.
Colombia no tenía por qué traspasar Ecuador.
correcto.
aun así que estaba siguiendo a un terrorista como Reyes que era la primera o la segunda cabeza de Farc.
y ahorita cambiando tú tienes tu licencia con residence verdad?
no why?
no tienes tu licencia?
no no here.
con el address de aquí.
no.
de seguro.
ah mi tía.
ya.
no but she's changing.
why why you need it?
ya no tiene que.
necesitaba que votaras por mi jefe.
that's is the letter that's is the sign you have
ah pero mi tía no es ciudadana.
no no todavía le falta.
hmm yeah.
I'm working for este Antonio López.
que está lanzándose para commissioner.
de la ciudad de Miramar.
no.
entonces me interesa que gane para que pueda seguir manteniendo su oficina.
desafortunadamente republicano.
no.
no yo con los republicanos no voy.
no voy ni a misa.
ni a misa voy con los republicanos.
bueno entonces eso fue lo que pasó.
tú tú no viste lo que lo que Correa le hizo a Uribe?
se levantó.
prácticamente lo dejó con la boca abierta.
y el señor Uribe para mí un señor le dijo.
no.
si el presidente del Ecuador no está enfrente mío no voy a decir absolutamente nada.
y lo esperó.
y lo esperó.
y cuando Correa se sentó Uribe habló.
y Uribe fue un caballero porque cuando este señor este el de el de República Dominicana le pidió que por favor pues trataran de llegar a un consenso Uribe fue quien se levantó y le dio la mano a a tu presidente Correa.
mhmm.
es más presidente tuyo que mío.
no hermana yo considero que ese no es no es mi no es mi línea en el país.
y tú sabes lo que hizo con el asunto de las herencias?
no.
tú tienes un problemita también ahí.
por qué?
está aplicando un un porcentaje un impuesto del treinta y cinco por ciento.
sí?
de herencias.
por ejemplo God forbid something happen to to your mom.
mmhm.
y tú tienes por ejemplo digamos ciento cincuenta mil en bienes.
aquí o allá?
allá porque tú tienes que heredarlos allá.
ok.
oh claro.
antes de tú recibirlos tienes que pagarle al gobierno el treinta y cinco por ciento.
se lo coge el gobierno.
why?
porque ese es un un impuesto que el señor Correa le ha puesto a los pelucones.
y qué es?
y te consideras pelucona porque tienes una herencia de más de ciento cincuenta mil dólares.
so si lo queremos interpretar cuál sería el income limit para hacer considered?
ciento cincuenta mil a doscientos mil.
y ya eres pelucona?
si es menos
it's just menos de menos de eso no hay problemas.
puedes recibir la herencia.
pero si tienes un dólar más de eso te antes estaba aplicando el setenta por ciento.
y todo el mundo prácticamente se puso en contra.
y supuestamente bajó al treinta y cinco por ciento.
pero todo es por la gente de dinero.
eso me lo dijo María.
pero.
pero todavía no es
no ya está aprobado.
señorita está aprobado así que póngase pilas.
wow.
póngase pilas porque la cosa está seria.
estaba hablando con mi hermano también.
y también le estaba con que le quería comentar eso a mi tía Carla por los muchachos.
sobre todo ella que tiene muchos millones en propiedades en Ecuador.
el edificio hermana que yo creo que tiene un buen valor.
en el edificio.
y es treinta y cinco por ciento estamos hablando de un buen billete hermana.
estamos hablando de cuánto en doscientos mil?
estamos hablando de cuarenta?
un poquito más sesenta.
ciento cincuenta mil el diez por ciento son quince.
son quince y quince cuarenta cinco cincuenta como cincuenta mil.
el veinte son treinta.
oh no!
es mucho dinero.
y tú sabes lo que a mí me dijo Clara que me prácticamente me dio ese ese advice que se están haciendo como una especie de inmobiliaria todo lo que son los bienes.
como aquí un incorporated.
exactly.
that's the best thing to do it to deal with that.
that's the way you do it here.
ya.
in order to pay less taxes that I didn't know what I'm gonna do is you can incorporate yourself tú puedes ser por decirte Ana López inc.
y pagas el cincuenta por ciento de los impuestos.
en vez de pagar lo que uno paga normalmente.
coño que me sacan bastante.
I know.
me sacan bastante esos hijos de su madre.
so that's the best way to go about it.
you incorporate yourself as a person as your whole name.
even though you have a W two and you're working for a like an employee?
no no no that's in the case that you have a business.
that's in case like if you have a business.
and you're taking tax write off.
yeah ok.
like not W two.
yeah but por ejemplo for example María.
she can do it.
I don't know about her.
if she wants.
con los extranjeros si no no no te podría decir.
because in this year when we made the taxes for her she have a
she has to pay?
she have a nine thousands.
cómo se dice la palabra en English?
cuál?
en contra.
negative.
a a negative.
nine thousands five hundred something.
so good she doesn't have to pay.
no that's good for for her para
she has lost a lot of equity.
I was looking into the community where she bought.
ajá.
what does she have a three two or two two?
three.
three two.
I think she paid like three hundred thousand.
and I think know if she's lucky.
two forty.
between two forty and two sixty.
yeah I know.
I know that.
I know that.
I'm.
I know it's bad.
for her because she tried.
sad.
but I I give it to her the advise to waiting one more year to see what happens.
she has to wait at least two more years.
mírala.
yeah but I don't I don't supposed to tell her that her husband.
oh did you see the listing I sent you?
yeah.
yeah but tú sabes qué?
el problema de aquí que no me gustan son los taxes is too high.
Miramar is too high.
I see.
is too high.
I thinking maybe I don't know un poquito más arriba.
siempre por lo general el impuesto es del dos por ciento.
por decirte si te compras ciento ciento cuarenta son dos mil ochocientos menos el home exemption unos dos mil cuatrocientos dos mil trescientos.
son doscientos dólares en taxes mensuales.
yeah but when you try to find out the the how much you are supposed to pay for the homeowners insurance insurance.
bueno un un condo y todo eso ya viene incluida la asociación.
yeah I know.
no es aparte.
I know but de todas maneras.
es fácil.
entre taxes y homeowners a lo que sea tu mortgage agrégale trescientos o cuatrocientos dólares facilito.
que es el el homeowners insurance y todo.
pero eso añadido a todo a todo.
do you know how much they pay just for the?
they paying.
assessment.
even they no paying?
November two thousand six?
how much?
five thousand nine hundred.
es que esa comunidad ha habido demasiado vandalism.
two ninety five two eighty eight every month.
yeah but not only that.
pero since she was behind.
she had to pay attorney's fees.
one thousand one hundred and fifty el abogado este.
that's why.
no se mató nadie?
este el abogado estaba muy muy bonito para que estuvimos in Plantation donde el lawyer.
y para qué nos trataron muy bien.
you cannot stop it.
you cannot do it that.
so.
y entonces ah el abogado que fuiste a ver si.
si para que la oficina y todo la gente al principio todos estaban como un poquito tú sabes pensando que ellos no querían pagar.
mmhm mmhm.
pero nada que ver el el veterano se paró.
José bien parado el hombre.
tiene su carácter.
y mis respetos para él.
me dijo.
usted no me puede a mí decir ni culparme porque es un pago automático de un banco que yo ni siquiera puedo ver desde mi país.
una cuenta que yo tengo ahí.
y que supuestamente ustedes deben sacar el dinero automáticamente.
no fue mi culpa.
y no fue mi problema porque yo no vivo aquí.
mmhm.
y yo vengo una vez por por año.
mmhm.
y le dijo.
yo no estoy.
yo no estoy.
me dice.
negando la la responsabilidad de pagar.
yo te quiero pagar.
le dijo.
y yo no me voy a ir de aquí si usted me dice que no porque esto va a seguir con va a seguir subiendo.
yo quiero pagar.
y quiero pagarle ahora.
el abogado subió.
el abogado subió entró otra vez.
trajo un papel.
se lo hizo firmar.
y le condonaron los intereses.
sí?
sí.
le condonaron los intereses.
lo que no pudimos condonar fue el fee del del abogado.
ah sí no de eso forget it.
eso sí fue imposible.
attorney fee and everything te lo digo por experiencia propia.
yo perdón.
yo pagué unos meses acumulados.
y de los attorney's fees no me salvó nadie.
no nadie.
pero solamente thanks good it was only a hundred and fifty dollars.
no but a hundred and fifty is nothing.
it's nothing compare to one thousand whatever.
one thousand and something.
yeah that's a lot of money.
no.
pero.
it happens.
so vamos a ver qué pasa con el market.
I hope things change.
no pero supuestamente están haciendo algunos este van a hacer algunos correctivos.
aparte de los que ya hicieron.
están promoviendo una ley para ayudar a toda la gente porque es demasiado la gente que se va a poner en foreclosure.
solamente en la ciudad de Miramar hay mil hasta el mes pasado mil novecientas casas ya en foreclosure.
before foreclosure pero ya.
sí.
ya al momento al instante ya.
no pero las estadísticas son peores para este año.
la cantidad es estratosférica.
eso va a hacer.
y eso ya va a hacer hasta el año.
pienso yo hasta el dos mil nueve.
es que estamos en época de elecciones.
en época de elecciones para cualquier país tomar alguna decisión o tomar algún buen rumbo no es difícil.
hasta que no se sepa quién va a ser la cabeza que se sienta en enero.
mmhm.
hasta que más o menos no coja las las riendas estamos hablando de junio del dos mil nueve.
hasta ver qué pasa.
definitivamente.
y yo creo que si se ponen como están las cosas McClain o no creo que Barack Obama gane.
me parece imposible que que gane.
pero yo.
tú fuiste la que mandaste el el el email que decía que él es terrorist.
email.
músulman musulmán.
cómo era la palabra que me dijiste?
ya se me olvidó vieja.
pero lo que sí te digo es que dicen no sé lo leí que cuando él hizo un juramento o algo porque él no estaba aquí estaba afuera él hizo un juramento en el corán.
no lo hizo en la biblia.
y que el padre que era que era este no sé de qué parte de allá es lo dejó al año.
y luego la mujer se casó con otro también.
y él estuvo en en en universidades y estuvo en colegios de los extremistas.
mmhm.
él no estuvo en ninguna ni ni católica ni ni de aquí tampoco.
ninguna cristiana.
y que realmente él él tiene to tiene todo ese tipo de religión.
no sé pues la religión que se llama la de las que ellos usan los extremistas.
no la recuerdo bien.
pero él tiene muy poco.
él es muy joven comparado a la experiencia de Hillary que tiene treinta y cinco años.
la experiencia de McClain que tiene veinticinco.
aunque es más viejo se piensa que debería tener más experiencia.
Hillary la tiene más que él.
él lo que es político.
y Barack Obama este y Barack Obama es muy joven apenas creo que no llega ni a diez ni a quince años a veinte años.
sí.
y además lo que es lo que es su imagen lo que es su imagen internacional no tiene el el carisma que tiene la Hillary Clinton a nivel internacional.
más sin embargo mucha gente la critica.
y me da pena.
el problema es que se critica porque es mujer.
y porque es mujer se considera que involucra las emociones.
y para hacer para hacer un presidente no puedes involucrar las emociones.
debes ser pragmático.
y ese es el gran defecto de las mujeres.
pero considero también que si tú le pones unas pocos de emociones a las decisiones de las personas que han llegado a este país que en la mayoría perdón al mundo que han sido hombres creo que obtendríamos un mejor mundo que el que tenemos ahora.
y para mí yo sí creo que este país merece una mujer como presidente.
yo sí creo.
y esta señora tiene las credenciales.
tiene todo.
lo malo de ella fue el llantito ese que hizo al principio de las elecciones que fue lo que prácticamente pues la la desdibujó un poco en el aplomo que que usó cuando pasó lo del marido con la la Mónica.
mmhm.
eso fue lo que la empezó como quien dice a desbaratar.
y y aparte pues el a Omaba también lo molestó en parte lo del lo de su inexperiencia en lo que más le han dado más fuerte.
go ahead.
ay sí.
ya.
vamos a ver qué pasa con las elecciones porque de todas maneras por último lo que más da pena es el futuro de los niños.
que ultimadamente ya uno viejo como sea pues
yeah.
ya la vida está hecha.
pero vamos a ver qué pasa.
oye.
tell me.
tú que pasas metida in the internet all day.
oh yeah yeah.
I'm looking for something con las tres bees bueno bonito y barato.
in what category?
which one?
vacation.
I wanna go to the Caribbean or
but how plane?
whatever whatever is a good deal.
for all four of us it's the first time that we're all going on vac.
well not the first time.
no you are always on vacation with the kids please tell me.
no no but I wanna take them to the Caribbean because Mariela is always telling me.
she has this girl in school that is her same age.
ajá.
mmhm.
and she tells me that um.
oh my friend Aby that she she tells me that she's been on a cruise.
and I can't wait to go on a cruise.
and I always wanted to be in in a cruise.
and I can't wait to go on a cruise.
wait wait wait wait back time you don't go went with the babies before?
on the cruise no not on the cruise.
you left the baby here.
yeah.
oh.
no last year we went to New York and I took them.
Nueva York yeah we went together.
yeah no but went I've been going to the Caribbean.
and into Las Vegas I went only with Alberto.
so I wanna take them this year.
I was also waiting for the baby to be older.
yeah that's the best time for him.
which makes it easier for all of us.
even though I don't think he's ready yet.
but I'm gonna take him now.
you have to be watching him.
he can jumping easily.
yeah I know that's why I was thinking maybe maybe we can take like maybe like another.
you know my brother's working in the Caribbean.
yeah he's working in the Caribbean.
he flies like every three weeks.
he goes to Costa Rica.
or he goes to Mexico because he's you know he's a mortgage broker.
ajá.
what he's doing is he's doing loans but in the Caribbean.
ok.
these properties are like one million and up.
pero son propiedades un sueño.
so when he stays there I can easily go.
yeah.
so I have to pay just the airfare.
but why you don't try with Spirit.
they have good deals pero.
eighteen thirty four.
they have even nine dollars.
but they catch you on the taxes.
or they catch you on the on the way back.
like they give you an eight dollar ticket to go there.
and then?
pero con los impuestos and then the ticket coming back.
lets just say that the going tickets is eight dollars.
and then the return is like a hundred and twenty plus two fifty in the taxes.
ya son three hundred dollars.
three hundred and something.
times four.
no that's twelve hundred.
that's too much.
that's what I'm saying.
since you're always on the internet if you see something you know reasonable.
you know what?
I know June to to November on the hurricane season easily you can find less than two hundreds and fifty.
not really because it's it's it's on vacation time.
it's peak time.
it's summer time.
no but the problem is you have to buy six months before.
and then you gonna catch the good deal.
I've been looking for something.
because that's what.
for a while.
a with María we're talking about when there are coming next year.
we're gonna go to a a cruise.
and we're gonna try to buy it maybe on June or July.
and we're suppose to go on when they come in February two thousand nine with
I wish with my aunty.
but I you know her.
she is very scared with the cruise.
really?
yeah.
why?
she don't like it.
she doesn't like it.
I heard your mommy is coming next week.
yeah on Monday.
I'm gonna go with her to the home speed way.
a Homestead?
Homestead Speedway it's a racing
ay no le va a dar dolor de cabeza.
no no because we're going to the V I P.
why you're gonna take her there?
it's for the company.
the insurance company we have a big party there.
and we're gonna met everyone there.
I've been.
I've been I've been there when it's cuando Alberto trabajaba en Coca Cola.
no te he contado.
yeah what?
Carlos got a new job.
ya me dijo mi tía.
sí.
Telemundo.
what are he's gonna do there?
it's good for him?
bueno.
Telemundo?
bueno no.
él va a ser empleado de General Electric.
oh.
he is gonna be an employee for General Electric.
but he's gonna be working for Msnbc.
oh that's that's that is a big name.
yeah.
I like that.
so he is a General General Electric employee.
Telemundo.
pero he is gonna be working for M S N B C Telemundo.
ah he like that.
of course.
of course.
he's very happy.
no te digo.
it's a good base salary.
and you know they they give them up to twenty thousands dollars in bonus which is not bad.
pero tiene sus pros y sus cons.
which one is the problem.
the problem is that they don't give him a car.
so he needs to get another car.
yeah but he gonna more income right?
yeah more income.
but at the same time it's an extra expense that we have never had never.
it's like having.
the way I see it it's like.
oh my god they just throw us a baby in the house are you gonna take care of diapers formula because it's a insurance gas maintenance.
everything.
eso es lo que me tiene medio
pero cuál están en comprar.
no ahorita la verdad es no no sabes que
el problema es que.
no lo quiero ni pensar.
pero el problema es el tipo de trabajo que tiene.
no puede manejar cualquier carrito mamita.
tampoco lo no lo va poder manejar un mercedes ni un carro tampoco de lujo.
ya pero imagen es imagen.
no matter what.
so vamos a ver.
en eso estamos.
así que si escuchas de algún good deal because en el dealer donde él está hay carros.
pero so un Lexus o el equivalente.
yo tengo una amiguita que es dueña de un dealer.
si quieres ir de a verla.
es amiga mía.
la dueña dueña.
es un es un dealer grande.
tiene three warehouse.
en here close here.
sí?
sí si quieres la puedes ir a visitar.
where?
está en ahí en.
pero qué pasó con el marido de la Ana?
está en Infinity?
y por qué no intentas?
Infinity?
no pero acuérdate que ella se compró un Mazda allá.
es para él.
she make a good deal.
to that effect que se compre mejor un Lexus donde él está pues.
ya pareces cubana chica.
so.
money money money.
it's either money or credit and
no pero.
the credit is not all that.
pero why don't they give it to him a a car?
because they offering him a big salary.
and he decide to go with the money and no with the car.
of course.
sometimes you gotta give up certain things.
yeah I know.
yeah but that's.
like all the jobs that he's had they they's always giving him like you know company car.
but now they're not giving him a car but they're giving him a good salary.
so we'll see what happens.
but if you hear something good too you let me know.
but I whish one you wanna find it?
eso es lo que quiero saber.
qué quieres buscar?
whatever you know just let me know.
whatever you hear.
whatever.
oh speaking about that Victor no se puede hacer nada.
no?
I've got a this week.
it's impossible.
pobre muchacho.
because they're gonna ask at the time their closing they need to see the original driver's license.
ya.
me lo dijeron.
me lo dijo un un cliente que que fue a la oficina.
y le pregunté el caso no?
entonces le dije.
mira tengo este caso.
y me dice.
flaca la copia no le va a servir.
al momento del cierre.
necesita al momento del cierre.
he's suppose to go there.
not only that because I can send a to his house.
that's not the problem.
the problem is that the person who is closing needs to see the I D.
ya.
ya.
está jodido el tipo pobrecito.
he's a very good guy.
it's a very good.
I know.
I feel bad for him.
but unfortunately I can.
I tried mira que yo he tratado.
I tried.
pero bueno no se puede no se puede.
es en la primera vez que lo tocaron en mil ochocientos seis.
uhuh.
se oyó y ninguno le gustó.
sí.
y ah y lo tocaron entre otras piezas.
como él tenía esa costumbre de tener tanto material para tocar.
y entonces después dice.
el con el con siempre ha venido a largo tiempo.
después de su primera creación empezó a estabilizarse cuando ya tenía trece años Joseph Joachim.
era una persona que conocía Beethoven.
que Beethoven conocía.
en memoria a
o lo tocó de memoria en Londres por primera vez en mil ochocientos cuarenta y cuatro.
y Mendelssohn estaba ahí.
el la composición es increíblemente asociada a Joachim porque la tocó ahí primero la primera vez.
pero Huberman Adolf Busch Szigeti Milstein Hogan Hermann y otros y y no menos.
pero de todas maneras es el concierto más difícil de tocar.
Bueno ese ese según según ese escritor.
pero hay hay otros escritores que han dado opiniones.
lo que sucede es esto.
era que muchos de esas Beethoven puso una música diferente a la de su tiempo.
y él rompió el el el el ritmo la o la las impresiones.
él él salió de de lo clásico a lo romántico.
él fue el primer romántico.
en en y y muchas de sus especialmente en su período en su del medio segundo período de composición.
él empezó a crear cosas diferentes a lo que lo que Mozart y Haydn habían hecho anteriormente.
y él empezó a crear cosas románticas él.
por eso se le considera a él el el más el primer romántico.
porque.
y nada de romántico tiene la cara esa de ese hombre.
pero y y recuerda que ya a ese momento empezó él empezó a a a estar tener problema con el oído.
que él empezó a a a ensordecer o a tener que ya no podía escuchar bien las cosas.
claro a lo último las composiciones del tercer período de su.
ellos dicen aquí que el el el caso de que abre con una como como un tímpano.
a se haya ha creado muchas preguntas particularmente vistas en contraste con el liricismo.
pero vamos a ver qué dice el.
dónde está el otro?

y tengo que seguir en español.
lo que pasa es que estoy traduciendo de una página a la otra.
sí bueno aún aquí lo aquí dice también de de de su principio cuando él la primera vez que lo el él recibió mucha crítica.
para mí francamente cuando yo lo pongo las primeras cinco notas lo que yo recuerdo es Mozart.
sí porque tenía la influencia de Mozart él.
en un momento oscuro yo puedo o o o equivocarme si es Mozart o o o es Beethoven.
y.
y él claro el el piano era su su instrumento favorito.
pero el violín llegó a ser su segundo instrumento.
pero cuando él componía muchas muchas piezas de lo que lo más lo que cuando él estaba más serio en cuanto a composición era cuando componía los cuartetos para para instrumentos de de cuerda.

yo creo que la tienen en todo disco de toda clase para todo el mundo.
ese ese Paul Potts y la persona de Inglaterra.
yo no lo conozco.
él es de Inglaterra?
sí.
y cantó en uno de sus programas cómo.
es algo similar a America.
es el mismo señor que lo.
America que?
Americas Idol.
ah ah ídolo americano.
sí.
pero allá no le llaman ídolo americano.
ellos lo llaman.
sí claro en cada en cada lugar ponen un nombre distinto.
algo que que resuene más.
yo no sé cómo es que lo llaman allá.
pero es una cosa distinta.
y me parece raro que que ese majadero del hombre ese no ha podido decirle vamos a buscar una canción para ti.
para quién?
para que sea la canción de él.
así sea nueva.
o sea vieja.
pero que sea algo nuevo.
quién quién a quién al al cantante?
Potts.
él está cantando Nessun Dorma en todas partes donde va.
cantó para la reina de Inglaterra la semana pasada.
mmhm.
no la semana antepasada o en enero.
y entonces estaba en A B C la semana pasada.
y cantó la misma canción otra vez.
mmhm.
Nessun Dorma es la canción con la cual se clasifica.
que se que se se identifica a Paverotti.
ah Pavorotti.
no tenía que coger esa.
sí.
yo no estoy diciendo que sí tal vez él canta esa más que cualquiera otra.
mmhm.
pero una persona que canta tan bien así muy bien podrían prepararlo con una canción así ya sea
qué orquesta.
cómo es que se dice?
It's Been a Day?
esa eh que canta el quin el cuarteto ese de hombres.
ah sí sí sí.
cualquiera de esa canción no tenía que ser clásica nada.
no pero es que es que él.
por ejemplo Pavarotti se hizo famoso con esa canción pues será porque lo hacía tan bien.
y entonces muchas personas están tratando de imitar a Pavarotti a ver si y a ver si se identifica.
bueno ahora Pavarotti ya murió así que.
entonces la otra canción que tiene es Time to Say Goodbye.
esa ya tiene su dueño.
él no no puede estar cantando esa tantas veces.
sí pero bueno ese ese.
yo voy a tener que escribirle una noticia a Paul.
entonces tiene creo que Ave María.
eso es tu opinión.
no todo el mundo está diciendo eso que que que no tiene una canción de sí mismo.
una canción que lo identifica a él.
sí.
mmhm.
y va a tener que ir a un dentista también porque tiene esos dientes encaramados uno encima de los otros.
o un.
tal vez a un cirujano plástico y que le abra más los labios para que le quepan los dientes.
ajá.
ya yo lo estoy arreglando.
me da me me causa risa porque de seguro que muchas otras personas ha podido notar eso.
si si y con el dine con el dinero que ganan pues
sí.
y y y y y y porque no lo pueden hacer entonces?
está bien vestido ahora.
mmhm mmhm.
eso sí.
sí porque tiene dinero.
y el el pelo está bien cortado.
pero hay que cambiar el las canciones.
porque.
ya lo ya lo
yo yo yo le voy a mandar una lista de los que yo quiero.
él deber tener una una cosa en el.
cómo es que se llama?
en el internet uno puede mandarle mensajes.
ajá una una
sí una una una cómo se llama eso?
una
eh blog?
sí no un blog bueno blog es para que ellos escriben.
el blog es para ellos escribir cosas en términos más.
por eso.
es decir de cualquier cosas que quieran escribir.
pero ellos tienen que tener un lugar donde ellos reciben mensajes críticas.
sí ahí uno puede escribirlas ahí.
pero eso sería un blog tuyo hacia ellos.
sí pero ellos lo leen ellos lo leen ahí de todas maneras.
ellos leen lo que él escribe.
y lo que la gente corresponde.
lo lo que la gente le contesta?
bueno sí.
yo no sé mucho de eso.
así que yo yo le voy a decir.
tiene que arreglarse lo dientes.
tiene que echarse un poquito de sol.
bueno.
y tiene que encontrar esa canción que solamente sea para él.
y yo creo que esa.
tú tienes manera de hacerlo?
entonces.
sí yo creo que lo.
mientras no se haga sucio no no tengo restricciones.
sí.
ah esa canción que que cantan It's Been a It's Been a Day it's the end of the the.
sí.
esa es la que yo creo que él debería cantar.
bueno recomiéndalo.
hay hay una una que dice it's five o'clock somewhere.
quizás te quizás te te.
son las cinco de la tarde en en algún eh.
en alguna parte tiene que ser las cinco de la tarde.
yo no yo no yo no creo eso porque.
sí sí puede sí.
a a a toda hora no puede haber un lugar donde es las cinco de la tarde.
sí.
mira el el el el el imperio inglés se vanagloriaba de que el sol no se ponía no se ponía en en en en todo su imperio.
sí eso sí es cierto.
ajá.
el el el sol nunca estaba puesto en todo su imperio.
porque ellos tenían.
exacto.
porque ellos tenían ellos tenían eh dominios en tantos lugares a través de todo el el hemisferio.
sí.
tú sabes esos relojes relajo que tienen la hora.
qué hora es en Francia?
qué hora es en Egipto?
que?
sí.
ok.
hay.
tú pones cada uno en las cinco la hora no son muchos los lugares.
eh tú tendrás unos para Israel tiene unas horas distintas creo.
ah Londres tiene una hora distinta.
sí hay hay.
París tiene otra hora.
Inglaterra tiene otra hora.
Japón tiene otra hora.
Alaska tiene otra hora.
pero no creo que hay veinticuatro lugares que tenga.
sí bueno sí porque porque porque hay porque hay hay espacio digamos el el océano.
es que es una canción.
ahí donde hay lugares donde no no no va a haber digamos zona.
es decir no hay un un lugar específico con una zona de de.
es decir un un lugar que esté que esté en una zona de de de de hora de.
es decir opuesta a Greenwich.
así que yo no creo que es.
es una canción de de este señor que anda cantando música regular.
y dice que en alguna parte tiene que ser las cinco de la tarde.
pero es lo que quiere decir.
que en alguna parte en cualquiera parte tiene que ser hora de de tomar.
de de tomar.
eso es lo que quiere decir.
sí sí.
no es el reloj que que dice que es las cinco de la tarde.
sí sí tiene otro significado completamen.
este es lo lo que quiero que el sello tenga.
ustedes lo pueden hacer en una manera bonita o.
no.
tú tienes que buscarte un artista que te haga eso.
ay yo no puedo encontrar un artista así no más.
entonces cada uno y entonces para sellar ponerle el sello a cosas distintas.
sí bueno pero también hay letras que ya están hechas más o menos en esta forma.
hay hay catálogos.
y usted las tienen?
sí.
hay catálogos que.
hay ir a buscar sí yo te yo te traigo un
pero la tinta entonces de qué color se.
uno.
sí no una cualquiera tinta?
por qué?
porque tal vez un día lo quiero brillante y otro día lo quiero rosado.
bueno la forma de hacer eso es hacerlo de de caucho.
y tener almohadillas de diferentes colores.
será que en esto sí puede decir que tengo ganas de ir para el baño?
no no.
por qué no?
porque.
es una cosa natural.
no.
me vas a decir que que que que.
tú tú puedes aguantar hasta que ya no falta si no como unos diez minutos.
oh.
entonces van a tener que esperarse de que yo puedo hacer eso.
mmhm.
eh el Sam trató de conseguir al señor que le arreglara la computadora porque él dice que está muy muy lenta.
el bendito hombre le dijo.
y temí que que iba a hacer eso.
y no creo que es por la distancia.
que qué?
le dijo que era muy lejos.
que no valía la pena.
lo que yo creo es que tal vez no quería
Sam no le gusta la gente de Iran.
de de Iran?
yeah.
ninguno de esos ninguno de esos de esos países
mira a Sam a Sam a Sam no le gusta la gente latina tampoco.
no no dice eso a la gente latina.

no es cierto que no los quiere.
pero.
pero él dice que que que son irresponsables que son mentirosos que son esto lo de más.
que no cumplen con lo que dicen.
ah eso sí.
y y le le han causado tantos problemas.
eso sí es cierto.
él yo no más he escuchado una solo dos canciones de este señor.

no dicen dicen que él está
Bach Bach.

con todo.
Bach él trabaja para.
y bueno los padres él tenía padres y hermanos que eran músicos también.
bueno él enseñaba en la escuela de Lepsis.
pero por la noche se iba para su casa.
sí pero estaba trabajando en aquel entonces estaba trabajando para un príncipe.
pero después de ahí cuando terminó de ahí fue a trabajar en en en en otra iglesia.
y era haciendo las composiciones.
imagínate que tenía que tener una composición distinta cada para cada para cada fin de semana.
mmhm.
Handel también.
digo Haydn también.
sí Haydn también.
eso eso debe ser cansón no?
pero tenían tanta práctica.
pero ellos muchas veces se robaban de aquí y de allí.
bueno.
bueno sí todos todos ellos copia.
es decir no no no que robaban pero copiaban digamos.
copiaban algo que ya tenían.
y lo combinaban con con algo nuevo.
y y Bach tomó varias varias composiciones de de Vivaldi.
y él también las las las arreglaba a la manera de él.
ah ya.
cómo se llama?
en en Brasil hay un hombre que que escribió Bachianas brasileñas.
sí.
y es es a base de de.
ese es es guitarrista.
cómo se llamaba él?
no sé va.

y y pero también él tenía
él dice que él él las composiciones de él tenían el espíritu de los brasileros.
ah.
él él componía con el espíritu de la calle de los de los brasileros.
qué maluco que están esta gente.
tú tú has escuchado las tú has escuchado las composiciones de violín y guitarra de de?
y eran supuestamente aristocráticos.
no guitarra.
violín y guitarra de de de de cómo es el violinista que acabamos de decir que era el?

y también de de Joe.
cómo es que se llama?
cómo es el gobernador de de Nueva York cuando el nueve once?
Giuliani.
Giuliani hay un compositor Giuliani también que escribió muchas composiciones de guitarra y violín.
bonitas bonitas canciones bonitas piezas.
yo no sé.
yo creo que Juan Pablo debe concentrarse primero en piano.
aunque piano uno puede aprenderlo cuando esté mayor también.
pero puesto que ahora todo el que tiene piano va a tener que aprender piano primero.
sí.
pero.
pero el violín es para muchos es más fácil.
lo que tienen que aprender es.
no no no no violín no es fácil.
lo siento mucho.
Grace ellos cómo es cómo es el programa?
mmhm.
lo que lo que pasa es que que el violín.
el programa ese de de japonés.
cómo es que se llama eso?
Suzuki?
Suzuki pero no es porque el violín es más fácil.
no es más fácil.
y es que es que tienen que aprender a leer la.
uno de los los violinistas dice.
tú puedes aprender violín piano cualquiera hora de tu vida.
pero violín no.
no pero lo aprenden de pequeño.
y y y no.
bueno si aprenden de pequeño bien con alguien que valga la pena.
pero yo creo que ese maestro que que Stephen tenía no
él él tocaba tal vez cuatro rancheras y un y un vals.
y eso no no.
pero lo prime lo primero que tiene que aprender es aprender a leer a leer la música.
y y se ha probado que la gente que lee que que aprende a tocar un un instrumento.
a leer música aprenden a leer.
es decir se le desarrolla el el cerebro más rápido para otras cosas para otras disciplinas en la vida o o en la universidad o en el colegio.
bueno la cosa es que en el lugar donde él vive se coge un milagro para sacar algo bueno de ahí.
sí pero el que tiene talento el que tiene talento no.
un un un milagro y entonces después algo más.
el que tiene talento sale.
y dicen que el que el que el que como tenía Ortil Carrera tenía un dicho.
el que el que va a salir.
él se murió no?
no.
por qué?
quién te ha dicho que él se ha muerto?
él llegó a ser doctor.
él se murió.
no.
sí porque Esmeralda fue al entierro.

oiga eso es noticia para mí.
sí estaba hinchado y los riñones y otra cosa.
y quién te dijo eso?
y él estaba casado con otra persona y.
Hillary.
y entonces me dijo pero este estaba ahí con los hijos.
so where do you work?
I work well I'm currently employed by.
I have my broker.
he's a real estate broker.
my attorney he's a real estate attorney.
mmhm.
I work for a title company.
I work because um.
my attorney consolidated with the broker.
he owns both businesses.
but like his business partner he's the broker.
and his business has been so bad they consolidated.
so now I work.
oh I see.
for both of them together simultaneously.
they just pay me you know four hours one pays me the other one pays me four hours a day like that.
mmhm oh ok.
but I
and what do you do like receptionist or
I'm like the office bitch.
people can say.
pardon my French.
no it's all right.
but um I do everything.
I answer phones.
I get the mail.
I order supplies.
I babysit the realtors because half of them don't know what they're doing.
they don't know any of the forms.
they don't know anything.
mmhm.
so I'm a administrative assistant.
I'm a receptionist.
ok.
ok.
I'm a post closer.
wow.
I am the head of the post closing department.
I deal with everything that has to do
once a deal closes like when you buy a house.
mmhm.
you would go to a title company to do your closing.
right.
to sign all the paperwork.
after that I do the package.
I send it to the bank.
I deal with you know funding conditions.
then I'm the one who prepares the policy.
I do recordings.
you know I send the stuff to be recorded to the court.
you do a lot.
yes.
I do a lot and.
and where is that at?
it's in Doral.
oh ok.
but um.
you live here in Miami right?
yeah.
where?
do you know where the Mall of the Americas is?
yeah.
and the Walmart?
well not specifically the Walmart but I know where the Mall of the Americas is.
it's by there.
right by the Palmetto?
yes.
ok.
you know where Chevys is?
no?
no.
I've only lived here for like a year well a year as of December.
right where are you from?
New Jersey.
right.
ok.
and do you live.
I live in Miami yeah.
but where?
um.
you have to tell me a place because
yeah.
um.
you know how women are in directions.
you have to give them a landmark.
yeah.
how about
well it's off of Bird road.
I'm sure you know where Bird road is right?
yes.
right.
can we use Bird Bowl?
Bird what Mall.
Bird Bowl.
Bird Bowl um yeah yeah.
you've been to Bird Bowl.
no I have seen it but.
uh.
never been there.
um Bird Bowl farther west.
er.
way farther west like Bird Bowl is around like ninetieth avenue.
ninety second.
yeah I I'm around one fifty second.
yeah.
see that's what I'm saying way west.
ok.
I don't.
Lakes of the Meadow you never heard of it?
yes.
that's where I live Lakes of the Meadow.
I've inputted.
oh wait I haven't told you.
yeah.
job description.
what I told you is pretty much you know the receptionist the administrative assistant stuff is mostly for ok both companies do that.
post closers for the title company.
I also process files like when they come in a new file you know request title.
right.
ok then for the the broker um the realtors don't have to input their own listings I input em for them.
mmhm.
oh I see.
so if a house is going up for sale you know they bring me the listing I input it into this M L S it's the system or whatever.
yeah yeah I know what you're doing now.
and um.
most of them don't know what they're doing.
they don't know the forms.
it's it's really bad.
because I.
If you see I have so much to do that when they come to me and they tell me you know how to do their job it annoys me.
because I don't have time to babysit them.
what happened?
your Cuban comes out.
yeah.
and then um like if I have if I have to go to the bank to do deposits.
yeah actually um like last week I had interviewed um back in November I had interviewed with an insurance company and this lady she emailed me she emailed me out of nowhere last week and told me oh you know are you happy where you are because you know the girl that we hired back in November she has been promoted
mmhm.
are you you know interested in and I was like.
I wrote back to her I was like well I'm not really happy where I am and um um she goes
oh no and she writes back to me and she is like oh we're interested you know eleven dollars an hour.
I'm like oh really you know.
mmhm.
and then um maybe you make more than I do but whatever.
is that that's yeah that that's not it doesn't matter.
no.
I told my attorneys and the broker.
I sat them down and I'm like look this is what's going on.
and they are like oh you know thank you for letting me know.
mmhm.
but um then they told me oh no you know we'll raise you starting next week you'll start at ten and then in two months we'll start you at eleven.
yeah.
so it's good because I don't wanna leave where I am.
I mean I've been there for two years.
that's not bad.
I know my job like the back of my hand.
and then if I leave to the insurance company I'd be learning everything from scratch.
you'd have to start over yeah I know and you should stay.
I don't know the people so I don't know if their.
no you should stay.
the lady seems a little anal.
yeah.
so.
what's your major by the way?
my major.
mmhm.
undecided.
why are you undecided?
declared undecided but
ok.
I want to become an optometrist.
oh really?
yeah.
maybe even an ophthalmologist if I go the nerve to go to med school.
you can help me out because I have bad eyes.
I have contacts.
me too.
really?
what's your prescription?
I think damn you know I don't.

oh my God really?
point seventy five.
and then negative five point.

so if you think you're blind you should have my eyes for a few days.
so when you take your contacts out you can't see.
I can't see crap.
really?
yeah I can't see anything.
I thought I was the only one on that boat.
no because when I.
I.
well you know what I hate the most is um.
and I should get glasses.
I had glasses.
I I loose I I loose things so.
but um like when I when I'm watching T V and it's getting late I just wanna fall asleep watching T V.
so you don't wear.
but yeah I have to take them out you know.
yeah.
so that that's what sucks you know.
yeah.
and I'm looking at.
well what sucks for me.
squinting you know.
is that no when I get home I take off my not really before I go to bed I take off my contacts and obviously I have my glasses.
but I put them on and then if I take them off and I put them down somewhere forget it I lost them.
mmhm.
I can't see them.
so I have to like feel around for them so.
oh ok.
so you can't see up close either.
no I can't see far.
ok.
I mean you'd have to be like right here for me to see you.
really?
I have twenty twenty from like close like if I didn't have them on I can read fine you know.
oh no I can't.
like I if you know I can read that.
oh no.
but you know if like if you were to say what does that say I would
I like if I was
no if I had to read this like I had to be like like this close
oh really?
to be able to see it yeah it's really bad.
oh ok.
oh right.
and I'm scared to do Lasik.
yeah I was thinking about that.
what.
they well they recommend you to wait till you're twenty five.
oh really?
because it's when your vision kinda just balances out.
oh.
because at first they told me it was twenty one.
I didn't know that.
but I'm twenty one and my vision keeps you know increasing and getting worse.
yeah it it keeps getting worse yeah.
and um I'd say decreasing and then um my doctor he's like oh wait till you're twenty five.
and I'm scared because like if they do it and it doesn't come out right you can't go back to contacts.
yeah.
you have to do glasses.
so.
why can't you go to contacts because.
I don't know.
I guess it's something with.
it's yeah something they do that.
cause they cut you know they they like cut the the ret the like retina off.
if they laser it.
yeah but there's two different kinds of Lasik.
is there?
yeah there's Lasik and then there is another procedure.
I saw it on this show it's called Ten Years Younger.
mmhm mmhm.
on T L C I think it's.
yeah yeah.
and um.
do you like T L C?
the yes.
that's good I like T L C too.
and The Discovery Channel and all that.
yeah.
The History Channel more.
I'm a I'm a T V buff.
yeah?
I have a lot of favorite shows.
yeah like what?
like ok definitely Law and Order S V U.
which show?
I like all the Law and Orders.
C S A C S I.
C S I.
I love New York and Vegas.
I.
when I got here.
I don't like Miami.
no?
when I got here that's what I started watching C S I Miami.
C S I Miami?
and I was like wow this is a good show but after.
have you ever seen Vegas?
yeah I've seen Vegas.
I don't know everybody tends to like that one better.
because it's the original one.
yeah.
mmhm.
but after like six months I was like I can't take it.
it's too far fetched.
it's too you know.
oh but I love it.
first of all a precinct doesn't look like that.
the employees don't look like that.
obviously.
well come on.
it's cable.
I know.
well not even cable because at all.
it's T V.
it's T V.
I know but I like Law and Order because it's a lot it's it's it's real you know.
yeah.
I love it like.
it seems real.
I love Without a Trace.
a actually I haven't seen that.
Cold Case.
Cold Case is good.
Have you seen that?
I love it.
I love House.
House is really good.
I love House.
yeah.
what's another one?
what er um
I like the on A and E it's called The Justice Files or whatever Cold Case Files but real ones.
mmhm.
you know that I love.
you know what.
I love that.
the the problem with that is that when I watch like C S I and Law and Order I know it's not real.
so once you put me like.
in a real situation.
if watching the real things it affects me.
yeah.
oh I see.
yeah.
so I don't I don't know why.
wow no um there's there's nothin wrong with that wow that's.
so I don't.
because when I was senior year.
mmhm.
junior and senior year I got into psychology.
and I specially the abnormal psych.
yeah.
and I started reading a lot on um like psychopaths and.
right right right.
you know stuff.
I was also.
I took psychology too.
and I was really interested in that stuff too.
did you take A P?
no I didn't get into that.
I took A P psych.
because I
it was crazy.
yeah.
the national was crazy.
I got a four which is good.
How'd you really?
I thought I was gonna fail it but I got a four.
wow.
it's good so why don't you do that?
I can't I'll go crazy.
you watch C S I.
I'll go crazy along with them.
no.
I can't do it it's too much.
really?
I'm not that strong psychologically.
you are too much of a moral person?
it impacts you?
no.
yeah it does.
you take it personally?
I do I I can't.
even with T V sometimes like if I'm watching S V U or anything right before I go to bed.
oh yeah well that's the point that's what makes it a good show you know if.
yeah.
if you kind of take it personal.
but imagine just having their jobs.
you know.
oh yeah yeah.
I I couldn't be able to do it.
I couldn't be able to handle it.
no of course.
I'll break down like I I'm gonna need like a psychiatrist.
like you know all all the like the psychologists go into the psychiatrists.
you'll need therapy after yeah.
you'll need therapy after the case?
no I wouldn't yes.
I wouldn't be able to
I think people
I don't know either you have experienced something and that's why you're fighting against it.
right.
or you're just born you know with that strength to deal with all that you know because it's hard.
yeah.
I wouldn't be able to do it.
yeah well um it's like an outlook it's your perspective you know what I'm saying I I take things personally.
but.
mmhm.
you gotta you know on the other you gotta say like well sometimes you know I think you have to understand both sides first before you take it personally.
I think.
would you take it personally?
but the thing is is is not even takin it personally is you know don't bring your work home.
it's just no I know.
right.
mmhm.
but I wouldn't be able to do that.
I don't think anybody that does that can go by that.
right.
I don't think anybody's able.
we're all we're humans.
you know what I'm saying?
exactly.
no I don't think anybody can just say no.
mmhm.
I shut it off at night.
you know it's not something that.
you can't it's easier said than done.
exactly.
obviously.
and we can't do it.
it's like you're trying to sleep and your brain doesn't wanna shut up.
yeah.
exactly.
that brain chatter is what it's called.
mmhm.
what other shows do you like?
I love Heroes.
I I haven't seen that one.
a aside from that kind of show.
I haven't seen that one.
I love Heroes.
I've heard of it.

Chuck.
Chuck?
I'm an N B C fan.

I I'm not sure why.
I just.
Will and Grace?
well.
Will and Grace is alright i if you are ok with homosexuality.

no I'm fine.
oh ok.
I don't care you know what I'm saying.
I'm very pro gay.
I'm just saying.
so.
yeah no no no no I I don't care whatever.
ok.
you know I have gay friends and all that but what I'm saying is you gotta you gotta be like you gotta be ok with that.
you know what I'm saying you gotta see the fun in it because if it.
you don't see it?
no yeah yeah I do.
oh ok.
I'm just saying like other people I don't see that much.
like I I see how it's funny.
but I'm like it it ain't that funny you know what I'm saying.
but like for me comedy like re really good comedy is obviously um Comedy Central.
I like The Colbert Report.
I don't watch Comedy Central.
I never used to watch it but I when I saw The Colbert Report and the um and um damn um Jon Stewart.
John Stewart is funny.
oh my god.
well actually I'm just saying it.
The Daily Show?
Jon Stewart at the Oscars.
yeah.
he was hilarious.
give it a try.
what it is all all that show is like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report is is like.
like talk shows.
watching the no no no it's not a talk show.
it's not a talk show?
it's like watching the news.
what they do is they take news from the day.
ok.
like from C N N and something like that like the elections whatever.
and the they make fun of it.
ok.
everything's funny.
ok.
you know what I'm saying.
the they show pictures and they'll say this.
it's like The Soup Have you ever seen The Soup?
The Soup?
On E?
with Joel.
oh yeah yeah yeah.
somewhat somewhat yeah.
just not as
but this is like exaggerating.
I mean they exaggerate stuff they say whatever they want.
now you should you should watch it.
well obviously it's cable.
yeah give.
because it's Comedy Central.
right but give it a try.
you'll like it.
but what sh what comedy show do you like that is not on?
that's not on Comedy Central?
yeah.
um.
like just a regular.
that's like oh I used to love Everybody loves Raymond.
you know I like him but I can't
it has to be certain days that I could just sit through a whole show of Everybody loves Raymond.
really.
yeah.
oh that's that's cool.
it's a certain.
like in a show?
yeah it's a certain kind of comedy.
it's like an acquired taste.
me like I don't I like comedy like that that it's innocent and it's just everyday.
yeah right.
but like raunchy comedy like people that use like I don't know sex or insults and stuff like that I don't think that's funny.
ok.
no.
no because I.
well yeah no it's and it's not it's just not right.
it's what you see.
have you ever been to the Renaissance festival?
no.
ok well this is the Renaissance.
is that here?
yeah.
really?
it's in um where is it?
it's further I don't even know because I don't know directions.
but um Quiet Waters Park.
i is it Penbroke Pine?
oh ok ok.
I don't know it's one of those that you have to drive a little yeah.
one of those little cities near.
so it's a Renaissance festival.
ok.
and then they have this show.
the guy's called Christoph the insultor.
and basically you pay him to insult you.
mmhm.
really?
it's ridiculous the guy walks out with like five hundred dollars worth of people you know.
yeah yeah.
like people would pay for or it's a group that they pick one person.
yeah.
they put money together and then depending on you know how much they give him he'll how long he'll insult the person for.
right right right.
but it's so stupid like I didn't find comedy in it.
no?
I like like Friends.
have you ever seen that?
Friends is good yeah of course yeah.
you know Friends is funny.
yeah.
and what else is funny?
mmhm.
I like the.
Dane Cook.
no Dane Cook is really funny but he is vulgar come on.
well but.
he is vulgar oh are you saying you don't like vulgarity.
well I haven't really seen his stand ups.
I've seen his movies like.
yeah.
you know um Good Luck Chuck.
well that that was pretty raunchy ok but.
that's pretty the specially the unrated.
that's what I saw.
ok but.
I was like what?
I think that.
that's like a porno.
it is yeah it's bad.
but did you see um.
I have it I bought it too what a damn ass.
you know the part that I busted out laughing?
the part when she goes like this?
and then he's like what happened to you did you get in a fight with a stamp?
oh oh yeah yeah yeah.
you know that part is
I think that part was so funny.
oh yeah she was.
yeah.
it was all unexpected to me and I cracked up I was.
really?
I hadn't laughed like that in a while.
I just saw it the other day.
but I like comedy like that.
there you go.
I like the Family Guy.
Family Guy?
a lot.
you know I don't.
a lot like a lot.
I if I watch it alone.
yeah.
I don't find the humor in it.
no?
I don't.
wow.
maybe it's just
but if I'm with other people I see I don't know.
the thing about it.
, it's it's really subtle it's it's well it's not even subtle I mean it's like in your face.
right.
you know what I'm saying?
I guess maybe it's so in my face that.
it's yeah it's not even that
I don't get it.
it's like what Peter says it's either racial.
right.
a a a against gender or where you're from.
mmhm.
political I mean everything.
ignorant.
everything it's it's everything.
that's why I like it because it's like blatant.
right.
you know what I mean?
mmhm.
they don't care you know.
whatever it's stereotypes.
like me I watch it and I don't laugh.
like maybe I'll smile whatever but I won't laugh.
like I have a group of friends that are addicted to Family Guy.
yeah yeah.
and then when they talk about it and they say things that they say in the show.
yeah.
I laugh.
yeah.
because they make it funny and because I don't see the humor.
I see the humor in what they are doing.
specially Stewie the baby.
I love Stewie.
because he has like an accent because he's so smart.
yeah.
you know what I'm saying.
he is always trying to kill his mother I mean.
it's
or or another thing they do.
or this one time Peter you know the Pet Peter right the fat guy.
he.
yeah I know who they are.
, he he tripped right?
and he he like banged his knee.
mmhm.
and then he he he he he like sat on the floor and was holding his knee he was like.
and he did that for I think a minute.
it was just that for like a minute him doing that noise.
mmhm.
that's it like it's just it's.
stupid.
right.
but it's the noise it's like all right go on you know.
ok.
yeah that now but that family I think it's great.
actually you know what I used to do?
well.
mmhm.
I had a D V D player in my car like an In Dash when I lived in Hawaii and.
you lived in Hawaii?
yeah.
wow.
yeah.
for how long?
for a year.
was it beautiful?
oh yeah.
I'll tell you about that though but
every morning when I'd go to base when I'd go to Port Harbour I would play it like every morning.
is that illegal?
yeah you are not supposed to do that but.
that's how much I liked it.
you know what I'm saying.
and I would play it every.
that was my.
Family Guy.
like breakfast yeah Family Guy.
you know.
I guess I don't watch a lot of comedy because
it doesn't.
I don't know you can't gain knowledge from it.
I understand.
and you feel like you're wasting your time.
not really because I love comedy.
I love laughing.
yeah.
but.
if I'm gonna put time.
you want something informative.
yeah I wanna learn something.
and I.
something that's gonna stimulate your brain.
yeah.
no I know.
because in comedy you really don't have to figure out anything.
you know?
yeah yeah.
like in a murder.
well.
like.
well actually like with the Family Guy you gotta be quick.
because if you don't you know.
if you are not.
I'm not quick.
if you are not quick.
and you are not informed like on different cultures.
you won't get it.
right.
right.
I think that's my problem.
you you understand?
you know like like this one time they had a plane.
and it had a banner on it.
it said it said one thing.
and then the banner flew off.
and it said Colombian drugs.
you know what I mean?
it it's it's like that.
ok.
if you don't know then you are not gonna laugh.
ok.
like that you know.
they they make fun of everybody.
right.
everything.
like this one time Peter is um was like I need to be rich.
and he then he then he started singing a song like I need a Jew.
what?
do you know what I mean?
because Jewish people are rich so he's like I need a Jew you know.
mmhm.
that's what I'm talking about.
you see I wouldn't get it.
it's cultural that's what I'm saying.
because.
and it's like it's like what.
you know.
you know yeah.
yeah.
I wouldn't I wouldn't catch onto it.
yeah.
I guess that's why I don't find it funny.
yeah.
I have to have someone next to me explaining these things so.
yeah no but you know it's funny.
but Hawaii Hawaii is beautiful.
my uncle was there.
very beautiful.
during I think it was the second world war.
no I lied.
I don't know.
I know he was in the military.
and he was stationed in Hawaii.
oh ok yeah.
have you been anywhere besides Miami?
uh um I've only been on cruises.
oh ok so you've been to what the Bahamas
I've been to Cozumel.
yeah.
in Mexico.
yeah mmhm.
I've been to Grand Cayman Island.
and Ocho Ríos Jamaica.
how was that?
well the city itself.
how old were you?
fifteen.
ah ok.
the city itself is not pretty.
like it's nothing.
right.
to look at.
right.
I guess.
I mean the beaches are beautiful.
mmhm.
but um we climbed the the Dunn's River falls.
it's like I don't know how many feet.
it's the.
and then you climb to the first two hundred feet of the falls.
and you have they yeah they have guides.
right.
who will guide you.
what the?
and you need you know the water socks to go up.
because the rocks are slippery you know.
yeah.
on the water.
the water's freezing.
yeah.
it's the coldest water I've ever you know.
in Jamaica?
it's just the waterfalls.
oh the waterfalls oh yeah yeah that's fresh water yeah.
it's freezing it's freezing.
it doesn't matter how hot it is outside the water it would always be freezing.
mmhm.
and um there was this couple that they didn't go with the guides.
they decided to go up the middle.
retards!
and they fell.
they slipped.
and they fell down I don't know how many feet.
and they had they on a rock.
and they had broken ribs.
everything they were full of blood.
and it was crazy.
wow.
well at least you saw something right?
huh?
yeah at least.
at least you saw something.
but it was pretty.
and then that part was pretty.
but the city is.
no.
like and then guys offering you weed.
yeah and then you see like them wrapping the weed on the plants.
yeah.
I don't know I don't know.

no.
that's good.
I find it gross.

because we we we didn't stay there.
yeah.
where else have I been to?
well spring break I'm going to Virginia Beach.
oh yeah V A Beach.
huh?

I'm from I'm from up North so.

it's V A Beach yeah.
V A Beach.
and nobody calls it Virginia.
everybody says V A Beach.
ok V A Beach.
that's where I'm going.
spring break.
yeah.
because.
no that's cool.
you'll have fun.
my cousins live there.
don't don't expect the beaches to be like this though.
oh no no no no no I'm not going to the beach.
it's cold water.
it's gonna be cold over there.
no it's my cousin's fifteens.
and she lives up there.
don't get too wild.
no I won't.
are you a wild person?
no.
you are not a party person?
no.
I am actually going this Saturday for like the first time to a club.
really you are not a club person either?
no.
wow all right that's that's fine.
there's nothing wrong with that.
um I guess there is more to life than clubs.
so what do you do on the weekends then yeah no and there is.
well um well I was when I turned.
qué música le gusta?
música de todo.
I like everything.
yeah.
it just depends on the song.
ok.
if I like it doesn't matter the genre if it's country if it's pop rock anything.
as long as I Iike the song.
yeah yeah yeah.
like the thing was when I turned fifteen I met this guy.
we were together for four years.
mmhm.
wow.
and he was very machista.
yeah yeah yeah.
and he isolated me from everybody from my friends.
oh.
and I mean it was my fault in the way that I allowed him to do that.
but um
I got you.
it happened.
yeah.
and then we broke up.
well I broke up with him.
thank God that was over.
and the friends that you had when you were fifteen you know people change.
in four years specially those years from fifteen to nineteen you change a lot.
oh yeah definitely.
and I I tried you know to go back to those old friendships.
but it wasn't the same.
oh I see.
obviously you can't expect to find the same thing you left four years before.
no no no.
and obviously there's grudges from people you know.
you leave.
and.
oh now that I now that I remember antes de que se me olvide.
this lady from the school.
mmhm.
she told me she told me that she bought the subway passes for the whole year.
subway passes to where to New York?
to New York it's forty bucks.
yeah but you know what she bought I told you she bought that pass.
which one?
it's a special pass that they give.
um.
it's a special pass.
it's called something and it gives you also discounts to certain museums in New York.
it's like a
but for the whole year?
yeah con ese pase you know you can use it and you have certain discounts.
but it comes out more expensive doesn't it.
I don't know she says she can use it up and down as many times as she wants.
like I would
was she gonna give it to you?
I wonder if it has a picture.
I should ask her.
I don't know.
I don't know because I saw that.
they talk about it.
it's called something.
it's like a a supersaver I don't know what.
and I was like why do they keep on referencing this?
I wonder what it is.
but she just told me as in subway only.
yes for the subway.
it's for the it's it's for that.
but there may be something different that she bought.
because this one serves as as a as a thing for the subway.
but it also gives you if you have that card sometimes you can get into certain museums and things like that.
pero bueno I checked out the prize and I was like if we are just gonna use.
she told me she paid forty two dollars or forty dollars or something like that.
It's like using the metro here and you buy the annual pass it comes out cheaper.
ay yo sabía.
ay Dios mío.
tú eres de madre.

pero there's a whole bunch of restaurants participating.
what I wanted to ask Adelina was.
is that the one that they was doing in Coral Gables that they closed it down?
I've never seen it before.
I think so.
I've seen it in a in a in a
maybe like I bumped into it going home since it's on my way.
and I noticed that the streets are closed.
I yes and and and John has gone to it.
but I wanted to ask Adelina because they have a list of.
it says it says that they are gonna be serving.
there's gonna be wine right obviously.
mmhm.
but it's gonna be.
por cincuenta pesos?
exactly from from this place Wild Oats or something right?
oh no.
espérate.
but then I'm saying fifty dollars!
and are you gonna get hors d'oeuvres?
but then I went into the restaurant section.
and it has all the restaurants participating.
so I'm like bueno is each restaurant gonna have like a booth that you can sample their food porque está Flemmings ahí.
no yeah Wild Oats is not a
ok or are they just gonna pass the stupid hors d'oeuvres and that's it por cincuenta pesos.
it's a healthy store.

I mean
I'm sure they probably have a sampling no?

I did mine already.
yeah I think New York is old.
old news.
I need to clean it.
but now I know how to play.
old news.
well usually before you go to the bed you have to take him to do pee pee.
yeah we did.
but he still
but I guess he still got nervous when he was in the car.
yeah.
and he likes to stick his head out the window.
sí?
sí.
pero tengan cuidado porque se puede salir.
no because we put it really high high enough for only his head.
un pedacito de cristal.
sometimes he might put his feet.
but he can't get out.
y nada más con un pedacito chiquitico de cristal.
no it's about um
his hands could touch the top.
and his it's as high it's high enough for him to put his hands
and do you hold him?
yeah I hold him.
but I think that they're they're high enough so that él no se
Paula be careful.
because si él ve un gato or something he might jump out of the car after the cat.
chill.
be careful.
yeah but I don't think.
because he sees people all the time in the cars.
sí people sí.
but he never has seen a cat.
mhmm.
tú te imaginas si ve un gato.
qué pasa?
he's seen one before.
well you never know.
you have to be careful.
I know.
well tell me.
qué pasó con el voleibol ese tuyo.
cómo fue?
oh.
que tú has entrado en el team de voleibol muchacha.
quién te quién te enseño a ti jugar a voleibol?
I don't know.
yo creo que es una pasión.
it's like it's a passion already for me.
I.
did you play volleyball at the other school you were in?
we did.
pero it was completely different.
it didn't work out.
they they changed the entire game.
pero for the first time.
did they have a team there?
in my old school?
in?
yeah they did.
and tú sabes it wasn't the same.
pero now I actually get to go into a team where I actually get to play the game.
and you know I was so nervous.
because I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to you know entrar el team like if I was gonna make it.
cause I was cause I was around so many like awesome players.
y ya fueron.
pero me dijo tu mamá con la niña que before was in the team she didn't make it?
she didn't make it.
how come?
I don't know.
I think it was because she wasn't doing so good.
I'm not sure because maybe that's what they thought.
pero I thought ella fue like very good.
ella fue buena jugando?
sí fue buena muy buena.
buena?
y por qué no la cogieron?
maybe it was because.
I don't know.
maybe it was because that she had her grades low?
because if you have an F or maybe more than one F you can't go into the team.
ah.
oh oh.
maybe.
but maybe that's not the reason.
maybe they just didn't like her.
or maybe they had better players.
and when do you have to practice?
we have to practice every day uh every week um school day.
Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday.
I mean Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday.
y a qué hora?
Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday at seven forty five.
and Wednesday.
seven forty five in the morning?
yes.
and who's gonna take you?
I will if nobody will take you.
ah no.
look I'm not gonna get up that early.
no probably mami and papi.
ah bueno sí porque papi va temprano para trabajo.
y te deja ahí.
cuando te deja hay gente en la escuela?
well there will be other girls that are on the team there waiting.
y la maestra?
she'll be coming in at the same time.
Paula y
there are teachers coming in at that time already.
oh they do?
yeah but they're not there outside.
they're inside preparing for school to start.
inside the building?
yeah.
and we're outside.
and how do you get
through the office?
or you go outside?
well we go through the bus loop.
and the parents drop us off there.
and um
what's the bus loop?
where they where the bus is for for the kids that go on the bus.
they drop the kids off.
where I leave you early every morning?
uh?
the same place I leave you?
no the and on the other side.
dónde los niños juegan por la tablita esa?
ah
la patineta esa que yo veo?
oh no no no the other side where all the buses are.
oh in the back.
yeah.
ah.
that way we're closer to the school.
and I don't have to walk that far.
y después de qué hora a qué hora vas a a hacer la práctica?
it's an hour.

yeah.
yo pensé que eran sobre un casco plástico duro.
you're crazy!
como los que la gente usa para patinar.
tú sabes lo que gente usa?
yeah but that's not the same.
because if you go on the floor you can really hurt yourself with those.
es más que hurt yourself.
probably you can hurt the wood.
yeah.
in that place.
that's why.
sí donde juegan béisbol básquetbol no?

so you don't even look at a computer.
like he does it.
but he just does as far as he gets you know what I mean?
yeah.
and like he'll have time to do like maybe.
like we have to turn in a project for.
like every couple three weeks you turn in a project.
and then we have to do like one two or three tutorials.
and when he does the tutorials like he'll get through like one in each class.
but he won't go over all the material.
the projects take like four hours to do so mmm
so he doesn't go over all the material.
and the only time that we like actually have in class time with the computer like the teacher like can help you
uhuh.
is on Thursdays.
and it's only.
no.
from twelve thirty to one forty five.
and he looks he looks he looks really like strict man.
yeah bro.
when I I still have my hard.
he still has my hard drive.
I still haven't gone to get it.
been there for like a year.
flash drive?
yeah.
yeah bro.
I've lost two already because I give them
I turn them in.
and like the next week I forget to get them back.
and then like the week after that he doesn't know where the hell they are.
for real?
yeah.
usually he knows usually he knows where it is.
but.
but he's like oh yeah.
but because I don't know.
he said there was something wrong with him.
um
watch that girl that walks like a robot.
oh that's the girl from the gym right?
yeah she lives in the Everglades.
but um
he doesn't.
he says he's got a heart problem or something now.
and so he doesn't check the work.
like he actually has a person that helps him in another class check all the work for him.
but when I asked him he's like.
yeah yeah I have here that you did it.
but I don't know like.
I don't know what to tell you about your flash drive.
so I brought through two other.
I figured another one.
because I did the same thing the last time we turned all our projects in.
so he's losing the hard the the flashdrive?
I don't know if it's him.
it might be the other lady there.
but um that's his fault man.
because we have a lady.
but whatever bro.
as long as he gets the the grades in in and stuff.
dale!
I don't care.
dale.
yeah that anatomy class something is pretty hard man.
um that's what I thought.
take the nights bro.
you have to take anatomy?
oh I thought you said the advanced class of that.
you have to take the advanced class of that.
yeah.
doesn't Dan know everything about that?
I'm sure he does.
I'm gonna ask him.
he had to have taken it right?
yeah he did take that class.
computer but mine was computer application for business.
and then I have advanced computer application.
what's your major again?
international business and marketing.
oh yeah.
double major.
damn.
yeah bro.
now I told you how I found a lot of everything about that car bro.
what?
that it's two grand over the cost of of that car to get it fixed.
oh yeah yeah a lot of.
for for like for like a two thousand one Honda Civic like with leather.
and like I mean it's got a lot of extras and stuff.
it's like seventy one hundred.
and it the the estimate came back at ninety two hundred bro.
how many miles did it have on it though?
like fifty.
fifty?
yeah.
fifty what thousand?
yeah.
and what year was it?
two thousand one.
damn man.
why such little mileage?
huh?
why such a little mileage?
cause she bro it was her car from like when she was in high school.
she bought that car when she was a sophomore.
and then like she went to college or whatever.
and and like didn't drive.
she she went to U S F.
so at that campus it's not like Miami like you know what I mean?
yeah.
you go over there you just hang out there fraternity houses sorority houses or whatever.
like go to city every once in a while.
and she didn't come home.
she came home like bro twice a semester.
so she never really drove.
and then when she graduated from college and got that job working in New Jersey
uhuh.
, my parents but she got like seventy eight grand a year like right outta college banking.
so my parents bought her a they bought her a new car.
and and she just kept that car you know what I mean?
where does she live now?
uh Princeton New Jersey.
she lives in Jersey?
yeah.
does she does she like it over there?
yeah bro she likes it a lot.
and I I think the only reason she likes it that much though is cause she started dating this kid like three or four years ago bro.
I don't even remember how long ago.
I think it was like three years ago.
but he's from Pittsburgh.
and he goes to school in Arizona.
and like right about the time that like she got the job she graduated in uh fall.
uhuh.
, in in spring of last year so O seven.
and then got the job like right after that.
and for fall of O of O seven her boyfriend came back to Pittsburgh to do internship with U S View.
and so they were right next to each other.
why what does he what does he what is he studying?
I think something something with business.
like marketing or um management business management something like that.
he's a smart kid bro.
so so what it's like a long distance relationship?
yeah it was.
and and now and now he's back in Arizona so.
but whatever man I've been working out for three years bro.
I heard Jersey is like just the sun doesn't come out a lot and they got a lot of pollution.
yes but that's how everything up north is like.
bro when I up to New York with Adam this summer um bro it just got uglier and uglier the higher.
like the farther farther north you go it just gets uglier.

th the nicest beach I probably ever saw was in was when I went to Cuba.
I think the nicest beach I've ever been to is in Roatan bro.
where's that?
the island off the coast of Honduras bro that place is beautiful man.
and it's like
yeah.
bro the water's like green like like that blue like light green cause the sand is white.
yeah yeah.
it's like white soft sand.
that's how all the beaches are in Cuba.
yeah.
so um the the water's like really really green bro.
it's clear.
it's awesome.
our house over there is sick bro.
it's like a hour drive from the city.
like there's like three islands that that make up Roatan.
and uh Roatan is one of the islands.
and I can't remember what the other two are called.
but we have a house in Roatan which is the biggest island.
and like on this side on like the left side of the island is all like hotels marinas.
like because it's huge on diving because like like here's Honduras.
and the islands are right here.
and like all of this like off the coast of Mexico and like um Guatemala and stuff.
all of that is is like the second largest uh coral reef formation in the world.
all of that.
what's it called?
I can't remember.
but it it like stretches all the way to Roatan like it ends over there.
some awesome fish in there huh.
oh my god yeah bro and like diving is.
that's where I went scuba diving for the first time.
my dad learned how to how to scuba dive from Jean Michel Cousteau.
oh yeah?
Jean Cousteau's son yeah.
he did his first night dive with him and everything.
they jumped out of a helicopter one time.
in a dive?
into the water at night yeah.
when you when you you jump like that.
and the the eli the helicopter is like twenty feet above the the water.
and you just jump
no way!
, with with full gear yeah.
full gear?
yeah.
from like from like twice twice as high as as this
and how do you get picked up?
the the um
a lift?
the helicopter comes down with a yeah.
what do you do?
they have like a G P S on them or something for helicopters to find them at night time.
they they you put a a buoy.
there's a buoy in certain spots.
and you have to come back to the buoy.
and he said you have you have uh under water like ten or fifteen feet under water.
there's a blinker that goes off on the buoy that you can see for like miles under water
for real?
so you just have to like
because bro have you ever been night diving?
no.
I've never been.
but my dad told me like it's the sickest craziest feeling ever.
because you can be be going down bro and you think you're going up.
you're going up yeah.
cause you don't you don't realize it.
so he says there's like a blinking ball just like a big light bulb.
and it just blinks and blinks and blinks like every two seconds.
so and you see it.
so um and it's like two it's like ten ten fifteen feet under water.
so you just go back to that whenever your your tank's almost out.
and the helicopter will come back.
damn.
yeah my grandmother bro the craziest story I've ever heard.
my dad told me that when he was out there building the house because my dad was in Notre Dame he it took him six years to graduate.
like the the the School of Architecture at Notre Dame takes like four and a half to five years.
like it's a four year program.
uhuh.
but um like if you don't like do summer and all that stuff like it usually takes people more than four years or whatever.
but it took my dad six years because he took a year off and moved to Roatan and built our house out there.
wow.
so he said that when he was out there um bro it was like three or four o'clock one afternoon.
like they just got done working.
he just like grabbed a beer and went down to like grabbed a case of beer and went down to the to the dock and our dock.
um remember I told you my uncle had that shrimping company?
yeah.
my grandfather whatever.
yeah.
wow that's like a mile down.
like we own all that land all that side of the island.
my grandparents owned like the entirety of it.
like they've they've sold a lot of it now.
but we own like all of it so the the thing's like a mile down.
and the water is really it's not like here the beach.
like it stays steady.
like it's a a steady drop.
because it's like in a bay.
like the island's right here.
and there's a little island like a little island right here that used to be an air strip.
and then the coral reef is back here.
so the water goes deep really quick.
so the the dock goes out like fifty feet cause bro my grandfather used to have a fifty two foot yacht out there.
and the water is like a hundred feet deep at the end of the dock.
it's like a fifty foot dock.
so he said they were in there building the the dock.
and they were done with like the first um like twenty feet of the dock.
and he said that he saw um a manta ray just like swimming bro.
he just saw it go under the the dock like farther out and then come back.
and then he just said that he heard like a big bang.
and then he saw the dock like a piece of the dock fall into the water.
and he said that there was like a twelve foot uh hammerhead shark that was chasing the manta ray.
no way.
and he he went underneath the the docks.
and he broke the pilings there bro.
it was probably like thirty feet deep forty feet deep where he hit it.
and the pilings are big bro.
and he just said that he broke right through them.
and then they just kept going.
oh my god.
yeah bro.
that's insane man.
bro we're planning a trip to Honduras next summer.
we're definitely going out there for like a week.
well uh the only time I went diving was in a lake man.
no way how was that?
it was crazy.
dark water uh?
yeah man it was pretty scary.
it was like it was like the beginning of um it was kind of like the end of the winter so the wa the water was still cold like it had been colder the the days before.
so like I didn't even wear a wetsuit man.
and we lake water is is colder
it's cold yeah.
because it's like still water.
mmhm.
so so we went diving.
and it was like forty feet deep in the lake or a little bit more so
bro there's nasty stuff in lakes bro.
because there's something that falls in there.
yeah yeah.
a hundred years later it's still there.
no there was there was like a a a big statue like a Jesus statue down there.
no way how weird!
yeah it was weird.
that's creepy bro.

and there was like grass all over the place.
I didn't I there was like a couple like bats swimming around.
it's it's a pretty big lake.
but I got it was so cold.
I wasn't wearing a wetsuit.
I got so cold that when I got out of the water my uh my uh like extremities like my fingers tips

and I was I was shaking like you know like your bottom jaw starts to shake crazy.
yeah.
and had to jump in a hot ass shower the next day.
no like right there I had to jump into a hot shower.
yeah yeah yeah.
and the next day I got the nastiest cold.
I was sick for like two weeks.
yeah bro because your body stays that cold for a while.
yeah yeah I was cold for a while man.
I thought I was gonna like get hypothermia or something.
yeah one time.
I'm sure I was like at the beginning stages of hypothermia.
yeah for sure.
but that's what most people don't like like a lot of people get that like hypothermia starts like early you know what I mean?
yeah.
you can be in the first stages of it and not realize it.
oh yeah for sure.
one time we went to Dela which is like the north coast beach in Honduras.
mmhm.
and we went to a um Punta Sal which is just like a little key that's off the coast or whatever.
and bro my eyes are really really sensitive.

like she came to school herebut she moved back as soon as she graduated.

everybody else in my dad's family like when they came to school here they stayed here for at least a couple years.
so they made her a house over there.
and it's like my cousin's house my grandmother's house's stables and then my house.
so I was always at my grandmother's house with my cousin.
like after school you just get dropped off there.
and like just chill there all day.
so we spent the night there.
and like ten in the morning bro we were messing out in the backyard.
and um I was like nine or ten and he was like twelve or thirteen.
and bro he starts pissing.
and like we were both pissing.
and then like in the back of my grandmother's house.
and um bro he's going and then he pees on me bro.
no.
so I like and it's like on a hill so like there is a street there was sticking out that way so like I jumped up on the tree like that.
and like I started going like that like I stumbled on my foot

the guy the doctor said they probably all of them wouldn't even come out till the next day.
no way.
he was like do you wanna pull each one out like do it.
but he was like we gave you something for the swelling so when the swelling will be gone by tomorrow and they'll just pop out on their own.
wow.
I woke up and I had the worst headache ever and then like I just bro.

ten?
that's where yeah that's where I could feel the pain the worst.
wow.
it was horrible.
yeah man.
what time?
soon you're like it.
oh I forgot to tell you the funniest thing happened.
remember?
yeah.
the one that we met.
he went diving one time with a hose like you know they have the the pump on the top.
yeah.
yeah.
and then you have another hose that you can use it like for lobstering.
yeah.
and he went to um he went on a he was using it one time and he got a bubble.
in the hose?
in a
or in his chest?
in in his chest.
no way.
it was like a like something in his lung or something in his lung hey when he ca he called the pharmacy asking my mum she's like she's like oh chief you know what I do” uh.
and bro when he when he was talking he sounded like he had a pinched nose he was talking like that like that was talking like that.
yeah yeah yeah.
and my boss said oh vete para el vete para el hospital estas loco  like
that was dangerous.
yeah you could die a he he went to the hospital and I think they said he had like a a a nitrogen mower or something built up in his in his lung something like that.
bro that can't be healthy.
he could've died if if one of those um bowls goes to your brain you're dead.
done for it.
bro she has to do with her lungs but she told me how she was going to the club one day with some of her friends.
and they were in Honduras.
and like they got in a car accident.
and she had just gotten out of the car.
and they went to like across the street to the gas station to to to get cigarettes or something.
and they came back like they got in a bad accident or something.
and and like the car had flipped or whatever.
and but everybody there was fine like the girl that was in the passenger seat like went to the hospital and she broke her arm or whatever.
and the dude that was driving was like no no I feel fine like "my mother".
and his mom was a doctor or whatever.
so he was like I'm just gonna go home and gonna have my mom look at it.
and he went home.
and um he died in his driveway bro in his car.
yeah.
his lungs
the seatbelt the seatbelt.
yeah his lung um his uh one of his ribs broke and punctured his lung.
his lung yeah.
and he choke on his blood like horrible way to die.
yeah that's how I remember it when man I told you man when you got that eye symptom to get checked out cause that shit can happen.
yeah definitely.
you can you cannot even notice that you you're like injured profusely inside.
yeah bro the next day I woke up and my back was killing me bro my back hurt so bad.
no not even that you could have internal bleeding somewhere and not even know it.
yeah.
bro that scared tha sc bro that was scaring me straight though like I aven't even thought about it for so long.
yeah man.
it was probably the worst thing that's happened to me in a year.
bro I can't one year eating on my street
yeah I figure.
yeah bro.
that he was going to be looking like at your surroundings when you're driving.
yeah.
and try not to pay attention to other things because you only have like that one little second
a split second man.
to react and if you don't yeah you're done.
you're done bro.
that's so crazy man.
that happened to my dad when he was fifteen he got hit by an eighteen wheeler he was crossing the street and the driver didn't see him and he nailed him he was in a coma for like a long time.
the doctor said that he wasn't gonna make it that he was gonna die.
damn.
like if you look like at his eyebrow.
how fast was in the eighteen wheeler?
I don't know but you know way
mile an hour.
yeah it was an eighteen wheeler man do you know how much weight that thing has behind it?
yeah.
yeah bro it's how hard it is.
and so yeah he was in a coma for a long time.
and the doctors said the my grandma would say oh you know what what can you do for him dies” like ah it's it's in God's hands now”.
yeah for real.
there's nothing we can do.
it's horrible huh.
because imagine when you get a brain trauma like that your brain swells you get swelling in your brain if you know what I mean.
yeah.
oh my god.
I was watching uh Family Guy.
and you you you've ever seen one when Richie learns how to ride a bike and then the bullies steals his bike or whatever?
I don't remember that one.
um what's his name is a oh my god I's name bro.
Robert.
yeah Robert and he he's he's filming Richie right on the bike.
and then bro like a bag around and he's like
he starts smiling like in American Beauty.
yeah yeah he says oh my god it's so beautiful.
or a beautiful life was it?
yeah I don't know.
I think it's a beautiful mind.
one yeah a beautiful mind.
bro and he for like you know how in Family Guy some stuff runs on forever for like forty five seconds is like filming the bag.
yeah.
and he's like oh it's so beautiful.
and then they like show a clip of god upstairs.
and he's like that's not beautiful you should take a look at your circulatory system.
oh god.
I wanna take an anatomy class.
anatomy's hard man.
it's a lot harder than everybody thinks it is.
yeah.
bueno y qué tú crees de de aquí la cuadra lo que están haciendo?
la rotondita esa do you like that?
pero that's illegal.
esa rotonda es illegal.
from what I know.
supuesto de eso es illegal.
y si y si entra algún camión ahí por ejemplo a dejar muebles o cualquier cosa.
yo no sé.
cómo va a doblar esa rotondita?
porque no está fácil para los carros de uno.
no.
no pero.
no tanto este lado sino el el lado izquierdo.
el de entrar o el de salir?
cuando tú entras.
mmhm.
bueno ese está en la intersección.
ese tiene bastante espacio.
lo malo el otro yo lo veo más difícil porque es más más estrechito.
pero viste las cositas que compraron para los speed bumps?
tú viste lo que van a hacer?
no.
tú no has visto una.
sí los los bloquecitos esos.
los bloquecitos esos para ponerlos en el medio.
sí.
donde estaban las tablitas esas.
en lo que hicieron de concreto.
ajá.
pero y pero eso lo que va a ser como un pedacito de de de tile ahí.
sí pero a lo mejor.
pero yo no creo que eso sea mucho speed bump.
bueno.
eso más bien yo creo que lo que va a hacer es como un adorno pero.
baja la velocidad ahí?
pero la calle no la van a hacer no?
sí la van a asfaltar.
pero es que yo no entiendo.
porque primero se asfalta antes de poner el el la hierba.
bueno.
no que yo sepa.
sí sí sí no tiene tienes razón.
el asfalto era.
están están gastando doble dinero ahí.
el asfalto era para que lo hubieran hecho primero.
hubieran limpiado todos los leftovers de asfalto y toda esa cosa.
entonces después haber sembrado la hierba.
haber recogido.
limpiado.
y ya acabado y eso.
pero bueno ellos tendrán su idea.
y el parquecito viste que van a hacer?
aquí atrás?
el parquecito.
no no me he fijado.
no viste que te mandaron una hoja hoy con todo lo de del meeting?
no no no e e estaba en la puerta.
cuando salimos que nos íbamos para el bicycle shop.
mmhm.
estaba puesto en la puerta y yo lo tiré para dentro de la casa y nos fuimos.
y ahora les ya vi que lo había sacado de de la maleta.
pero no me había fijado no me había no me he fijado qué cosa hay dentro.
y se ha está rico el tiempo.
it's beautiful.
mmhm mmhm mmhm.
está tan lindo.
sí.
esta terraza déjame decirte que vale el precio de la casa.
espacio.
y eso que no la has puesto en una cómo se llama esto una un hammock de esos.
una hamaca?
una hamaca.
no.
no te ha dado por eso?
ahí mira entre las dos palmas las puede poner ahí.
ahí se pudiera poner sí.
yo tengo una que cada vez que nos vamos camping we take it.
and I set it up in the in the campground.
pero no aquí no se nos ha ocurrido como aquí lo que pasa es que the the ground in the back it's slanted.
yeah.
it's not even.
so that's something to
pero sí se pudieran poner un par de tubos o algo so we could uh install the hammock.
this is great back here.
mmhm yeah.
and this month that is pretty cool.
it's really really nice.
when it gets to July and August it gets hot.
you gotta wait until almost the end of the day.
that starts cooling off a little bit to be out here.
at a at three thirty four o'clock it's fine.
ah but thank God you don't have to worry about a pool.
bueno we.
because pools are good for when you have smaller kids but already.
they don't even wanna jump in it.
eh we had a hard time finding the house.
because we were looking for a house in Miami Lakes on the lake without the pool.
and that made it very difficult in nineteen ninety eight when we bought here finding that.
we couldn't find it.
we couldn't find any house.
most of the houses have pool.
they all have pools.
and then we came across this one.
que la est estaban vendiendo desde abril.
el viejito se había muerto.
la estaban vendiendo desde abril.
ya yo me recuerdo.
habían bajado el precio un viaje.
y entonces como en agosto que nosotros encontramos la casa habían vuelto a bajar el precio.
y entonces negociamos con con la hija de Lucía la señora que vive aquí.
mmhm.
and we got it pero.
a house on the lake without a pool is almost impossible to find.
but you've done a lot to this house.
mmhm yeah.
you have done so much.
it's incredible.
yeah.
y ahora vamos a hacerle el baño.
yeah.
porque el baño está el baño original.
eh we are gonna redo the bathroom.
ah my idea originally was just to leave the tub.
y change everything else.
pero ahora the new idea is gonna be that we are gonna to replace everything.
change.
make it a shower.
you don't like showers?
no we are gonna put a t a tub but a new tub.
oh ok.
because it's gonna be very hard to leave an old tub.
and then match everything else to the old tub.
so kind of a
we are gonna re redo the whole thing.
quitar las paredes poner los dry walls esos nuevos.
que no deja que que no asome la humedad.
humidity.
que ah eh eh son como waterproof.
mmhm.
y entonces también.
eh llevan las losas los ladrillos los
para arriba.
hasta arriba hasta el techo.
y aquí antes was half way.
sí ahora están eh más o menos al nivel de la ventana.
mmhm.
y hay lugares que alrededor de del inodoro que están bajitos bajitos.
entonces llevarlo hasta arriba.
después que hagamos uno posiblemente hagamos el otro.
y ya entonces ahora quiero eh los the sprinkler system arreglarlos y
empezar por retirarnos.
hoy fuimos a ver un camper un R V.
yeah.
sí.
sí porque este the one we have is nice.
but it's fairly small.
and when you get to the place you have to actually put it up.
up.
and and open it and put it together.
the other one no.
the other one everything is in place.
you just get there.
and press the button.
press the.
right.
and.
and everything opens up.
you don't even have mmhm.
my friend has an R V.
it's beautiful.
oh my god it looks like a house.
mmhm.
mmhm.
but it's big.
you know.
mmhm.
and he takes it with him.
I mean it's wow.
he presses the button.
mmhm.
that whole thing like opens up.
it's got a master bedroom.
yeah.
and a
mmhm.
and two other bedrooms with a bathroom pretty big.
mmhm.
I mean it's really nice.
mmhm.
the kitchen is beautiful.
yeah.
yeah.
flat screen tvs I mean he's got it
mmhm.
yeah.
because he likes to go to the Keys a lot.
yah the Keys are getting very.
expensive.
right difficult expensive and difficult with.
it's very hard to find a camping sp spot over there.
space now.
yeah because what they do is they build now on them instead of.
right they close them.
they close American Outdoors they close a a bunch of them.
yes because people are making money selling the property so.
mmhm.
yeah.
they don't make as much renting as they do selling.
yeah.
and the campgrounds were beautiful places to build on.
because they were huge pieces of property a lot of them right on the ocean on the water.
so you know it was a good deal.
yes.
so they closed them.
American Outdoors was a beautiful place.
and they just closed it down.
mmhm.
wow.
mmhm.
viste.
oh look at the little.
la coneja de Pepita.
es una conejita?
Cleopatra yeah.
yeah that's.
oh my god.
when Pepita moved to Tampa she acquired the rabbit.
y that was her companion.
is it a miniature?
no.
it's a Dutch
no.
I don't know something Dutch.
ay how pretty.
mmhm.
I have a friend of mine that has two miniature rabbits.
yeah.
he keep the he has them as pets.
and they are little.
mmhm.
they don't grow much.
yeah.
esta she got it.
and I have some another doctor over there that has a miniature pig.
yeah.
that's the daughter's pet.
it's a pig.
that that real real pig los los los with with a big belly?
mmhm but the little ones the miniature ones.
yeah.
yeah.
how cute.
everybody has their own pet.
mmhm.
how is everything at the hospital?
good.
sí?
it's busy but it's good.
mmhm.
you know they have more work less people.
yeah and less money.
every yeah because you have to work double so.
yeah.
yeah yeah we've been three years without a raise.
because.
I mean what we do is they give us like a raise I mean is it depends on how much you make.
but basically what it does is then every year they put up the insurances so high.
mmhm.
that the little money that you are making.
they take it away.
it's they take it away with the insurance so really you are not seeing much.
sí.
it's just like there's no raise.
así mismo nos pasa a nosotros.
you know.
and I'm the one that pays the insurance because my husband's insurance is much more expensive.
that's it yeah.
yeah because since I work for you know they have a lot more.
yeah.
so you know it's
mmhm.
insurance is cheaper but still.
sí.
ahora one advantage I have is that Pepita since she is working for the county she's gonna be independent.
I'm not gonna have to carry her in my insurance any more.
yeah.
because she'll have her own insurance and for her working for the county the insurance is free.
and for Pepa is free.
and I pay if it's just for me it's just like thirty dollars a month.
no that's not bad.
no that's not bad pero right now.
and isn't it better for you to go with her with the with the county no?
no because if we go into the family plan her plan is more expensive than mine.
oh I see.
that's why I had it.
I had the insurance under me for Pepita.
oh ok.
and me because Pepa had her own.
but now that Pepa has her own and Pepita is gonna get her own then I can get mine on my own.
it's thirty some dollars which is not a bad deal.
but my brother my brother was telling me that that that law that came about with the homestead exemption.
mmhm.
that he was saying that you know that it's not worth it.
he was telling me that so many people from the county are gonna lose jobs because of that.
they are gonna take you know they are gonna the cut down is gonna be so drastic.
and the people what they are gonna save for the homestead is so minimal that it wasn't worth it.
and I said well.
yeah.
pero.
everybody is looking for a buck.
pero you know I don't agree with him.
no?
in two thousand and three that the taxes were more or less what they are now.
mmhm.
right?
that was five years ago.
the salaries of of employees and the hiring of employees have not increased what they increased in revenues.
so where is all that extra money that they made when the when the boom was going on?
tú sabes?
it was misspent.
ah they bought things that maybe they didn't need to buy.
they made
tú sabes?
let's bring it back to where we donde estamos ahora.
tú sabes u una cosa básica lo lo lo necesario.
contéstalo contéstalo si quieres.
así hablas un poco.
hello.

and he is studying for his R N to see if he can get it now.
sí.
you are still at hospital right?
yeah.
mmhm.
I haven't moved from there because it's so convenient.
and you know I other offers.
hmm.
but don't wanna go in the street any more.
yeah.
you know because with sales you can do a lot you can make a lot more money.
yeah.
in the industry.
mmhm.
but it's just that you have to drive around so much.
you know cars everything is so expensive.
no no y.
right.
it's not worth it.
it's not worth it being on the streets.
I go there I do my eight hours.
and I get out and I go pick up my kid and that's it I'm home.
mmhm.
you know.
mmhm.
no vale la pena estar en la calle como está la calle hoy.
donde quieran te roban.
no.
te asaltan te matan por cualquier cosa.
er te asaltan exacto.
mira ahí el tú viste como mataron a la gente esa ahí en el Chili's.
la del Chili's sí.
sí.
pero mi la la gente que vive aquí en Miami Lakes they get very upset because of that because they say que Chili's was in Miami Lakes.
and Chili's is not in Miami Lakes.
la cincuenta y siete no es Miami Lakes entienden?
no is is is not is not tha that that's actually unincorporated Dade County.
that's Miramar.
that's
no no that's er Miami Gardens no?
no that's unincorporate no that's incorporated Dade County that's Dade County.
so what what is it called?
Dade County unincorporated Dade County.
so that's Dade.
it's like what we were before.
before we became a town.
yeah.
we were unincorporated Dade County.
the subdivision was Miami Lakes pero it was unincorporated Dade County.
then we became a town.
they are not a town they are not a city.
they are just unincorporated Dade County.
but do don't they call that area a certain area and they don't they have a name.
that's Carol City.
Carol City right?
Carol City pero.
ok.
Carol City is not a city or a town.
it's a subdivision.
ok like we were.
como Miami like we were.
ah ok.
right.
tú sabes.
pero cuando se refiere.
just like after that palmero.
that's not Miami Lakes.
Navarro.
er los Burger Kings and McDonalds todo eso para allá es.
no.
unincorporated Dade County.
is Miami Gardens.
no no no Miami Gardens doesn't come across fifty seventh avenue.
tampoco.
that's sixty seventh avenue.
if you are gonna call that anything eso es la zona de Palms Springs North.
ok.
eso es lo que le llaman que no es Palms Springs North because Palms Springs North empieza en la setenta y nueve que es el para allá.
así que esto es un pequeño pocket que hay ahí.
que.
que.
y entonces por eso le dicen Miami Lakes.
er le le dicen Miami Lakes because es el pueblo o la ciudad más cerca a donde está le dicen Miami Lakes.
tú sabes?
pero fíjate una cosa.
siendo nosotros Miami Lakes y siendo incorporados tú pones
three three zero one four y sigues saliendo en Hialeah.
sales a Hialeah sales a Hialeah.
yeah.
why don't we get our own zip code?
we are getting our own zip code tres tres cero cuatro.
tres tres cero uno cuatro.
no porque tres tres uno cuatro coge mitad de Hialeah entonces.
bueno pero supuestamente el cambio viene en que er tres tres cero uno cuatro va a ser Miami Lakes.
y cuándo?
no sé.
pero eso lo dijo
because I keep telling like if you call a credit card you call somebody and you give them an address and you tell them Miami Lakes they are like "no madam" and I "ok Hialeah.
er mmhm mmhm mmhm.
right.
because if not they don't know where to put you know they don't know where to send you the stuff.
sí.
sí pero fíjate eso no es una cosa que tiene que hacer el town of Miami Lakes.
eso es una cosa que la tiene que hacer el gobierno federal en la parte de del del post office del correo.
mmhm.
ellos son los que tienen que hacer esos cambios.
y supuestamente they are in the process de hacer ese cambio.
de cambiar del correo de que tres tres cero uno cuatro va a ser solamente Miami Lakes todo lo que es Miami Lakes lo que está dentro de de el town de Miami Lakes que incluye del lado de allá pa l metro Royal Oaks ahora es Miami Lakes.
ok.
right.
y eso ahora no es tres tres cero uno cuatro eso es tres tres uno cero cinco uno quince.
correcto.
es otro zip code.
entonces ese zip code lo van a cambiar también a que sea tres tres cero uno cuatro porque va a ser Miami lo que está dentro de la ciudad de Miami Lakes.
es eso.
eso fue lo que yo oí y lo que dijeron.
si lo hacen o no lo hacen.
pero va a ser tremendo rollo para la gente.
sí.
er pero bueno.
hoy me llegaron las las planillas para el W ten forty.
sabes es la ten forty.
la que tienen que hacer ahora los viejitos que están retirados.
ah sí.
para que sepan.
sí.
para que puedan entonces mandarles los trescientos dólares.
para que le den los quinientos pesos sí.
sí son las ten forty or ten ninety nine?
ten forty.
yo la tengo ahí en la casa.
mmhm.
ya a mi hermano se lo hizo mi padre.

porque yo sé que le hace.
pero yo sé que hay que ponerle algo arriba en la planilla.
de que es retirado o algo de eso.
tiene un nombre ahora se me olvidó pero tienes que ponerle eso arriba porque si no.
sí.
es igual que cuando uno manda los cheques al I R S.
mmhm.
hay que poner el ten ninety nine con el número de social security y toda esa cosa.
que si no no lo acept no no es que no lo acepten si no no te lo acreditan los los tienen que acreditar.

yeah.
it's delicious.
oh that's good.
y we were there and Pepita asked er we asked her what she wanted for dinner.
she said well bring me some ribs.
so we brought her some ribs so.
that's funny.
she said she said I'll I'll I'll have them for dinner.
so got here she ate them.
and I said I thought you were gonna wait for dinner.
me dice no no I'm hungry I'm gonna eat now.
so she ate so.
ya hoy Pepa no tenía que cocinar.
mmhm.
I I went this morning I Jennie breakfast and then we haven't eaten anything all day.
Jennie is the little one.
yeah Maria is working tonight.
mmhm yeah.
and she is off already for er
mmhm.
the schools are off for easter.

the universities.
yeah.
Pepita no estaba?
todavía ahora acaban estos días.
ella ahora empezó Jennie Jennie allá.
ya empezó el spring break.
yeah.
sí yo no sé qué día empieza Pepita pero F I U está er.
look yo I found that that that Saint Thomas started too early.
they tried to stag.
tú sabes.
so not all the kids are out at the same time.
at the same time yeah because it would be atrocious for Miami
mmhm yeah.
beach.
yeah.
and we get a lot of kids from the outside.
yeah.
that come from northern states er.
you know traffic is gonna get bad all these days now.
yeah.
although before it used to be Fort Lauderdale Miami where all the kids came down to.
now they are spread all over the place.
yeah.
they go to Jacksonville they go to Panama City.
tú sabes different places.
mmhm.
the Keys a lot of them like to go down there too.
the Keys the Keys.
lo que pasa que the Keys er.
very expensive for them.
for er er er college kids es imposible.
pero let me tell you Miami Beach is getting to be the same way.
yeah.
before the kids used to come to Miami Beach and hang out but.
yeah.
ya pero.
first of all they are not renting it to the kids any more you got to have an adult that would rent the place.
right.
and we are talking about almost two hundred dollars a night minimum to find anywhere which before for fifty something dollars you can rent out at the beach spend the weekend.
er yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
pero everything else it's cheaper at the beach than in the Keys.
yeah.
like restaurants transportation you know.
oh yeah.
ah in in Miami Beach er they go to Burger King they go to McDonalds in the Keys you don't find that mu that too often.
oh yeah.
so if they have to go to regular restaurants es caro.
tú sabes algunos de los restaurancitos esos um er in the Keys er no son nada del otro mundo pero te cobran te cobran más que un Burger King o un MacDonalds so for kids is not bien bien práctico.
yeah.
mmhm.
estoy mirando el reloj.
yo creo que hemos hablado bastante.
está bueno el aparatico ese que tiene la grabadorecita esa.
grabando a la gente cuando te hacen algo.
sí.
hey here you go.
er los otros días sacó Office Depot unas tarjeticas en venta.
las de esas de one gig two gigs.
yo fui y compré una para mi cámara.
pero yo uso la regular la S T.
Pepita en la cámara de ella u usa una que se llama dualpro o una cosa así.
mmhm.
que esa nunca la habían puesto en venta pero por fin Office Depot las puso en venta.
y ese día tenían una cosita de estas en venta también.
un Sandisk que es un M  M P three player con con un recording un radiecito F M todo una piececita.
estaba bueno.
pero cuando llegué na más que tenían el el de muestra.
no tenían ninguno allí.
pero mira before you used to go to the classes in the university.
and you used to be able to record classes.
to record not any more.
I guess not.
maybe the teachers are not.
yeah.
bueno.
they are teaching so properly that they are afraid that they might be recorded or might say something that they shouldn't say and they could.
that's that's er.
you know banish them.
tú sabes opens the door for a lawsuit si pasa cualquier cosa.
yeah.
tienen al maestro grabado un maestro que diga cualquier disparate en la clase sin querer o queriendo tú sabes lo tienen grabado.
mmhm.
pero this country has gotten.
es todo lawsuit todo lawsuit.
todo es un problema todo.
just like the lady that that chocó a Myriam because ella fue la que lo la chocó you know.
mmhm mmhm.
the lady is already her back hurts this and that everything hurts and I'm like.
oh for sure mmhm.
the one who should be hurting is my kid.
mmhm que fue la que le dieron de lado.
no que le dieron por la puerta le desbarató la puerta.
mmhm mmhm.
el axle de la de la goma de alante se la partió con eso yo te digo el golpe tan grande que le dio esa mujer.
increíble increíble.
she's just got one of these nineteen ninety five Toyotas that are like.
mmhm duro.
remember those Toyotas were really heavy?
mmhm.
and the and the bumper used to be a different color that they used to.
mmhm mmhm.
pero tipo S U V o
no no it was a car.
un carrito.
mmhm.
Thank God.
mmhm.
imagine if you for a little P T Cruiser.
imagínate.
la hubiera matado.
imagínate.
porque yo no tenía airbags en el P T Cruiser.
no.
los P T Cruisers no vienen con airbag?
yes but what happened was my my husband being such a small person wanted to buy her a car a used car didn't want her to have a new car like I told him.
get the kid a good car when we ended up finding out when we had already paid everything for the car that car had been chocado de adelante completamente.
fíjate que tiene el sticker.
mmhm.
pero parece que it wasn't in the system yet because it had just happened.
mmhm.
so they fixed the car.
and they sold it to us thinking that que no nada nada tenía el carro.
when we went to trade in the car for the Honda the guy told me that he couldn't take that car.
and we say why can't you take this car?
because that car is no good.
mmhm.
it's been crashed from the front.
mmhm.
and they put a special sticker when you open up the door of the car on the side right there.
they put a sticker when a a a car has been crashed from the front.
because of.
como un rebuilt.
yes.
mmhm.
and they wouldn't they wouldn't take the car for nothing.
ya tú sabes.
no ni lo querían.
they said no we don't want this.
this is the liability for us.
mmhm.
you try to sell it the best way you can.
and I told let's sue the guy who sold you the car.
no no no no I don't wanna worry.
sí.
you know I don't wanna deal with that.
sí.
oh ok.
but thank God.
mmhm mmhm.
hello.
are we.
I don't know if we are almost over.
we've been talking so much already.
are we are we on time?
I think they forgot about us.
keep talking.
keep on talking.
four more minutes five more minutes.
we got five more minutes.
mmhm.
we are tired talking to each other we wanna watch the news and the tv right now.
mmhm.
pues sí lo de Chili's está impresionante no verdad?
el tiroteo ese ahí en Chili's.
yes.
y los otros días el tiroteo en el colegio.
yeah.
y ayer o anteayer el el riot en el Edison.
Edison.
en en el otro.
esto está calientica la calle.
y dónde fue otro lugar aquí también que tirotearon?
los otros días aquí pegaditos nosotros.
no yo pero no fue four forty one ahí en la four forty one yo creo que fue un poquito más para allá.
no pero er estuvo Chili's.
en Chili's habían robado y habían tiroteado a alguien hace unos días atrás.
y ahora se formó un tiroteo de nuevo.
pero había otro lugar más que había habido un un robo un tiroteo.
la calle está que mete miedo.
claro.
mmhm.
la gente está desesperada.
sí.
la gente estaba desesperada para tratar de resolverlo a cualquier costo.
mmhm mmhm.
estos muchachitos se han pasado todo el día ahí pescando.
y compran.
ay at least they do.
yeah.
they are doing something better than watching er tv and computers all day.
yeah yeah.
no they'll be catch catching fish because you see them you know bringing up fish every once in a while.
mmhm.
pero ya le está cogiendo la noche y ya se van.
and are they planning on doing something on the lake like cleaning?
have you heard anything?
they haven't mentioned anything about that?
no.
no there is not.
because I think it's been a while.
I mean we've been moved in here for almost sixteen yo creo que like fifteen or sixteen years and they haven't done anything.
because you know the the thing here is that the lake doesn't belong just to one entity.
the part of the lake is the water management district.
pero then when you come from like the thirteen feet.
that that strip there el canal
mmhm.
is a water management.
but then when you come into the lake that's Miami Lakes.
is the residence of Miami Lakes in that so since it's such a mix they don't do anything.
I had a
when we first moved here not when we first moved here.
cuando fueron las elecciones de de aquí en Miami Lakes que se formó el primer viaje.
mmhm.
uno de los de los comisionados que corrió.
mmhm.
uno de los muchachitos jóvenes vino por aquí.
y le digo listen look this is a good thing for you to look at to do.
excuse me hello.
I'm in the I got five more minutes.
talking.
talking.
I'll be right there.
dile que venga para acá.
dile que venga para acá.
no déjanos acabar de hablar que nos quedan five more minutes and they are recording us bye.
we have usamos usamos este como guinea pig.
er.
qué te estaba diciendo?
oh lo del muchachito que vino aquí.
ah sí el que estaba corriendo para acá tú ves tú eso.
le digo esa basura no es basura de nosotros.
esa basura es cuando el condado o el water management district viene y limpia el pedazo de ellos.
ellos vienen con las palas.
everything.
y arrancan toda la basura.
entonces caminan tres millas con las palas para abajo rompiendo toda la hierba.
y después echan un palazo arriba del camión.
pero tú sabes cuántos palazos iban rotos por ahí que los dejan flotando.
eso es lo que tú estás viendo ahí.
dice no ahora ahora vamos a mirar esto que lo otro.
nunca han hecho nada.
cada vez que pasa el el condado por ahí con la
y pasa?
sí sí ellos pasan.
cada qué tiempo?
dos o tres veces al año vienen.
right now.
sí.
un aparato que son los que ponen allá en Red Road.
tú no te has fijado allá en la esquina del aeropuerto?
sí yo sí.
una un lugar que ponen.
ahí sí yo veo.
eso bueno.
mmhm.
esos vienen hasta aquí.
no de verdad yo no yo no me había fijado nunca.
ellos caminan por caminando.
pero qué pasa?
que ellos limpian ellos bajan la pala y van caminando y van rompiendo esa hierba.
pero en vez de hacer un pedacito cortico.
y lle llevarla hasta el camión no.
imagínate si el camión está parado a cuatro cuadras.
tú crees que ellos van a a recoger un poquito y llevarlo y botarlo y regresarlo.
ellos ponen la pala y van rompiendo van empujándola para allá.
pero lo que hace después.
que se se queda toda suelta se riega todo.
y cuando el aire sopla de allá o de aquí.
toda esa hierba muerta.
va cayendo para acá.
mmhm.
y yo le echo ahí cosas.
y fumigó y eso para mantener la hierba lo menos que no crezca mucho pero con todo y eso.
er te encuentras que que los lily pads crecen.
y y se mete la basura ahí.
y vaya.
le echas hoy y a los dos o tres meses ya están de nuevo floreciendo y creciendo.
so.
y la señora de al lado tiene ahora un nieto no.
un nieto.
mmhm.
ah sí.
sí el nieto está viviendo con ella.
qué bueno así no está solita.
tú sabes que yo pensaba que los hijos de Lucía las las hijas de los hijos vivían fuera de Miami.
pero este este vive en Core Gables.
really?
el hijo de ella el hijo de ella que es el papá del nieto vive en Core Gables.
porque como yo nunca los veía por aquí ni nada.
he must have gotten in a fight.
I'm gonna go live with my grandma porque siempre dicen así.
es posible.
es posible tú no te acuerdas hace como dos o tres años atrás cuando primero se mudó ahí que tenía un carrito que lo chocó.
mmhm.
que Lucía lo tuvo tapado ahí mucho tiempo.
mmhm.
er le le taparon le chocaron el carro.
y parece que el padre estaba bravo con ellos y no se lo arregló ni nada.
y estaba parado ahí en casa de Lucía todo ese tiempo.

para todo lo que tiene que ver con psychology tú no puedes empezar sin masters.
en todas las escuelas todos los counsellors.
y ella no tiene master todavía?
she has the bachelor.
ya.
pero en todas las escuelas si tú quieres ir de school counsellor you have to have a masters in psychology en en behavioural education or one of these things like that.
y no lo va no lo va a sacar?
but it has to be a masters.
yeah.
but I'm gonna finish school.
she's gonna start school.
and then I think I'm gonna either go to law school.
I have three options right now.
and I'm so undecided.
I don't know.
I'm either gonna do law school my M b a.
or I'm gonna do a doctorate in my field because I have the masters done in my field.
I did a bachelors in computer sciences and in management information systems which was from the school of business.
my master now it's in management is a master of science in management information systems.
so es todo tecnología.
ah no sí ahora todo es.
that's what I did.
so puedo seguir en ese camino con dos años más.
y sacar el sacar el doctoral.
doctorado.
mmhm.
está bien.
but the problem is they require a residency that you go do research with them.
that's the problem.
ay pero tú lo puedes hacer.
tú eres smart.
olvídate que eso es
I like it.
and that's the thing.
if you like something it's easy.
oh yeah yeah it's easy for you.
Jack y y entonces ya empezaron a buscar muebles o todavía?
no.
everything is there.
they painted.
laid tile.
put the baseboards.
and put all the muebles.
ah ya lo tienen allí?
yeah the whole thing ya está puesto.
ah yo pensé que ahora iban a empezar a comprarlos.
no I closed march third or march fourth.
and we had bought everything.
so we had all the delivery set up.
but I had to get the tile laid.
so they finished tile last week.
and then her grandfather painted.
her grandfather started painting right after that.
and he's almost done.
and then we started to installing the furniture Friday.
Friday they started to deliver it.
but Friday we had a big day like six people did deliveries.
so I was like one after the other.
y todo el mundo entrando.
y ya le han puesto todo en su lugar y todo?
y colocando.
más o menos.
ya.
yeah none of the the electronics are in.
and we still have to do
we have this guy.
I don't know if you've noticed.
but there's in my mom's house there's this ceiling.
that's all wood.
and the guy who made that.
he made it from scratch by hand the whole thing.
is this Brazilian guy that's a woodworker.
and he's just gifted.
that's what he does.
yeah.
se la pasa ahí con cortando cortando cortando.
and he does all the stuff.
so he's building the closet.
and he built.
they wanted to charge us like fifteen thousands dollars to do one of these closets that's very modular.
and everything's super organized.
olvídate like he's doing the closet for peanuts.
and it's the same.
when you gonna see Oliver's.
ok.
Oliver's closet.
it's awesome.
y qué es lo que es?
amigo de tu mamá?
no y es un contrator ya.
he's a contractor that has he did my grandmother stuff.
he did my mom's stuff.
we use him on everything because the guy is super responsible you know like we are.
and and he does his stuff.
and and he knows his stuff.
he got us the tile guy because the tile guy was expensive.
pero está quedando bonito?
pero
they came out perfect.
they came out perfect.
they came up beautiful they came up beautiful.
pero the tile guy you know had to lay the tile like marble.
lo que pasa.
lo que pasa Jack es que todo eso se demora.
so
they did it in a week.
te dicen una semana.
they did it in a week.
they did the whole tile in a week.
ah bueno.
they brought like nine people con las máquinas con los las bolsas de cemento lo que con todo.
and right there boom boom con otros tipos marcando otros tipos cortando.
and they just went.
and they finished it in a week.
I couldn't believe it.
they laid the tile perfect.
perfect perfect perfect.
that it's beautiful.
but when when you go to the balcony you see that they really looked at it from end to end and they laid everything so in line.
you know really really nice very very clean.
you know what I mean?
y qué es lo que tienen de de vista la el la calle o la la bahía.
tenemos los dos lados.
tenemos el mar.
el mar.
adelante.
que es el el la vista principal donde están las puertas.
entonces el cuarto de ella da al aeropuerto.
al lado mirando al oeste.
ya.
it's awesome.
está bueno.
and it's on the twenty seventh floor.
imagínate.
so you're like everything's right there.
when what we see like if you drew a line straight out it would be the hard rock in Bay side.
that's like a line straight off from our balcony.
because the building is at an angle.
so if you say that this is we look like this.
ok this is the building.
we're on this side.
um.
so we look like towards.
the other side of the building looks like up the.
yeah.
you know what I mean?
like up towards north Miami Beach.
sí sí.
yo sé dónde está eso.
entonces está bonito todo.
it really is.
it's very small.
it's very small.
small?
very very small.
y eso?
tienes dos dos cuartos.
it has two bedrooms.
it has like a library like a den which is our office where we're putting the the sofa bed and we're putting the computers and that stuff.
and then it has the living room the kitchen the the two bathrooms and the entry way and the balcony.
that's it.
yeah.
it's not a lot of space.
bueno pero.
it's about thirty hundred and fifty square feets.
so when you think about that that's a lot of space.
mmhm.
Jack pero para tú sabes.
para empezar.
no and we didn't know Oliver was coming when we made the commitment.
when we put the deposit we didn't know Oliver was coming.
right.
well.
so we're super happy you know.
pero.
with her we're fine.
just with one more fine.
sí seguimos para el segundo?
olvídate.
estamos jodidos.
por ahí se se aparece otro.
menos mal que
no no no no no no no.
bueno una cama de litera.
lo que yo creo que como lo estamos preparando lo podemos alquilar por dos mil quinientos.
y a lo mejor cargar los restos que serán un poquito más y
and and move or rent in a house or something I guess you know.
you figure it out.
sí mijo sí.
you always figure it out.
el mercado está duro eso sí.
siempre siempre aparece una opción que uno pueda hacer.
ya.
no aho ahora la situación no está ni pa vender ni pa comprar ni
porque lo que pasa es que si compras
pero después cuando vienen lo todo todo lo que se pega.
la locura de antes.
es que aquí se volvieron locos Jack.
locos.
entonces los bancos los bancos entonces le daban préstamo a gente que no calificaban.
no había razón.
a todos.
porque no ganaban lo suficiente para poder pagar ese.
tú sabes y entonces ahora un embarque que todo el mundo está
everybody's screwed.
it's like musical chairs and who's gonna get stuck without the chair.
you know then when the music stop.
quién se queda afuera.
who's screwed.
a ver quién se queda afuera.
oh my god.
eso mismo es.
eso mismo es qué de cosa.
imagínate y la gente está con las casas dice tú tía Ramírez que por.
may I?
sí sí yo tengo más ahí.
que por la por la casa del barrio de ella dice que hay cantidad de casas on foreclosure.
malísimo está la cosa.
foreclosure?
get outta here.
my grandmother sold at a perfect time.
mira.
the perfect.
ella se puso con un suerte Jack porque imagínate.
the perfect time.
if she would not have sold that the pressure everybody would be under right now the stress that everybody would be carrying.
no y después tu tío se quedó sin trabajo.
y oye
no thank god thank god he has a great job now.
thank god she found her place.
and she's all set up.
yeah.
everybody is squared away.
because if they woulda stayed with the house holy shit.
no no pueden no pueden dormir.
no no no.
yo te voy a decir que esto la situación nada nada buena.
por eso tú sabes uno tiene que tratar de gastar lo menos posible.
la gente no entienden con los foreclosures.
se va tremendo cantidad de property taxes.
pero claro.
que no se lo van a pagar.
claro quién lo va a pagar si están perdiendo la casa.
quién lo va a pagar.
y todos los servicios van a quedar cortos de todo.
los bancos están imagínate.
but the city the municipalities are all gonna come up short on their budgets.
they're not gonna be able to make it because who's how are they're gonna do it?
que empiecen a a bajar los sueldos a a toda esa gente que ganan bastante dinero.
that's never gonna happen.
ah bueno pues entonces.
in the history of man people don't go down not if they can help it.
bueno pero tú sabes.
toda esta gente que tienen ahí en lo los directores de esto de aquello todo gente del condado todos ganan doscientos mil pesos al año.
tú sabes?
entonces eso es un dinero que
no and in Miami two hundred thousand dollars?
to know go buy a house.
five hundred thousand dollars.
you gotta make tremendous money.
no puedes.
and oye a house now is five hundred thousand dollars.
three hundred thousand dollars now actually you can get a decent house for.
pero decent houses or starter house.
el muchachito este de al lado puso la casa a vender.
pero
yeah.
tú sabes qué?
they told me.
setecientos mil dólares.
quién le va a dar eso?
setecientos o ochocientos creo que están pidiendo por la casa.
cómo está la situación ahora?
no creo Jack que
the you know what though?
the danger is how much it comes down to.
but the fact is if he even comes close to that what you guys have if you guys can get a comp now at that price this neighbourhood is gonna stay great.
that's a heck of a selling price.
gracias a dios que nosotros compramos esta casa.
that was a home run.
porque.
that was a grand slam.
sí.
que mira no a veces.
oye ganaste ganaste el juego.
ese ese es el.
oye.
that one at bat.
olvídate.
and that's how it is.
that's how it is.
look at that.
that's
y aquí lo que nos quedan por pagar son cinco años ya.
que si dios quiere vaya.
cuando nos retiremos ya esté paga.
porque si no imagínate.
no no no that's a great feeling.
that's a great feeling.
no Jack esto está
tú ves las personas por ahí que se se retiran.
y después tienen que seguir trabajando porque no no les alcanza.
no way no.
los pobres viejos estos se están comiendo tremendo cable.
yo no sé.
yo no sé.
men.
es algo vaya uno como que de queda un poco loco.
esto está que uno se pone loco oíste.
pero bueno.
y Carla como se porta Jack?
she's interesting.
se porta bien?
yeah.
she has her days.
she has.
she's all over the place.
you see everything.
you see everything.
it's like the rainbow.
you see everything.
she's so amazing though.
she's so amazing.
qué linda.
pero óyeme.
if I can do anything in the world right now I would take care of her all the time.
y qué?
that's what I would do.
if I had if I had a million dollars.
ven acá y quién va a pagar lo del condominio?
yo.
ten more years in my business and I'll be able to step back a lot more.
but
y y está bien el negocio?
yeah.
we're at five years.
we're at five years.
and It's a we did almost two millions dollars in sales last year.
and that's of selling labor.
of our hours.
like we charge a hundred and seventy five an hour more less.
and this year we'll probably sell like two and a half millions.
wow.
yeah it's amazing.
we are like at the highest level.
of partnership with Microsoft.
we're Microsoft gold manage partners.
mm.
and they give us a lot of the customers now.
and they give us money to do marketing.
and they give us money to do events and host things and all sort of stuff.
so that's really it.
we do a lot of Microsoft Cisco and two other companies that also are really high in technology.
and we do all sorts of customers.
we have like thirty car dealerships.
we had a lot of real estate customers that have all died.
no ahora todos están
all the developers are almost out of business.
we we had seventeen I think we have like two left.
yeah.
it's incredible.
that whole market that whole vertical has just gone.
no todo.
y y tú sabes y con eso las cosas todo todo es una cadena porque Homedepot está que no está vendiendo porque a nadie no hay ventas nadie arregla casas nadie
uhuh.
porque cuando tú compras una casa tú le quieres hacer esto nuevo aquello nuevo y esto.
y entonces eso es el dinero como se mueve.
pero si nadie está haciendo nada
no and and it's not cheap.
and and there's not people buying houses and flipping houses and building houses.
so even though that it's a great opportunity to make money there it's not there.
you're right.
it's invisible.
los jardines la gente de que hace jardines también dice que.
tú sabes.
sufriendo.
que no hay.
ahí es donde cortan.
ahí corta.
sabes todas las cositas así ahora.
y tú vas ahora al periódico y ya esas cosas.
y tú ves que hablan de how you cut cost how you're gonna reduce your monthly expenditures where can you save three hundred dollars a month.
you know.
and they show you how to penny pinch.
claro.
cositas aquí aquí.
y todo el mundo lo está haciendo.
yeah you you take you stretch out the cleaning.
instead of this and all the stuff.
and before you know it you you save three or four hundred dollars a month that if you put into something you are saving money.
mmhm.
and saving money is the hardest thing to do.
that's the hardest thing to do because there's no extra there is never extra.
vas al grocery coño
coño coño trescientos trescientos.
yo no salgo de ahí sin gastar trescientos.
fíjate que siempre yo siempre hacía aquí lo lo los weekends.
tú sabes siempre hacía comida.
y venían a comer y eso.
ya yo eso no lo hago.
el perió el periódico hoy tenía tremendo artículo.
lo hago una vez pero porque no se puede.
mmhm I'm sorry.
pero no se puede.
the Sunday Herald today had a big section on how the price of food is going up exponentially.
here and around the world because oats and wheat have through the roof.
oh yeah uhuh.
they're.
and the other thing that's gone really high is corn because people are now using it to make the gas the ethanol.
right?
so a lot of people are buying corn so it's creating competition and demand and all these areas that are driving.
mm.
oye the the people that are General Mills that do the oat and the wheats they make all the cereals.
I know.
like every time their cost goes up like like by a dollar on the on the market the cost of our cereal goes up by a penny.
yeah.
and that'll jump twenty dollars and boom.
they have to raise it twenty cents on the cost.
la leche.
the milk.
cinco pesos.
no no no and now everybody is buying organic.
so that's like six dollars.
they they get you.
te clavan.
sí.
por donde quieran te cogen.
no pero tú sabes que nosotros nos quejamos Jack aquí.
y es verdad que la cosa está dura.
pero tenemos la oportunidad.
pero
si lo quieres está ahí.
sí pero que te quiero decir en Europa la gente está pagando carísimo por la gasolina.
más que aquí.
oh bastante más casi el doble por más que el doble con todo los impuestos que hay que poner.
mucho más.
mucho más que aquí.
pero en Europa están haciendo cosas tan interesantes que aquí por toda la complicación de políticos del sistema de mierda que tenemos que es mejor que exista pero mierda.
si tú miras a Alemania.
Alemania tiene un programa que le pagan a la gente que pueden producir energía.
y y entregar la energía al sistema energético del de la ciudad o de la de la del del condado lo que sea.
so la gente ahora están comprando.
y poniendo en todas partes en su casa.
para ahorrar en
y el día entero tú vas produciendo.
mmhm.
y entregándolo al sistema.
ah the grid you're contributing power into the grid.
claro.
all day.
and your and your meter is basically rolling backward and you're getting charged credited.
and then at night it uses electricity.
sí.
right?
pero your people in Germany know that they passed the law that's good for twenty years that every like kilowatt that you put back is twenty cents or twenty five cents or something fixed.
so now farmers are building fields.
como tú te das cuenta donde viven los abuelos.
y y tenía uno por la finca.
ajá.
tú te acuerdas?
con la finca.
los los fields of paint.
ajá.
they look just like that but they're fields of solar panel.
and they collect energy all day.
right?
and they sell that energy back to this grid because the government is the one that has is paying a subsidy.
right?
sí lo está.
for any body.
lo está subsidiando para que
that wants to do it.
and that is saving so much ener energy production that that's less coal less oil less you know natural gas less whatever.
sí.
y después una dependencia de del del petróleo que es increíble.
y el sol no se acaba.
hoy sol hay más que bastante.
y más que pasa el tiempo mejor se va a poner la tecnología.
y más energía tú vas a poder colectar.
so vamos a decir hoy en una pulgada cuadrado tú puedes recoger tal energía cada hora.
eso va a seguir subiendo.
y en el mismo espacio.
tú vas a poder colectar doble diez veces cien veces.
they have to do something about it because you know eh.
no this is crazy.
it's crazy yeah.
this crazy er.
and now you have China and all these other countries that are exploding with growth.
yeah.
and they're where we were fifty years ago.
so they're gonna start expending and burning and using so much.
that we have to switch.
because if not we're gonna get pulled back for them to move forward.
there's interesting things that I've I've read about you know how everything.
there's a book called it's a flat world that talks about how the whole world is now because of the way technology and everything is we're all in a little village.
and what one person does affects the other one.
claro que sí.
and everybody's gotta realize we have such direct impact.
we're not often little islands any more.
it's not like that.
even if you're you know ninety miles it's nothing.
a hundred miles you know a hundred thousands miles you know.
sí sí con la tecnología que hay ahora muchacho.
it's a.
esto es increíble.
pero todo es a base de tecnología.
qué increíble no?
las cosas que se pueden hacer.
eso.
esas cositas lo lo teléfonos que ustedes tienen.
que tienen de todo ahí adentro.
de todo de todo trae de todo.
lo que casi te piensan hacen la pensamiento para uno para no tener que hacer nada.
uhuh.
mira en mi teléfono yo tengo mi calendario entero que la gente en mi oficina tienen acceso.
y todo el mundo maneja poner las cosas en mi calendario cuando hay cita a meeting o lo que sea.
yo tengo sincronizado el teléfono con la computadora en la oficina con los servidores que yo pueda accesar de cualquier computadora por el web todos mis contactos todos mis contactos.
so I have everybody's information in there.
then I have all my email.
in my email when you call my cellular phone and you leave a voice mail right it records a computer file that puts that into my email.
right and then I listen to all my voice mail on my email.
so I sit down once a week or whatever.
just grab all my email that are voice mail.
and I listen to them.
or my faxes.
the faxes all come in when you send it you hear the number.
it's sounds like a regular fax machine.
pero it captures it in the computer.
and puts it in my email.
and it's a P d f.
and then I can look in the faxes.
so everything's right there.
everything's in my phone.
I can look at the P d f on my phone.
I can look at the fax on my phone any time.
I can listen to the voice mail because the email's on the phone.
está bueno eso.
the email's on the phone.
you know how.
you use Microsoft outlook at work?
yeah.
you know how you have the tasks?
like the to do's?
those synchronize on my phone.
and on my phone I have the tasks synchronized with the computer of the office.
so wherever I am it's the tasks.
all that stuff as you tie it together it.
you know I remember when everybody used to remember all the telephone numbers.
I know.
right?
or you had a little black book o la cosita donde tú le movías para la letra y.
salía todo.
salía.
te acuerdas?
yeah I know.
el nombre el teléfono.
todo.
but that stuff now is in that little device.
but now you look at Mary's.
the I Phone.
it has a camera that is full of megapixels.
when we went to the island I bought a camera for like a thousand dollars that was great.
a Sony camera several years ago.
sí esa fue cuando fueron.
tú te acuerdas?
cuando fuimos en el.
the camera in her phone now is better than that one.
the camera in her phone it's a higher megapixel and better quality camera than that one was.
and it's this big.
it's microscopic.
it's a speakerphone.
it has the the I Pod it's in the phone.
so she has eight gigabytes of music which is at least a few hundred songs maybe a few thousands songs.
Jack pero es que a mí me compran un teléfono de esos y yo no sé ni que voy a hacer con él.
no no no I haven't I haven't even started.
it has a G p s with a map software.
so when you drive it'll tell you where to go.
it'll actually talk to you.
and tell you.
make a left here.
make a right here.
lo hace todo el teléfono.
estoy perdido.
you can go buy stock.
they sell stock on the phone.
through the same thing that is a mary trader or any of these places where you do it from your computer.
the internet on the telephone is so incredible.
tú te imaginas que tú miras un telefonito así.
y tú no ves nada.
es tan pequeño.
yeah.
so they develop the technology that ah.
I'll have to show you this on the phone.
then when you look at the web page tú coges tus dedos.
y si tú lo observaras así it zooms you in.
and if you do this it zooms you out.
and you can move around the page.
so you zoom in.
and if you touch like the link like on the internet if you touch the hyperlink te entra.
pero todo es con tu dedo.
it's incredible.
it's so natural.
to use it's so easy.
like it's intuitive.
and that's what makes Apple different.
all of the Apple products are very natural.
they're very intuitive.
they.
I'm a Microsoft company.
I know what Microsoft does.
it's great for business.
but for just being easy to use and enjoyable man the Apple stuff.
tú coges el teléfono de allá cuando tú estabas oyendo la música.
tú lo pones al lado.
y te cambia.
sabe que tú lo pusiste al lado.
ahí te abre todos los albums.
y todos los covers de todos los albums.
y tú le das así.
y te va cambiando las páginas al mirar todos los albums.
tú tocas el cover del álbum que tú quieres.
y lo haces al revés.
y tú ves la lista de todas las canciones.
mm.
tocas la canción.
y te lo y te te lo.
te lo tengo que enseñar.
it's amazing it's amazing.
pero that's where everything is going like.
it's amazing.
tú sabes ahora.
tú usas Google?
sí.
te vas a Google tú.
type una palabra.
y te lo lleva.
ahora hay algo que está en lo que es beta.
mejor.
beta es como un testing
que ha salido al público.
es que creo que quedan como novecientos oportunidades para beta testers.
se llama Searchme dot com.
que es igualito al Google.
pero hace algo muy diferente.
cuando tú pones los las palabras.
y tú haces search.
en vez de entregártelo en una lista de palabras
te lo da en previews of the website.
so you actually see the website.
and then you hit to the the arrow on the keyboard.
y te lo lleva al próximo website.
the next arrow boom al próximo website.
the next arrow boom al próximo website.
so you can see everything like if you were flipping through a catalogue you're seeing already the front of the web page.
so when you're looking for something if you can see the visuals.
claro.
oh that's exactly what I'm looking for boom and you're there.
so instead of presenting it to you in a word list of all of the blue links with all the words and all that stuff it's giving you the website.
but on the bottom if you still wanna see the words you press button.
y te abren todas las palabras at the bottom.
and you can scroll through the box on the bottom.
it's Searchme dot com and it's really really good.
pero eso lo están testing ahora.
yeah they're testing they're testing.
and it's an interesting engine.
that's the question.
is will the engine of what they bring back when you type a word in be as advanced in the algorithm as Google is.
if it is then you have something really unique.
because that's what it's a visual component with a very powerful search engine.
Google is a very powerful search engine.
it gives you good returns like when you put something in it gets close to what you're looking for.
it is a good process.
and think about it.
their software Google.
it's a software.
uhuh.
that it's a giant company right?
hundreds of billions of dollars.
but their software scans the entire internet.
esa no era la que Microsoft estaba tratando de comprar?
everyday.
no they're trying to buy Yahoo.
ya.
who's Google's biggest competitor.
but the Yahoo owners the board of directors that runs the company says it's too little money.
they offered forty two billion.
they said it's too little.
they said no for forty two billion.
coño.
yeah.
you're talking about a company that didn't exist ten years ago.
yo sé.
yo sé.
and then forty two billion's too little.
sí porque antes era solamente Microsoft internet.
and that's it.
yeah I know know and
Microsoft's good.
Microsoft knows how to win.
and specially when Microsoft's coming in second place they know how to jump and beat the guy in first place.
they're not very good at being in the first place from the beginning.
Apple is very good at being in first place at the beginning.
Apple is really really interesting.
está bueno.
yeah yeah yeah.
pero bueno.
no no no y
el costo de la capacidad para procesar sigue bajando.
so hoy en día tú compras una computadora.
que tú te acuerdas la computadora que nosotros teníamos en el cuartico en la casa vieja?
tú sabes qué?
ajá.
tú estás hablando hoy de una computadora que tiene mil veces la potencia.
la capacidad y el
those computers used to be able to process like twelve million instructions per second right?
these are gigahertz computers.
these can do like four billion instructions per second.
and when anything can calculate that fast
you know
I can't think what it can calculate.
you know.
ven acá cómo cuánto cuesta un laptop?
para qué?
para mi papá?
para el cumpleaños de tu papá.
oh my god.
el cumpleaños de tu papá es la semana que viene.
I know I know.
es que
no para comprar.
yo se la compro.
pero más o menos cómo en cuánto están ahora algo así que le.

cuando fuimos al camping Mary estaba moviendo la maleta atrás en el carro para sacar el coche.
y el laptop se se cayó de la maleta en el piso.
tremendo it was banged up.

so I took it over there.
and they fixed it right away.
and they are people that I'm doing business with too.

lo único que tiene es eso que no le está cargando la la la batería.
parece que tiene un contacto ahí que no.
tú sabes que no coge bien.

we're gonna have a black president.
and not only that we're gonna have a a total change in everything.
taxes are gonna go up like crazy.

sí porque los los demócratas dicen que son del pueblo.
pero son los que más taxes suben oíste?
yeah.
you have to pay for everything.
they wanna give everybody your money.
no.
pero por qué?
por qué aquí tiene que existir un welfare para mantener a la gente?
un welfare es para ayudarte a encaminarte esto un año o dos años.
recogerte vaya.

entonces las mujeres éstas pariendo.
tienen todos los años tienen un hijo.
no tienen marido.
yo no sé los hijos cómo los hacen.
entonces?
hay que mantenerle el muchacho.
mientras más hijos tienen más dinero le dan.
no trabajan.
y quién es?
los demócratas son los responsables de eso.
porque yo entiendo que a una persona hay que ayudarla.
no y Barack Barack es tremendo demócrata.
ese es un tremendo come mierda.
y ese lo que trae es una agenda muy oscura muy escondida oíste?
escondida.
y él escondido.
él es un político como cualquier.
y tú sabes qué?
que no se tire mucho porque tú sabes que vaya.
él es igualito.
eso del del momento que empezó ha ha estado ahí la la lucecita roja.
los los los pollitos rojos esos tú sabes que no son muy suaves.
no no no no.
cuando no le convenga la cosa vaya.
no no no no no olvídate.
que ponga a Hillary de vicepresidente.
entonces nadie porque nadie quiere a ella.
ella es peor todavía.
nadie lo mata porque peor quedarse con ella.
esa mujer sí trae
no no no no she's a shark.

he was just there for the ride.
and he's just a great talker.
man he's charismatic.
he's very charismatic.
he is.
and he's a natural speaker.
and he's got a gift to connect with people.
but he's a tremendous party animal.
and a bullshitter.
and he's someone that.
he's a politician when whenever he had to make a decision he'd look around and then he'd say.
no if you do that they're gonna kick your ass if you do that
so he just did whatever the easy thing was.
but sometimes you gotta do some fucked up shit.
lo que es.
cómo es?
políticamente correcto.
mira.
nosotros cagamos Somalia cuando era presidente.
entramos ahí.
después de eso en Kenya creo que es los Tutsis y los Hulis mataron ocho cientos mil personas en como cuarenta días.

he knows how to work everybody.
and that's it.
you want somebody that can work the whole field the left the right the middle everybody.
he's a true politician you know.
and he understands if he just says everything right there out there you know his bus is called the straight talk express.
because that's what he says.

I'm talking to you straight.
that's right.
there's nothing hidden over here.

we close at seven.
well Clare said
so call her right now.
I said.
you know Clare doesn't do orientations.
but I can call my office right now.
so I picked up the phone.
and Magdalena.
I said.
Magdalena I have someone she's finished closing.
and they told her to cross the street and that you would do an orientation.
Magdalena says.
no I'm closed.
I can't do an orientation.
I was told not to do any overtime.
so I proceeded to hang up the phone.
and I said.
I'm so sorry.
tut the office is closed.
there's not much I can do.
and she just got all wired up.
and she's like.
call Clare call Clare!
and as she does this her boyfriend sees how or her friend I don't know if boyfriend or friend
did you call Clare?

she was calling her on her cellphone.
oh.
and you know I picked up the phone.
I gave her the number.
and she's verified the number that she had.
and I said.
yeah that's that's the number.
so I hang up my phone and let her call her.
she her boyfriend said.
well let's just go across the street.
so they went across the street.
and got Clare.
well Clare was Clare.
walks all you know huffing and puffing.

Jacob
hey wait a second.
let me finish my story.

ok so this whole story right.
and then this morning she came.
again?
well yeah because we didn't do the orientation yesterday.
mmhm.
and um she made a complaint against me!
so Karen calls me.
and she says.
um I have a resident who just made a complaint about you.
and I said.
well Karen um that's why I came into the office this morning at ten thirty to tell you I needed to speak to you.
she's like.
oh is it on the report?
I said.
it sure is.
it's on the report today and yesterday.
she says.
well we need to extend more courtesy.
I said.
hold on one second.
did you see how excited she is?
did you know how upset she was yesterday?
because they kept her four hours just sitting there waiting for Clare.
she's like.
oh you're right.
ok well
she's like.
ok you yeah I think you ok you did fine.
and that was it.
but yeah Karen was at first you know just dumping it on me.
and I was like um this woman
I wasn't gonna stay.
and and and and yeah
I don't do orientation.
I was like.
, and and right in the front desk?
where you're sitting is Karen's telephone number?
yeah but no.
it wasn't my place to call Karen.
it would already.
no you don't have to call nobody.
you just give the card to her.
no no I did.
I gave I gave her the office card.
and she didn't want it.
she wanted Clare.
so she went and got Clare.
end of story.
but then this morning she was complaining about me.
and I was like.
why was she complaining about me?
it's not my office.
I don't do orientation.
she's like.
well I guess because you didn't call Clare.
and I was like.
why do I have to call Clare?
she had her on the cellphone.
so anyways that was what happened today.
so I was a little annoyed.
but then I was like.
ah I'll get over it.
what's the worst thing that can happen to me?
I'll just walk across the street.
and ask the engineer there if they can give me a job.
actually if they offer me twelve thirteen I will walk across the street.
yeah it's the same
same shit.
same tren?
same shit different.
that's true it's the same train!
I can just hop on and hop off at the same time.
on Friday I have to go with you.
where?
at seven.
you have to go with me at seven?
at seven into work.
why?
because I'm covering for Claudio.
ah.
estaba de lo más emocionado.
estaba feliz feliz.
dice que eh le dieron ese internship.
el qué?
el internship.
uhhuh.
está como un intern.
no le pagan.
pero le dejan estar ahí en el estudio.
dice él que que no you know él nunca ha hecho nada así.
pero que tiene que entrar ver si todo está limpio que si algo falta que si esto aquello que llame que que él verifique.
le ponen una secretaria.
pero él está en el estudio que es donde él quiere estar.
bueno por lo menos va a hacer algo que le guste.
sí.
y a ver qué sale de ahí después.
yo no sabía que él estaba viviendo con su mamá.
sí?
por eso es que está fajado con el padrastro.
pues si el padrastro es la misma edad de él.
cómo no va a estar fajado con ella?
no.
es el espacio y la tensión.
de quién del marido o del hijo?
de la mamá!
pero papi eso es
y aún.
son dos relaciones diferentes!
bueno él está molesto porque la mamá le está prestando atención no es la misma atención cuando estaba sola que ahora cuando él
claro.
pero por eso es que está molesto.
ah por eso se
ven acá chico pero y esto creo que va a seguir.
es por que la luz.
está bright.
we can move over there if you want.
no.
you wanna move to the sofa?
no.
ok.
oh well so the only reason I kind of figured it out was because she said.
oh yeah Claudio cooked.
I'm like.
how can Claudio cook?
Claudio went home.
and I'm thinking.
oh Claudio went home.
home home.
mommy's house.
so anyways.
ah Jack I need you to call the people for the title.
sí what is it for?
I don't know the phone number.
you need to tell them you paid ten dollars for them to do a title search.
yeah.
the lady says we'll call you don't call us.
she could've just put those ten dollars in her pocket.
she gave me a receipt though.
I don't know where's the receipt right now.
ok ah I'm so glad she gave you a receipt.
in that receipt's surely there is a telephone number?
maybe.
well could you find it please?
I'll find it yeah.
I need to know what the hell is going on with that.
did I show you how much I got paid?
I didn't get paid as much as you!
but I think this is four hours short.
so last week you were four hours short.
this week I'm four hours short.
because remember that day of training?
they only paid me for four hours.
so that's gonna be eight.
but it doesn't matter because that's what they pay.
this is what this is what counts.
this is what the number that we got to look at.
seven eight nine.
pones un pones un cien aquí y aquí y son los son iguales.
you think?
siete y siete catorce.
y después lo sumas esto para acá atrás y este acá atrás.
alright.
entonces le pongo aquí la cantidad entera?
ninety five.
and then here it is four four.
and seven six.
that would be nine.
qué es esto?
qué número es esto?
that's a two!
oh.
so five and four.
esos números que tú estás haciendo no se entienden.
and four is nine carry the one.
no no don't carry nothing.
nine and four thirteen and that's four.
because it's fi fi and and four is nine!
oh my god.
why you have to carry something?
because I don't carry you carry.
ah?
ok nine that's thirteen carry the one six seven eight nine.
and that would be eight.
and that would be
ocho pones
fourteen.
uhhuh.
ok so that's what we have right now.
and upstairs I have about that much.
and then there's another envelope with that.
that would be nine.
that's still eight.
esto cuentas esto aquí no más y ya.
cuatro.
cinco seis siete ocho nueve.
siete nueve.
ok so that's what I have right now.
what!
que te cuesta trabajo.
busca la facilidad.
I know but I'm always getting used to.
ah pero tienes que buscarla.
just counting one two three four.
I don't know.
I'm slow with that.
este grande no lo haces.
estos tres que están aquí no hacen uno grandote.
entonces tú pones el uno ahí.
cuentas esto cuatro.
how do I know without actually counting that?
makes no sense.
ok so anyways.
I'm I'm sure this can be rounded off but
round it off to cuánto to nueve?
in the I can round it off to two.
just two period.
no ah para abajo mejor no para arriba.
acomódate tú.
ok forget that.
I don't have to do that.
ok listen.
this is what I need right now.
this is right.
this is insurance.
and this is car payment.
that would be four and eleven right?
uhhuh.
don't laugh at me weirdo.
now I still have no idea what the registration to your vehicle is.
salud.
you're so piggish.
ok so
rent insurance car.
so I still have.

that's only because you want to eat at a restaurant.
if I have to cook it's not so much.
no it didn't have to be in the restaurant.
what do you wanna do?
I'm talking about something that I like to eat.
what would you like to eat?

sí porque la salsa es de la carne.
like chilli?
salsa de los bisteces que traen la salsa la grasita con el bistec.
o de la otro.
o si no coges un poco de frijoles nada.
tú sabes entre salsita y salsita se va un pedacito de carne también.
y entonces coges el bicho.
y lo pones.
y lo cierras.
y vas para donde el tipo y le dice.
dime cuánto es?
uno veinticinco.
ok.
esto Pablito me estaba diciendo que a ella le gustaba.
porque te podías poner lo que
el plato de ella le costó dos dólares cincuenta centavos.
no no no y y tú te echas lo que te da la gana.
eso es lo que ella dijo también.
ella dice no.
tú coges una cazuela ahí.
ay dios mío.
entonces tengo esta cantidad.
lo que por ejemplo hay una
esa es mi cantidad para poner registración comida y lo demás.
ya ves?
la comida se van cien pesos.
que qué?
cien pesos dónde?
el refrigerador.
ese refrigerador no se llena con cien pesos.
con menos?
más.
pero no hay que llenarlo tampoco.
no es una misión llenarlo.
ok está bien.
oh ah.
pero ahora ponte a pensar.
no lo lleno.
ok está bien.
tú has visto el refrigerador ahora?
qué tiene?
nada.
no tiene nada?
dos huevos creo que hay.
hay que comprar huevos entonces entonces.
ya.
hay que comprar huevos!
pero es lo que te digo que
hemos estado apretando you know aquí apretando allá.
te dije me me van a durar dos paychecks más dos dos pagos.
van a estar aproximadamente aquí.
este es el veintiocho tres veintiocho.
la primera renta se paga este mes.
éste es éste.
y después aquí.
esa es la primera renta.
ahí es donde vamos a saber cómo estamos financially.
ya.
desde este momento al segundo que viene siendo veintiocho probablemente como el trece.
déjame ver.
alright.
si me pagan el veintiocho entonces el próximo míralo aquí viene siendo el once.
y me gustaría estar adelantada un poquito.
entonces siete y siete son catorce verdad?
yup.
entonces son mil cuatrocientos lo cual me quedan doscientos veinticinco como crédito.
te acuerdas que ayer estábamos hablando de que si podemos
si puedo yo aunque sea quedarme sin pagar renta un mes por adelantarme así para que cuando los niños vengan yo puedo pagar para llevarlos a Disneyworld un ratito.
a Disneyworld un ratico?
sí.
what does that mean?
no pero solamente por un día o dos días.
por un día no?
no ten tengo que quedarme una noche con ellos.
imagínate tú tener que manejar cinco horas.
ah sales el sales el viernes y llega el domingo.
salimos el viernes todos.
no quieres ir?
sí si no hay nada que hacer.
y vamos a salir con la niña y después con el niño.
no entiendo eso.
vamos a ir a Disneyworld when the baby and later when the boy?
sí porque ella no viene al mismo tiempo.
ah so we have to go two times?
well yeah it'll be fun.
she's thirteen fourteen.
she's not going to like the same things that he likes.
he's seventeen oh almost seventeen.
that's gonna be a real challenge.
why?
look.
they start in June twenty fifth.
say that I bring her the first week.
it doesn't matter.
if I bring her or him the first week hasta August.
tengo junio julio y agosto si lo separo.
esto es una semana.
y una semana no importa en qué mes julio o agosto para el niño.
creo que el niño se va a querer quedar más.
for how long she coming?
she only comes for one week.
that's what she told me.
and for how do you think that she he he he is gonna be here longer than her?
he's gonna want to stay longer.
like uh two weeks?
like three months.
like three months?
oh my.
I don't know.
he was talking about some stuff.
some stuff?
what kind of stuff?
stuff?
um no they have the his dad is just
mean?
yeah.
le escribió.
quién le escribió a quién?
una carta al niño Rupert.
Rupert escribió una carta al niño.
y qué dice en la carta?
suena muy frustrado de que si tú vives en mi casa gratis tú no estás haciendo estas cosas limpiar su cuarto hacer esto hacer aquello.
entonces me dice.
mami yo no estoy aquí gratis.
yo trabajo.
y el dinero que se agarra en esta casa.
yo hago.
ya el niño sabe.
dice él.
yo hago más?
y traigo.
y mira como él me dice a mí que cómo es que vivo aquí en esta casa gratis?
después me dice.
porque tú tienes teléfono.
y entonces tú te lo pasas a en.
y me dice.
yo pago mi teléfono.
el niño.
entonces me dice.
mami es que yo trato de ser positivo.
y de no hacerle caso a mi papá.
pero él dice cosas que es you know que me frustran.
dice él.
y yo no sé qué decir.
y le digo.
no le digas nada papá.
tú tú eres menor de edad todavía.
ahora.
no no no.
y aunque sea mayor de edad él no puede decirle nada a su papá.
I know yo creo que él entiende esa parte.
pero es de esos de que él él se siente como que lo está.
he is letting him down his father.
he is letting his father down.
I think that's what frustrates him the most.
so when I tell him.
just just come and live with me.
the problem.
is like uh uh.
he says.
then my father is just gonna say I'm running away from my problem.
which is true what he is gonna say.
but.
oh well let him to decide.
the moment's gonna come anyway.
maybe he.
the moment is gonna come.
but it's gonna be ugly.
ah well.
el niño no va a querer hablar con padre.
él no va a querer saber del padre.
the problem that that's not the problem.
the problem is that the father is trying to do the same that he do when he was the baby's age.
no.
no Rupert never has wanted mucho así así tampoco.
no creo.
so a qué edad Rupert salió de la casa?
no sé.
Ru Rupert salió de la casa a las trece.
a los trece?
trece años.
ah no ya ya ya ya entonces ya más está atrasado ya.
Paco viene trabajando para su padre por desde que tenía trece.
ah bueno.
sí esa fue una de las primeras excusas que él usó cuando él mandó al niño a trabajar.
mmhm.
le digo.
no no no deja al niño en paz.
me dice.
no si yo trabajaba a los trece.
mira el muchacho que tan grande está.
ajá exactamente eso es lo que va a hacer el niño.
ay papi pero es que yo no quiero que él sea
y yo siempre se lo digo.
no es problema de que tú quieras o no quieras.
si Rupert se salió a su ca de su casa a los trece años.
y el niño tiene dieciséis.
y está en la casa todavía.
y arriba eso está haciéndole las carticas esas de de pronunciation.
I know.
I know.
I didn't like that but
pero si es normal.
para eso es que tenemos nosotros los hijos no?
malcriarlos y cuando sean grandes se cogen su camino.
no no no no.
Paco is a really responsible kid.
I mean considering.
exactamente exactamente.
he I mean I I'm not saying that he is right.
but you know he could be doing so many other stuff.
he could be besides failing because well he is failing in some of his classes.
he.
o ok let's think about a normal family.
no normal kid runs a company.
well let's just not call it a company.
no normal kid would be able to pick up a phone talk to another adult.
let him know what time the job is gonna happen.
call employees.
and tell them what time they need to be somewhere at fourteen at fifteen.
mmhm.
you know kids that the only thing they think about is when they're gonna get their new shoes.
no no no no no no kid.
yes kids.
look at look at me.
at what time I get off my house.
what do you mean?
a qué a qué edad yo salí de mi casa.
habla.
pues como a los veinte y no sé cuantos pues era viejísimo.
y tú te.
tú no trabajaste antes de eso?
a la escuela.
sí a la escuela no la escuela es la escuela.
la escuela no tiene nada que ver.
mmhm.
después de salir de la escuela que empecé a trabajar.
que tenía mujer.
y decía yo que yo era un hombre.
todavía yo estaba en mi casa.
y cuando me fajaba con mi mujer salía corriendo para mi casa.
yeah.
cuando venía de trabajar del campo.
veinticuatro por seis.
yo iba a la a casa de mi mujer.
ésa es la casa de mi mujer.
mi casa es la casa de mi mamá.
mi casa de mi mujer viviendo y todo allá.
sí sí aquí llegué.
mira aquí hay comida.
comida eso es lo que se lleva dentro.
en Cuba es comida.
en Cuba se lleva comida.
en Cuba no hay carros ni zapatos ni ropa ni nada.
comida comida comida comida comida.
voy a mi casa a llevar la otra parte de la comida.
que tú le llevabas comida a tu mamá.
aha.
como a mi mamá no le gusta la suciedad pues yo entonces traía los animales vivos.
ya.
y los mataba allá.
ah.
y llegaba a mi casa ya con la carne limpia.
con la carne limpiecita para tu mami.
claro.
tan lindo.
the purpose ah for this meeting today is for um to make ourselves independent from the county as far as the testing ah
qué están haciendo hoy?
ok ok.
yeah he was there.
um we'll actually he was trying to solve the problem with the.
yeah but what's the purpose for the meeting?
the purpose for the meeting is to.
not independence yet.
eventually.
is to find out todos los problemas que que pasan porque we we can't we can't get the um these the ah Excel sheet on one page you know.
we have to be doing little different things to get one report so we can send it downtown so they can you know send it to us.
I don't know if you guys know but from um they're gonna start giving us a C J Bat test at work.
at work?
yeah.
online?
the um the classroom is gonna be set up as a testing area.
oh wow.
and that's why?
and I'm sure you're gonna be involved with that.
and why is that?
um
we're not really.
yes you are.
money.
no?
they only helped us.
well but.
that had nothing to do with.
yeah but does he has to set up the software.
no.
no that's the system.
how about the ok saying is why is they gonna start giving out the tests?
ahí?
ah at the headquarters uhuh.
para tener control.
ok.
nosotros remember we want to give the test not waiting for them to to give the test.
a ver.
you know the scheduling?
it's gonna be three times in a week.
it's gonna be Monday Wednesday and Friday or something like that or?
mhmm.
or or morning time.
if it's in the afternoon then they do the orientation.
they're gonna do orientation.
y van a ahorrar dinero también haciendo eso?
not really.
ganan dinero?
nuhuh.
ahorrar.
uhuh.
ahora tienen que rentar uno.
no no.
I don't think so.
before you
van a gastar dinero.
he had.
oh ok.
más dinero porque ahora van a darle un P H Q a todo el mundo.
whether you apply or not
tú coges el examen antes de aplicar para que tú veas.
before you apply you take an exam.
and you get a P H Q.
yeah but that makes sense.
right.
no it doesn't.
taking the test first?
you don't think so?
you apply so you have a statistic of how many people applied.
but Mason in a way it's better because if you pass entonces you know you have the capabilities you know.
you gonna apply.
está bien.
pero why not how are you gonna find out the person who who applied and who didn't apply if they didn't pass the test they're out of the picture?
pero that's
well
es una persona que aplicó.
no.
entonces lo que vamos es que hacer es que cuando ellos vengan hacer el C J Bat.
uhuh.
tú vas a tener un log que ellos pueden poner su nombre.
y tú la preguntas ahí did you apply already on.
ok.
yes or no.
what are you gonna do about that?
then they have to go and apply.
go online.
right.
but the only problem I see is.
pero I don't know why are they doing that like that.
you should not give them a P H Q because si esa persona no pasa el test why give them a P H Q?
why give them a P H Q?
yeah but that's that's gonna cause a lot of problems.
if the people that you're having come in for the C J Bat have not applied in that's gonna delay more your procedure.
a ti no te entiendo.
cómo es posible?
why what but why is it gonna be done like that?
why not give them the orientation first.
that's what I said.
and then the C J Bat test in the afternoon if they're interested.
eso es lo que yo le dije.
todo no escuchamos todo.
I mean doesn't that make more sense right?
sí.
eh.
for them to have the orientation.
let them see what it's about.
see if they're interested.
but siempre se empieza.
and if they're not interested they don't come back in the afternoon for their C J Bat test.
exactly.
siempre se empieza por la orientación correcto no?
ah oye y anota ahí que esa fue idea mía.
oye
dime.
no esa idea fue tuya pero yo digo en principio estaba diciendo yo eso.
that was my idea!
I've been giving that.
y eso la la la idea de que que.
te acuerdas.
cuál?
and why they can't accept the Bat test.
oh right right.
están aceptando.
instituciones.
um like Community College and they only have the F Bat test taken.
they don't the C J Bat test and they accepting that.
and now they're accepting
but sin embargo if you have a F Bat taken I cannot accept your score.
but all these are state certified um.
they became state certified through the um the university.
but es es una cosa lógica si pasan ese examen the F Bat test si lo pasan why not y y y and the state accepts that one.
F D L E lo lo acepta.
volví entonces.
nosotros no lo podemos aceptar.
entonces dijo él que he came up with the idea.
esta pregunta se la hice yo a él y ahora viene con la idea de él.
bueno pues yo sinceramente pienso que deben de tener la orientación primero y después el examen.
yo también definitely.
definitivamente definitivamente.
ahí en la orientación tú puedes determinar si un candidato es bueno o no.
y esa persona cuando dice.
uh oh.
van a averiguar de las drogas que usé o
I'm not qualified.
I'm not qualified.
I'm gonna leave.
y no van a hacer nada más.
right?
exacto.
ya le van a dar el el P H Q pa que comiencen con el P H Q.
no no no no no.
entonces coger el examen entonces por la tarde
pero Mason but but you have to say that to him.
I'll say that to him.
that doesn't make sense.
eso no tiene sentido.
I did tell him that.
I don't agree with it.
yo yo estaba I don't agree with that.
because you're gonna spend more money on P H Qs giving it out to the people
van a gastar papel.
de por gusto.
it's gonna go in the garbage.
right.
and you're gonna get people that after they take the test are gonna say.
oh this isn't for me.
exacto.
pero eso es lo eso es lo que dije yo a él en en en la oficina mía se lo dije.
once they hear the orientation.
yo no estoy de acuerdo con eso.
no that doesn't make sense.
yo no creo que se le debe dar a nadie un P H Q a menos que aplique.
because yo tengo un papel te mando un papel a tu casa what are you gonna do with it?
das a los niños para que lo puedan coger porque if you're not interested why should I give you one?
three times and within the year.
and how much does.
and different versions.
listen.
that test how much does it cost us?
nine dollars.
a person.
ok so once again why would you have the person spend the mon you know why should we spend nine dollars for somebody that after you have the orientation might not even be interested in the position.
por eso te digo yo
, no hacen no tiene sentido.
lo que pasa es que yo quiero estar.
that's not cost effective.
numbered that's what they want.
tienen número nada más.
y para tener el número pues.
eh eso no tiene sentido.
no.
definitely it doesn't have no tiene no tiene sentido.
boy I I would have gotten into a good argument with him with that if I would have known that.
you're not gonna win it.
you're not gonna win it.
because yo se lo he explicado veinte mil veces a él.
y él no lo quiere entender lo que entra por aquí.
lo que le entra por aquí a él es.
y mira mira mira lo que
para que quieran aplicantes?
van a hacer van a hacer la academia hasta abril y hasta diciembre.
va a haber un.
va a haber un.
exacto.
y cuántas personas van a coger el academia?
cuarenta lo usual?
cuarenta.
what did you say Landon?
what are they gonna do?
freeze it.
ah nothing.
para diciembre.
budget.
mmm.
budget cuts.
oye things are bad.
things are bad.
uhhuh.
wow.
so you had the the the summer off.
oh my God.
yeah.
wow.
incredible.
oye hablando de te acuerdas que dije que que estaba hablando de Carle hablando de and opening the date?
that happened to me when I was about to graduate um we have that class they were not teaching the class doing that semesters.
lo que dicho.
lo que siempre se lo he dicho a él.
so that I had to wait because we didn't have enough people.
vamos a.
él él él dice que no y que no y que no.
but that makes sense I mean you know.
entonces ahora it makes sense because I told him.
it makes sense because we're the ones that deal with it.
and we know what you go through you know.
of course.
y él él decía.
que no que no y que no que no quiero hacer eso.
que no quiere hacer eso.
yo soy el lieutenant.
pero el día primero se lo dije.
even David se lo recomendó.
se lo recomendó a él de de cerrar la posición.
ah the larger the file the more time it's gonna take you to do everything that you have to do.
bueno y porque no lo hacen ahora?
why?
they're gonna do it now.
después que yo decirlo.
yeah they're gonna have a job opening for every month.
todos los meses los van a en vez de tener tres mil personas I'm gonna have at least um.
three hundred
five hundred four hundred something like that.
not that many.
I don't think you'll have that many.
five hundred people?
yeah it could be.
it could be.
by now I have two hundred.
I had two hundred this morning before I scheduled them two weeks period.
in a two week period.
pero I'm glad que lo aceptó.
porque yo estaba detrás del.
it's not just saying that you have three thousand.
like like right now I have three thousand nine hundred people applicants on a list than having five hundred only that you can scroll down and and and choose from that.
why?
so that's why that's why I thought it um it was better for us.
well actually it was better for me because I'm the one who works with the program.
y tú no ves como un cambio o que viene así como de muy lejos.
un cambio?
tú no tú no oíste lo que dijo?
tú no ves como que va a haber un cambio de algo?
bueno.
te voy a decir.
ay yo no sé.
qué tipo de cambio?
para ahora ahora cuando estuv estuviste con yo lo dije a él it means a promotion.
ok.
because I'm gonna be doing.
you know why because you know why because I was told to teach Daniela everything I do.
I'm gonna I'm gonna be doing testing.
I'm trying to put two and two
right.
oh no no.
together.
the forget it.
that's not the way it works.
the counting doesn't work that way.
tú no sabes que lo que van a hacer.
no van a hacer nada.
mira.
acuerda una cosa.
yo llevo aquí va para diez años.
y en los diez años a él que le prometieron que iban a sacar a la gente the personal technician todo technician iban payroll a trabajar aprenderse el trabajo.
lo hicieron.
hacen crosstrai hacen crosstraining.
nunca lo hicieron.
nunca lo hicieron el crosstraining.
sí pero fíjate que a ti todavía no te han puesto el assistant ahí a trabajar.
and they are not gonna put it.
no hay dinero.
me dieron cuatro cuatro sargentos ahí cuanto le cuesta eso a nosotros?
el budget de nosotros para bajo.
estos cuatro sargentos se iban con a hundred thousand dollars.
ah no.
es mucho más que eso.
over that.
yo diría.
ellos solo.
tú no crees.
cuatro o cinco?
cuatro.
cuatro.
porque
I don't know either.
ahí.
más gente nada más de dos cientos cincuenta mil dólares.
no.
están haciendo recruiting solamente.
where?
where are they doing?
they go into the university a la a la ciudad y eso.
minimum cincuenta mil por persona.
but they they set up meetings.
verdad?
they set up like sign ins and stuff.
I don't know.
llevan.
do you see it?
do you guys see a list?
I don't see nothing.
I don't see nothing.
so what is it they take when they go to these recruitings?
supuestamente ellos van a la universidad.
and they put up a little table there.
and then they signing up people.
well you know and they.
so who gets that list of people signing up or whatever?
we don't see no list.
if they go on the.
so how do so ho who is seeing that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing?
ah eso es lo que te digo yo que aquí hacen lo que le dan la gana y ven lo que ellos ven y nada más.
porque ahora mismo es no no es razón para tener cinco cuatro de esos sargentos en el departamento de nosotros.
sentados ahí.
sentándose no nada.
looking beautiful.
sí.
sí casual.
mira.
es más y yo digo no están tan y tan preparados esta gente.
ayer tuvimos este un grupo no sé si fueron a un training bureau los alemanes.
pues ellos fueron para ayer a nosotros there were about twenty people there.
tú me crees que ninguno es oficial ni María ni ni la otra nueva ni la morena este tampoco.
ninguno.
sabían qué hacer para poder presentarse ese give an introduction.
yo tuve que meterme para decirle a ellos más o menos lo que se hacía en este departamento cómo se procesan el aplicante cómo esperar que es lo que se esperan in the academy.
and who were these people?
Germany.

you gave them copies?
wow que interesante.
we didn't give copies of.
oh well that's right.
I remember when last year they came from Spain or something.
que había unos españoles que habían venido.
the.
sí.
I remember.
pero fíjate.
entonces la um la morena empezó a hablar ahí.
uno de los de los alemanes le preguntó que si tenía que para poder hacer policía.
he said.
no you have to be certified.
no entendía la pregunta.
oh my God.
le le decía
meatlover yeah.
meatlover over here.
that's you right?
ay sabe bueno.
oh that looks good.
wow.
tremendo plato grande.
acá.
oye eso sabe rico.
tú te vas a comer todo eso?
tú puedes con todo eso?
es algo de Lana.
lo de Lana parece yo no sé qué cosa es.
my God.
una frazada en vuelta ahí.
eso da unas cinco personas Lana.
sí.
but what is that actually?
qué cosa es eso por afuera?
un taco.
es una tortilla gigante en vuelta.
pero es un taco?
un tamal gigante.
la verdad es que no sé que es.
thank you.
ah tú tenías el lunch that dinner the other day.
buen provecho.
ay thank you.
no vamos a salir de aquí con olor a comida.
I'm gonna smell like a fried ah chicken.
y está que arde sabes.
positive?
no.
worse.
it's been worse.
we had more applicants before than now.
right.
some of them don't even have email so they they don't have a computer so they have to go to the library or friends house.
some people have to do an application three times before they can get it correctly.
uhhuh.
before it can go through the whole screening and downtown screens them and everything sometimes three times they have to do it.
wow.
yeah yeah.
thank you.
coger una cosita de
y cuál tú crees que la mayoría de.
no but listen listen Mason.
el mayor sistema bueno
es muy lento.
el primero que no funciona correctamente como deber funcionar.
ok.
se demora mucho tiempo para un aplicante poder terminar una aplicación y sentirse de ello como I did something you know.
I'm expecting you know a response right away.
you know and and the way it's going now is
the application is going in too slow.
, is running running too slow.
you know what was funny here in this meeting?
there's this man sitting next to me from E T S C.
he's like very intelligent you know.
and um he he gives us this whole presentation in paper with diagrams and with ah pictures and
I I mean like nice presentation.
well the lieutenant took over the presentation from the beginning to the end like if he had done the presentation.
it was incredible.
the guy didn't say almost I mean I think that if he said four words
but that's what I'm telling you.
that's the problem with the lieutenant.
he does not let you speak and put your your your senses into the into a meeting.
yeah but
esto esto lo hizo el el programmer este emm
yeah yeah and he spent like maybe months doing this.
that's what.
and the rest of the stuff.
he put it all in writing for us and everything.
y qué pasa que entonces en vez de él aplicarle esto el lieutenant took it upon himself.
and and
yes.
he knew what he was talking about.
yeah he did.
but the guy had more to say about
, because he's the one who who prepared.
and he has also other another form that he he actually a presentation
otro.
con más más y más este información.
verdad.
that we never went through the whole thing.
we just skipped pages and skipped pages you know.
we were laughing about it now in the car.
le dije.
teniente no dejaste a este pobre hombre hablar.
qué dijo él?
no le va a hablar.
dice.
ay es verdad que it was noticeable.
él dijo.
yes.
no but you know what got me?
that he wasn't aware of all the problems that you were going through.
right.
everything that you were doing he had no idea.
but see that's the problem lack of communication.
si él me ellos me llegaron a mí a decirme o sea decirle a
the lieutenant dice.
no Mason is the one that works with this.
let's take them downtown and show them what he needs and how he does this so they can understand what's our problem.
but he takes advice todos los meetings.
iba
o sea they're never gonna know.
right.
but you know I think that the bottom line is that because we're just one department that's having this problem the county is not gonna change the whole frigging system for us.
you know what I'm saying?
no way.
oh did I say a bad word?
no pero
I mean really?
that's how they look at it.
they're not gonna change the system for us.
well because of the type of position that it is ok you have to keep um tracking it for everything.
mhmm.
sí porque te acuerdas de the county the county um emplea y hay una posición para secretary right.
no tiene que estar tracking cosas.
for example.
mi comida es picante.
drink water drink water.
esperate que yo un pimiento.
oh my God what color was it?
it was green like a pepper.
uh oh.
jalapeño no?
anyhow the um so they hired one position for
and there's they say ah maybe a hundred people apply for the position of secretary.
so they screened the hundred.
and whoever qualifies for it they will pick out and interview them.
in our case no.
if you have a position that continues a position like police officer everybody applies to it.
and everybody has to rescreen.
and everybody's scheduled to take a test.
so that's the difference.
and that's not the only test that police officers take.
they do the polygraph.
the they do the the what the medical stuff.
what's the other thing that they do?
psychological.
no el assessment.
assessment's gonna be taken away now.
really?
yeah.
you mean they're not gonna do it at all?
or somebody else is gonna do it?
they're not gonna do it.
because since they gonna do it in the academy why have them do it twice.
oh like part of the training or something.
right.
do they get support for that now when they do it?
so this is better for them then.
mhmm.
right.
yeah.
well if you if you look at it it's more like um maybe more like you think about it.
how will you handle this?
you know will you ignore this person?
they're testing your skills.
or will you.
no.
how about attitude?
will you you assume?
I think they're testing for common sense or your common sense.
they're testing your skills.
yeah your skills yeah.
you know how would you react to different situations you know.
in front of a situation.
yeah.
do people actually fail that?
of course.
they do?
yeah.
the assessment not a lot.
but you have some you know a percentage that that do fail.
I think they should definitely also implement the fact that they should be able to see their C J Bat scores.
or maybe automatically when they finish with the C J Bat test an email gets sent to them saying.
you got a seventy.
you got a whatever.
now ah well not not now.
now no.
not with the police officer position.
with police complaint officer and police dispatcher they do.
you can actually go into um Miami day dot gov and to the testing site.
and it'll tell you pass or fail.
it's not gonna tell you your score though.
but that's because.
coge ese picante también.
the county is the one that sets up those appointments.
es bastante picante.
that's why ours don't they can't be seen.
un pique.
pero es así de grande.
y me lo comí completito.
ay ya pero
oh my God.
después me dio hiccup.
se me se me miraron los ojos.
un demasiado.
hay que hacerle eso pregúntala de a la mamá una vez hizo los jueyes te acuerdas.

cogimos de eso mucho.

entonces ella estaba preparándolo.
y yo no sé que estaba haciendo alguna computadora.
que ella me dice.

y me dio
va a probar uno.
muchacha le vació el bote de sal.
y cuando yo me metí a la boca los ojos me hicieron así.
había mucha sal.
miren vació el bote de sal en en un cangrejo.
ah yo estaba.
mira se me pusieron los ojos blancos.
el salmorejo se hace con sal pimienta y ajo machacado y un poquito de aceite.
un poquito un poquito.
y lo mezclas con la carne del cangrejo.
y lo pones en el caparazón todo lo mezclado.
coges guineitos sancochados.
y te lo comes con el guineito.
una mezcla ahí extraña.
pero parece que le echó demasiado.
imagínate.
muchacha.
lo quería matar ustedes de verdad.
después dicen eso y quieren más no way.
por poco te mata.
por poquito.
pero es algo que voy a probar algún día porque es algo diferente.
no mucha gente sabe lo que es eso qué es ese plato.
mhmm.
but you take it out of the shell?
no you eat it in the shell.
you know you just with a fork you know you take it out.
pero de sacar la y todo eso.
pero para la parte más grande del cangrejo se lo sacamos.
but you have to open it from the bottom.
mhmm.
ay pero mira yo me he reído tanto.
la ha pasado más bien en el carro con el teniente ese.
porque yo no estaba enterada de que el sargento esto para él es una nueva experiencia.
él nota.
siempre con una.
exacto.
y entonces el loco ha sido administración.
nunca ha hecho eso.
so él está como como
what's the word that I wanna use?
Florentino?

lo tenía.
y el teniente dando instrucciones.
para acá para allá dobla aquí.
vete para allá.
el qué sé yo.
él haciendo el caso todo lo que decía el teniente.
digo y yo creo que no tiene opción de no pre no prestar atención a lo que está diciendo.
pero oíste lo que dijo él de que no se si es porque por rango le estoy haciendo caso?
porque?
that's why I said I don't think you have an option.
entonces después tiene que park.
y entonces nos empezamos a fastidiar.
dice.
ya me están poniendo nervioso.
no voy a poder parquear.
dejó el carro three feet away from the curb.
caminar.
estaba aquí three feet away.
sí sí.
ella nos iba a invitar a almorzar.
pero como sabemos que hoy íbamos a hacer eso.
ha ido con él vaya.
después estar se se puso decirle
, que el el graphic que él hizo supuestamente para el teniente.
él pregunta.
is it good enough like this o algo así?
como que lo puso por el piso.
pero es que yo que lo que el teniente estaba diciendo.
y sé que tú estás pensando.
yo que leí que el teniente de verdad que él le había hecho de verdad un graph de eso a él.
but he did do one.
but not as nice as this.
entiendes we say he did it with crayons.
and then I said.

he's moving with his they're moving from from the house there right.
and right now.
porque it's a lot cheaper.
it's like almost fifty dollars cheaper.
but they sold their house verdad?
in rent.
they sold their house.
ok.
but the thing is
that es su tío that has lived with him like I don't know how like ya several years
he doesn't pay anything.
él no paga nada en la casa.
like he doesn't like even water.
and he he lives there with his
el machismo!
he lives there with his wife and his daughter.
and I understand see you know if you don't have enough money at least algo you know.
yeah.
but nothing.
so his mom's like.

I.
it's his wife and everybody?
not just
yeah you know.
and she's retired the.
qué.
her gran she she's responsible for the you know her mom.
and her her older daughter.
pero ella es ella es enfermita.

so Fernando's like fed up with it.
well the thing is that they started looking for a new house to move in.

uhhuh and his nieces.
and the grandmother?
if she wants to go with them.
because she was taking.
but the si but the sister the one that was married and lives somewhere else right.
yeah she lives somewhere else.
ok.
but the grandmother was taking you know her son's side.
but the thing is that yeah.
como siempre como siempre.
I don't know yeah.
it's so annoying.
los hombres.
it's a little machista.
Nick and his mom que todo era como hombre.
yeah.
she tell me like they favour them so much.
yeah I don't know if it's like this hispanic thing.
how annoying.
that the men are
yeah.
no matter what the
with my mom and my uncle you know my mom says that she's like you know she's always favoured my uncle.
my grandma was the same way with my brother.
like even to this day even to this day she'll give like you know money for to pay the rent y todo.
like if because he goes to work.
and he's like.
bueno yo no quiero ir.
so he'll call in sick.
so to make up the difference my grandmother will give it to him.
that's low.
qué jodían it's like stupid Nicaraguans!
it's not it's it's it's in general.
I don't agree that's all yeah.
I think it's like all.
I mean I understand helping your kid if they're in a crisis situation.
yeah but
, pero darle lo que quieres dar
wow well the thing is that they found this place right.
but the house comes with a little efficiency.
outside.
oh ok.
within the the.
you know within the area?
and so Fernando's like.
well just tell my uncle that he wants to go live with us that he can rent the apartment out.
rent rent ok.
don't don't yeah don't let him know that the that it comes with the house.
bueno.
so they're they're like.
well if you wanna move in next to us it's cheap it's fifty dollars.
and you're not gonna get cheaper than that anywhere.
mmhm.
so he's gonna pay for the fifty dollars his water his light.
he thinks that he's just helping out.
yeah.
don't wanna know.
it's you know but that was the only way
to make him you know.
but why do they have to live with him?
why can't he live with his wife and kids in another place?
because apparently he can't afford living on his own.
the grandmother wants the
uh I know the situation's difficult y todo but
pero he he works?
a lot of um yeah.
and his wife works también?
yes.
and somehow Fernando's.
how many kids do they have?
one kid?
one little girl.
and they can't afford rent or anything?

I told Michael I'm like.
I think I'm going to do it.
well you pay nine dollars for the first three months.

and then the thing is that I went.
and they told me that I didn't.
I had to get a new passport.
so I'm like.
oh my god.

why wha how old how old were you when you took your last picture?
because it doesn't eso no importa.
oh.
the thing is that my passport ellos me lo han revalidado dos veces.
and now it's a law you know in the Nicaraguan consul whatever.
que si ya te lo han revalidado dos veces you have to get a new passport.
even if I have like you know sheets available.
that's so stupid.
there are pages available whatever.
when you get your U S passport are you gonna keep your Nicaraguan passport too?
I I I don't know.
with a U S passport you don't have to do that.
no I think my parents don't have it any more.
I think Sarah does.
yeah.
I don't know why.
but Sarah wasn't born there.
but she has a Nicaraguan.
when she lived over there I think that's when she got it.

all the designers I need to clear things up.
and I'm like.
Raquel's the name of the boss?
yeah.
la pesada.
yeah.
ok.
our supervisor is Ana.
and honestly.
Ana's her cousin?
no Ana's just a girl she's always worked with.
but.
but she's not above her.
no she's below her.
she's just above us.
ok.
pero she has like una mala fama.
to me she's always been nice but she's.
who Ana?
yeah.
oh ok.
and you know they they told me several people que han echado gente por ella stuff like that.
oh really?
well then the thing is Raquel wanted to confront everybody.
and clear everything out.
and and tell Ana that that wasn't true.
la cosa es que
she had me on phone conference.
and she practically told Ana that no that everything that she said she was telling her and right she wasn't referring to us.
whatever.
and I the thing is that I get to the office and Ana's like  almost crying.
she's like.
that's not true.
yo no la yo no la desmentí porque what's my word against hers.
yeah.
but she's like.
believe me.
that's what she says.
I'm not lying.
so I don't know who's lying you know.
parásita.
and so they both have a reputation of
yeah both of them!
so it's like Lauren I don't know who to trust.
some people are good actors too.
oh yeah.
and oh and then Raquel she blamed it on Elisa.
Elisa left the office.
she got transferred to New York.
so you know she she kind of found ok well let me blame it on Elisa because she's not in the office.
but if this.
to defend herself.
yeah but and not to you know para no echar a adelante you know.
but in the end if this if this problem gets bigger
uhhuh.
and Ana says.
well Elisa was the one gossiping you know.
and she does Elisa's like she doesn't know what's going on.
it's a mess.
and I'm just like tired of it.
what was it what was it they were blaming on were blaming on her?
that she she was the one that told Raquel that what Ana was saying to us.
that's how Raquel found out that you know Ana was telling
oh.
yeah.
, telling us that she wasn't she wasn't happy with our work.
well  well if she's not happy with the work fine you know.
she could I mean you can understand that you know.
everybody has their own level of expectations.
but.
but why don't you think just sit down and be like.
look you guys I would prefer if you guys.
and she's telling us she never said that.
o sea I don't know who is lying.
and honestly I'm tired of it.
and I don't care you know?
ya me tienen cansada.
no thank you.
thank you.
yes.
me tienen cansada.
you know in situations like that the truth always comes out.
always.
sooner or later somebody will slip.
mmhm.
how annoying.
that's is like high school.
yeah.
mmm.
but they're not complaining about you are they?
I get along with everybody.
mmhm.
but I just hate being
yeah all the second guessing back and forth thing.
and it's distracting.
yeah.
they gave me two tickets to the movies.
oh really?
for my birthday.
who at work?
that's cool.
for my birthday.
hmm?
oh it's Michael.
ah.
hello?
hi.
thank you.
I'm here at Denny's with my cousin.
because we're eating breakfast.
or lunch!
you don't seem to.
I told you I told you yesterday I was gonna go and do this remember.
I was gonna do the whole um recording thing for María's friend.
yes.
mi entonces ahora you wanna speak Spanish!
oh.
very cute.
I told you I was gonna eat at Denny's with Chloe.
but that's it I'm not.
no no more sweets.
that that's the end of it I promise.
no sweets today no sweets
tomorrow I promise.
I gotta talk to you about my puppy.
she has her her lungs are swollen.
and they put her on antibiotics for two weeks.
two pills a day.
and I have to give her fifteen drops of some fluid thing.
he doesn't he.
I told him what happened.
he he started making a noise.
I'm like.
yes that is exactly it.
and so then he did an x ray out of her lungs.
and he asked me he's like.
has she been in has she been in an accident or something?
I'm like no.
he's like.
has she you know gone into the pool?
I guess asking me if she's swallowed water or something.
I'm like no I'm like.
she hates the water.
I mean god even when I bathe her you know it's like no.
so I don't know if maybe it's from before that she's had it.
and she's accumulating sitting there.
I mean I don't know.
maybe one day when I took her to the beach.
she might have swallowed some water accidentally.
I mean I don't know where it came from.
so he told me to
huh?
no no no no I'm like.
it's curable?
it's treatable?
he's like.
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.
he's like.
it's just that her
he he showed me the x ray.
it's like a part of her lung.
it's so fascinating.
like I would I would want to be a vet except I don't like biology.
oh and they had to put a little cat to sleep today.
I'll tell you about that later.
this is so sad.
oy.
uhuh this is why I couldn't be a vet.
anyways um.
no he showed me a part of her lungs that that in the x ray they came out black.
like they were just very dark because they were swollen.
and he's like.
you see it's like they shouldn't be that dark.
they should be more like this.
and he compared it to like a lighter gray area in her lung.
so he's like.
well we'll put her on antibiotics.
and then come back in two weeks.
so
he's like well he's like he's not sure he's like he's like you know.
put try take the biotics cause her lungs are swollen.
I I guess her lungs are swollen and making her cough.
and so then
what her lungs being swollen?
I don't know.
I didn't ask him.
he's not sure what it is.
he told me to to give her the medication.
and then see if it happens in two weeks.
and then if it continues in two weeks then he'll he'll see what else it you know what else it could be.
so
he gave her a shot today so I'm not going to give her any medication until tomorrow.
so she's in my room right now.
she's sleeping because she's drowsy and stuff.
and he cleaned her glands.
and then I told him about the about the flea thing.
he gave me some pills for the fleas.
um it's a pill.
you give her one pill every ten days and it kills the fleas within thirty minutes of her taking the pills.
so I gave her the pill right when I got home.
and he just told me just to you know not to bathe her now.
but um to you know just clean the house or whatever like you know.
the usual.
he he told me you've got nothing to worry about obviously.
so other than that she's ok.
I I don't know.
I didn't ask him I didn't ask him.
um he knew what it was.
he knew what medication to give her.
so I'm sure he must be familiar with what whatever it is.
he's just asked me where it came from.
and I told him I didn't know so
because I didn't know I guess he couldn't really
he couldn't assume where it came from so.
the coughing.
yeah he's like.
it's probably because her lungs are swollen.
he told me.
so he's like
I didn't tell him about the sneezing.
the sneezing I really think is because she hits her nose.
I mean when I hit my nose I sneeze.
so uh she's always launching herself into the carpet.
and hitting herself with a paw.
and I just think it has to do with that.
but I'll mention it.
if it continues like severely then I I'll tell him in two weeks when I see him.
he took her temperature.
she has um she had a hundred and two of um temperature.
her normal temperature is is one oh one.
so it was a little bit high.
so
but he said it wasn't a fever or anything.
and she gained like two pounds.
so
ok what are we gonna do?
um four maybe?
ok.
ok bye.
what are you going to do afterwards?
I dunno.
I have to well I need to I have to finish a a drawing for my parents.
and so yesterday Michael and I.
he started telling me like.
he sketched over what I need to put in the drawings.
so but I need him to help me draw detail.
because the wall's being constructed.
uhhuh.
like I know like the foundations and the footings.
but I don't know the actual construction.
and what what the materials are called.
and how to technically put them in the drawings.
so he does obviously.
mmhm.
so I have to sit with him and do it.
my parents are like asking me and bothering me about it.
I'm like
I understand.
but it's like.
look like I have things to do.
you know last weekend like I had to take work home for my boss.
yeah.
my boss.
so it's like I I don't don't assume that I have every weekend all the time to do it you know.
then I have that exam to study for.
so ugh.
I wanted to go to um
what are we going to do afterwards?
nothing I have
I wanted to go to Old Navy.
well I have to go to Old Navy to get um Carolina and Carolina's daughter something
mmhm.
for tomorrow so
I figure I'll find something there in the sale.
because I just spent a hundred and forty dollars on the vet.
so I have no money.
uhhuh.
later I have to go with Sarah to  to buy something for somebody's one of our friend's birthdays that's tonight.
and
you're going to a party?
yeah it's in a house.
like a get together.
um and I have work to do.
for work?
because yesterday oh with the whole passport thing uhhuh I had to do uh the ladies like in the morning.
she told me she's like.
you have to do this today.
alright.
so I'm like.
oh I told my coworkers and Raquel.
I'm like.
I I'm not feeling well.
I have to go home whatever.
so I'm like.
I'll take work home.
I didn't tell them that.
yeah.
so on Monday I won't be behind.
do they pay you more for taking work home or no?
no.
and I don't tell them what I do.
because
yeah.
se la hace costumbre.
yeah.
um.
and they'll expect me to do it every weekend or something.
yeah.
and I think she's kinda noticing that all of us are just fed up with the whole situation.
who the lady Raquel?
mmhm.
and that we're sick of it.
there's so much drama.
you don't need much contact with all this stress and deadlines.
we don't need it.
you don't need additional
no.
stress.
I mean the job's stressful enough.
I don't need to add to it.
and that's what she does.
so I get really we fell down on like review like two weeks ago.
I guess she's asking for our bonuses.
they don't do that thing where you can review her?
I think we do.
I don't know when they're gonna you know cuando nos yeah.
it could be anonymous.
no and it's not anonymous.
well she's a bitch.
and she's bipolar.
did the guy leave that guy that she was
no he's still there!
I thought he was leaving to New York you said or something.
they haven't mentioned it again.
I don't know.
sometimes I think that it would be best.
but sometimes I think it wouldn't.
because when he's around she's like you know
in a better mood?
yeah she doesn't bother us.
she's not like on our back every five minutes.
is it done yet is it done yet?
that's annoying.
it's in there's a when they thank god it wasn't me.
we went we we had our morning meeting whatever.
we went to the office Mari.
and Maricarmen had to do you know.
she had an assignment that day.
and no habían pasado diez minutos.
and she calls.
and she's like.
ya ya les puedo ver?
Maricarmen was like.
acabo de comenzar.
they don't know what it's like to do the work.
that's why they ask so much and they
like it happens to me sometimes at work it's like.
you know they give me something.
they don't even.
sometimes they don't understand that it's a lot of coordinating and a lot of you know flipping back and forth.
and they're like.
oh can you have it by tomorrow?
and I'm like.
no!
you know I can try.
but I'm not I gonna lie to you and tell you that it's possible.
mmhm.
because well there's just me alone.
and it's because they maybe once did it.
or now they forgot you know that it takes so long how time consuming it is.
or it turns out they've never done it so
Leticia told her one day.
one day you should just sit with one of us.
and you know sit down.
and actually take your time.
and see how long it takes to draw something.
that's the only problem with my boss.
she's
the people that actually the parties that I work with the school parties my team
mmhm.
they're really good.
because like I had to do something for like the bathrooms right.
mmhm.
and I had to select tiles.
and yes it sounds very easy.
but it's a lot of time consuming.
because
yeah.
it's very time consuming because they give you a board with different price ranges.
there's group one two three and four and five.
five being the most expensive.
mmhm.
and then in in the specs like which which is part of your contract you tell them you know.
price group one and two are the cheapest.
you're gonna use maybe fifty five percent thirty five percent of that.
and then the most expensive one group four you use five percent.
so I have to make sure that what I'm using has been assigned to the bathroom in that percentage.
you know how long?
I mean it takes a lot.
and then in addition to that.
yeah.
I have to coordinate that with flooring and you know the other interior finishes.
I mean there's a lot of work.
and I started sketching and this and that.
so when I told my boss I'm like.
I'm sorry look I know it's taking a long time it's like I'm just you know lollygagging.
but she said.
no no.
she's like.
I'm not questioning your you know just whatever.
but I wanna get them right once.
because thank god when we submitted the drawings we didn't ask like the tile yet.
mmhm.
what we gave them in the spec what we were gonna price out in the contractor didn't didn't bid it out didn't price it.
so the so now when we're submitting these new drawings the drawi the the work is coming out more expensive now.
but it wasn't our fault.
it was that he
mmhm.
he didn't bid it correctly.
so he comes he comes to the the contractor comes to us and he's like.
oh you know you guys use this and that.
and I'm like.
no!
and I stopped him right then and there and I printed out all the drawings and I'm like.
I know what I did.
I worked on this for a month and a half.
you know I know I I mean I
yeah.
memorized the color line and the numbers and everything I it's you know.
and at the end we were right.
so I'm like.
I'm glad that I took so much time to do that.
because now at the end it avoids error.
do they expect us
I mean no I mean we pulled it off I don't know how.
did you think like projects en un día?
Lauren.
and then
but I told her I'm like.
te quieren tener como los chinos eh?
yeah we're we're like a little sweatshop!
the other day the A C was messed up.
it's messed up.
and I dunno when they're gonna fix it.
are your in your building?
in our office.
all right.
we were like.
todos estamos con un calor and working.
and we had that.
and we're like.
are I'm sure this is like como unos chinitos ahí trabaja.
it's crazy.
we were watching something about that.
on Dateline last Friday.
um.
you don't watch that.
about China?
no Taiwan.
Nike
uhhuh.
for an eighty five dollar pair of shoes that they have they pay one factory twenty dollars.
yeah.
one factory.
and within that they divide it within the employees.
the most an employee who works there makes there is two dollars.
yeah.
eso eso eso es un pegado.
I was like how much?
O B I met when I went to was it no it was in China.

and one of the guys told us that a week they make five dollars.

you remember my dad's neighbors my dad my dad's old neighborhood?
the people that lived
there was a some Puerto Rican coup couple that lived here.
there were unos chinos que vivían aquí.

the father did that.
he did it he was in the tennis shoes business.
mmhm.
and he used to come in with all these shoes.
and he used to be like.

uhhuh.
and he used to wear them.
and it's the same thing in my eyes.
yeah.
and he used to get my dad like tennis shoes y todo to play tennis.
uhhuh.
it's like it's the same thing.
he's like.
la única cosa es que no te pagan.
no tienes que pagar mucho porque no you don't have the check.
no.
you know the Nike check on it.
you know what I did learn?
um.
they well other than I guess they have tests and stuff.
pero to test um if like jewelry has like lead and stuff.
mmhm.
they bang it against you know the floor or a surface.
a surface uhhuh.
and depending on el el el sonido.
uhhuh.
tiene lead or no.
and we were testing some things that we had bought from Chico's.
it was like forty five dollar you know um bracelets and stuff like that.
and all of them had lead.
had lead?
how can you tell the difference.
like you compare two sounds?
or you you automatically know.
yeah.
like get get a get one of your rings or something that's like gold or something or stainless steel.
like like costume jewelry?
something like that and just go like that.
mmhm.
and get something you've bought.
and you you know something you wanna see if it has lead.
and it usually has like a heavier um pounding sound.
and the other sound is very light.
so the lead is the heavier one obviously.
mmhm.
and we tested it and.
Maricarmen is like.
let me see!
and she has like very nice ring.
the different types of gold
Maricarmen the lady we saw the other day in the park?
no that's Juana.
oh oh yeah.
um and she starts like banging it.
uh and it's a very light sound.
and then we got one of the accessories that we had bought.
and we she the same thing.
and you could hear.
like it's heav it's heavy sound.
why do they use lead?
because it's a cheaper material?
anyway it's more
what do they use in of that?
my god that's bad.
you can you can
yeah.
ahí mismo.
people I know some people that can't.
that are allergic?
I remember había uno hindú or something that came to.
uhhuh.
and I was gonna give the girl it was a plastic pen to sign it.
and she couldn't touch the plastic.
why?
she said that her whole skin breaks out in allergies.
with plastic?
yeah so she she had to hold like the plastic had a little you know the little rubber part?
uhhuh.
she had to hold it like that.
it was really weird.
oh.
she can't touch any kind of plastic.
well I know a girl who can't go into the ocean.
she breaks out.
I guess the salt water that's what she said you know.
that's weird.
you know we were we were in the beach.
and one of the guys didn't believe her.
and threw her in the water.
he did?
and then you know
lo hubiera matado pobrecita.
we all realised that he wasn't lying.
what a jerk!
oh and who else?
my friend Sel Selina.
she's married.
and she's allergic to  latex?
uhhuh.
yeah I know people who are allergic to that.
you could be allergic to anything.
Paige is allergic to nickel.
she can't wear
no?
all her silver and gold jewelry and everything she gave it to me.
she has to she can only wear.
no wait I'm sorry I think she can wear white gold.
she can't wear silver at all.
I know that for sure.
not even her necklaces or anything.
I'm like my god.
nothing.
I don't know if she's still like that.
but she was like that for a few years.
so I I don't know.
I know some allergies you can take like shots of medication.
you're going to Old Navy right now?
you're gonna come with me?
yeah.
I was gonna go there and The Gap.
well first Old Navy because it's cheaper.
ok.

I'm like.
what size is Carolina?
like I dunno.
she said just get a gift card.
no because it's a gift card I have to put like money into it you know.
significant money!
oh!
ok.
y después volviste para acá.
y después me volví porque no me gustó.
o sea super chévere la rumba.
claro.
super rico la salida los amigos.
sí sí sí.
la universidad todo muy rico
pero como que no es lo mismo porque yo acostumbrada a toda mi vida aquí siempre.
claro claro.
estar uh en Colombia.
y yo creo que le pasa a la gente
depender cien por ciento de mi papá o sea porque.
oh claro.
quiero tal cosa papi.
quiero comprarme un desodorante papi.
necesito un desodorante.
necesito un tampon papi.
claro.
necesito un tampon.
claro y esto yo estaba allí.
me entiendes.
y yo con veinte años diciéndole a mi papá que nece necesito que me dé cinco mil pesos para ir a comprarme una caja de de de tampons pues
bastante
claro.
y la salida las rumbias yo soy mucho de salir a comer a un restaurante rico.
claro.
de conocer lugares entonces
eso es claro porque.
eso fue un cambio para mí que no.
claro.
a mí me gustó o sea no en general no
lógico.
es que yo pensé que en cualqui si cualquiera si fuese al revés una persona que ve toda la vida en Colombia se viene.
a lo mejor le cuesta irse.
no me voy otra vez.
sí no no no no.
y depende de dónde ha vivido también.
entonces ya me volví para acá.
y lógicamente como al principio cuando yo me iba a volver era sola.
y toda mi familia se quedaba allá.
mmhm.
que me dio super duro.
porque tenía que vivir en la casa de un tío.
claro.
y bueno ya ya me puse a trabajar.
y fue cuando entré a trabajar al consultorio odontológico.
ok.
siempre me gustaba mucho la odontología.
siempre estaba muy involucrada en la odontología.
sí.
y empecé a trabajar.
pero era trabajo de doce horas diarias.
wow.
no era poquito.
era todo el día.
y entonces en diciembre mis papás vinieron con toda mi familia.
sí.
de vacaciones.
y estuvimos esquiando en New Hampshire porque.
oh qué rico.
my dad had one of those um townshares.
ok.
that um you know we go every year.
ok.
we've always gone every year so
oh wow.
y cómo es?
y y no el nos fuimos a esquiar.
super rico estar una quince días estuvimos esquiando.
wow.
uh yo pues lógicamente pedí yo vacaciones lo que sea.
ok.
cuando ya era tiempo de vol volver a trabajar y ellos volver al colegio y eso mi mamá dijo que no.
y se quedaron aquí.
ay qué bueno.
entonces mi papá compró casa y bueno en fin.
y les gusta acá?
y es que nosotros hemos vivido aquí toda la vida.
claro.
ah tus papás también.
lo que pasa es que mi papá vive enamorado de Colombia.
ése es su país y él creció en Colombia realmente.
de que parte de Colombia?
de Medellín.
de Medellín.
mis papás son de Medellín.
entonces él realmente creció en Colombia él.
mmhm.
para él Colombia es lo máximo.
muy lógico.
exacto.
como para mí Estados Unidos.
exacto lógico.
o sea para mí ésta mi vida ha sido acá.
lógico.
no igual mi mamá siempre dice.
en lo que yo no pueda ir no voy.
o sea mi papá dice que él es lo que es por Estados Unidos.
y que tiene lo que tiene por Estados Unidos.
claro.
porque es un país de oportunidades.
sí.
blah.
pero que Colombia es Colombia.
sí sí sí.
y su país es Colombia o sea
él no deja de ser colombiano por nada en el mundo.
no a mí también yo bueno yo viví que veinte bueno veintiún años.
veinte veintiún años en Venezuela.
en Venezuela o sea tú eres venezolana cien por cien.
sí nací allí y todo entonces nunca salí.
uh papá se vino.
o sea siempre he vivido allí.
papá se vino de Colombia él tenía.
que by the way se vino ilegal.
y mamá también cuando se vinieron ellos se vinieron.
wow.
fue por por eso es que yo nací en Los Angeles.
que él decía.
oh.
, cuando te estaba diciendo ahorita oh no yo estaba a a
I've I've never heard of you know Colombians in L A.
es porque realmente no
oh.
claro no es lo usual.
no exacto.
mis papás se vinieron por el hueco por o sea Méjico.
etcétera.
wow o sea toda la aventura ésa wow.
o sea Colombia Centro América Méjico y cruzaron la frontera e ir para California.
ay qué increíble.
mis papás los dos juntos.
sí sí era una super aventura y
pero imagínate.
hay que un lío.
eso fue un riesgo.
y mi mamá estaba embarazada ya conmigo pues de mí.
ay qué horror qué susto.
y entonces lógicamente durante como esa es esa transición de ahora qué?
sí.
o sea que mi mamá me tuvo a mí en en en en Los Ángeles.
o sea yo de mi cinco.
y cómo cómo hacen cuando llegan allí y lo o sea cuando pasen la frontera que pas que que lo
lo que pasa es.
o sea ya estando en Los Ángeles.
y ellos te te consideran ya te dan
cómo es?
uh si tú tú eres una persona nacida.
no claro en tu caso sí pero tus papás cómo hicieron?
en Estados Unidos tú eres americana.
no importa porque ello no tienen por qué cogerlos y y y digamos um
estaban
deportarlos porque ya estaban dando a luz en un hospital.
eso no lo pueden hacer eso es ilegal.
oh ya.
ah mira.
eso es ilegal.
eso no se puede hacer.
tú no puedes coger y y mientras deja una persona
no lógico.
en una situación médica coger y
claro.
sí deportarlos.
eso no
eso tiene que hacer bajo investigaciones.
y bueno realmente mi papá tenía creo que si no estoy mal veintiséis veintisiete años.
y mi mamá tenía tenía diecinueve años cuando nací yo.
imagínate.
wow ay que locura.
es super crazy mi mamá me cuenta la historia y yo me he quedado así yo.
sí sí sí.
o sea no es algo que uno imagínate.
claro.
tiene que ser uno tiene que tener berraquera para cer eso.
sí sí sí sí.
y ya y bueno básicamente ellos vivieron aquí todo el tiempo y.
ok.
lógicamente mis papás son colombianos o sea ellos no.
sí sí lógico.
son ciudadanos americanos ahora porque son naturalizados.
ah ok ok.
pero siguen siendo colombianos.
lógico.
y bueno en fin ya
ay pero que bueno no, siempre es bueno tener a la familia aquí.
esa es una gran cosa.
sí sí.
es que lo que te digo yo.
soy super apegada a.
o sea soy muy independiente.
claro.
para todo que es lo mío.
sí sí sí.
en particular.
pero soy una persona muy familiar.
claro sí yo también.
me aterra la soledad.
me aterra estar eh sola por ajá lejos.
claro.
a mí me encanta la bulla mis hermanitas.
claro rico.
mis papás y eso regañando mi mamá
sí sí sí.
y.
lógico.
como que sentirme en ese calor de familia.
sí aparte de que es la única gente que realmente te puede dar un también un consejo que sea bueno sabes?
aparte que uno puede conocer mucha gente en la vida.
pero realmente tu familia es la única que siempre
tu familia es tu familia.
it's like the tie.
estuvo está y estará allí se queda.
no y yo apren yo aprendí ya después de vieja.
pero yo yo no tenía muy buena relación cuando vivía en Venezuela.
pero yo creo que cuando nos mudamos para acá cambió impresionantemente.
porque vivimos las dos solas.
nos tocó vivir solas a las dos y nos
y era sabes inventábamos así como mi mamá habla.
lo que pasa es que les tocó una situación diferente en el sentido de que.
lógico.
dependían la una de la otra.
exacto.
y solamente se tenían la una a la otra.
eso.
entonces tiene que llegar un momento en que
y no había más nadie de donde eres tú.
you have to bond together.
exacto.
there's no other way around it.
mmhm.
but it was tough.
the the first year I wanted to to go back to Venezuela you know.
I didn't like it at all.
the first year was really hard.
no obviously because you're used to it.
same thing happened to me.
cause you don't know nobody and it and it's hard.
like I've I've seen here is hard to make friends.
it's hard to like to have good friends that you can you know
mmhm.
rely on.
it's like these people that work with you and that's about it.
when you go to school these people may leave.
these people that are here you're not gonna see them you know.
ever again I know.
and in May instead in Venezuela when once you start your career that's gonna be the people you're gonna be for five years together.
so it's like you know you go to their houses you go to.
exactly I was talking you know it's funny cause I was talking to my boyfriend last night about this.
mmhm.
he just graduated from you know college.
he's an architect.
in Colombia?
he graduated in Colombia.
ok.
and the funny thing is that I was talking to him because I was telling him how different it is you know from Colombia here.
right.
because I had the experience as well.
right.
you know I I I was there for two years.
ok.
and for those two years it was the same people.
if anything.
exactly.
people just you know dropped off or they filled.
right there it is exactly.
courses or they filled the semester or whatever it was.
but every semester you saw the same people.
the same people.
the same classes same schedule the same days.
right right.
it didn't change at all you know what I mean it.
I know.
and here you jump from one group of people to another.
right.
you really don't.
no the other subject that I'm taking the other class is like I don't know nobody.
I don't know their names.
I don't know where they work.
yeah I I guess the difference
I have no idea!
between here and there is that there you actually get to you know
you actually make friends like real friends.
exactly right right.
because you know those are important years of your life.
exactly.
number one.
no you even work together.
number two you're sharing the same you know career.
same ideas.
exactly experiences.
same experiences exactly.
I even work with my my like my close friends.
and you you actually you know get good friends.
right.
here it's uh almost impossible.
yeah it's true.
cause you'll have different schedu you know from every every other person.
I guess when you're going to the career career you know in the you know not the core you know classes maybe I don't know.
not uh not even because you know what I think anyway I mean
in my case when when I go to dental school.
mmhm.
yes it's gonna be much more you know um challenging.
and you know I I guess the classes are gonna be mandatory for everyone at
right.
you know specific scheduling.
right.
but I don't think that it's gonna be so like
the classes number one are not gonna be small guaranteed.
mmhm.
whereas in you know Colombia Venezuela they're smaller.
right.
and you you know the amount o the number of people that go into the class
exactly.
and number two it's not you know personalised.
mmhm.
you're never gonna get to have that relationship specially with your teachers.
right.
where in Colombia or Venezuela you you know just Latin America
exactly yeah yeah.
countries in general you do.
exactly.
you know what I mean?
and you know it's funny because I was talking to him last night about that and he was all.
yeah.
because he's moving here.
and here is more you know people is like you know competing competing.
plus that fact that here plus that fact that here most of the people you know we're in the in a country where everything is you know consuming and consuming and you know.
time flies.
mmhm.
you really don't have time for yourself so.
exactly.
what happens is that everyone has debts.
everyone has you know bills to pay.
mmhm.
everyone has to take care of their own stuff.
right.
everyone works in other words.
mmhm.
in Colombia in Venezuela you depend on your parents.
exactly.
and your daddy is paying for all your career.
that's true and all you do is study and that's it.
, and everything that you know if comes along the way with within those years.
you know that that you're still in school and your career.
exactly right.
if you wanna go out.
if you wanna eat somewhere.
if you wanna buy this.
mmhm.
materials you know instruments
mmhm you don't need to worry no.
tuition everything you you you don't worry about anything but studying.
mmhm exactly that's true.
so you do have time for yourself.
and plus you know that's why everything's more you know personalised.
whereas here the schedules might be different for everyone.
right.
because of jobs and then
no and people here they have two jobs it's crazy.
er for me I work from seven thirty in the morning.
mmhm.
till four in the afternoon.
right.
that's only because I'm now in in school.
right.
before when I wasn't in school yet I would work twelve hours.
from seven thirty in the morning.
wow.
till eight nine p m.
wow.
it's crazy.
it's crazy.
horrible eso era horrible.
porque terminas agotada.
sí sí lógico.
no ya estaba yo misma así oh my god.
no no yo tenía un agotamiento.
pero te lo digo llegaba el viernes y yo lo único que quería era dormir.
dormía todo el día y el resto de la noche.
sí igual que yo.
todo el sábado por la mañana.
todo el domingo era una cosa.
ay sí sí intensivo.
y cuando llegaba el lunes llegaba el lunes así otra vez.
y yo decía dios mío no puede ser.
increíble.
sí igual mi esposo me decía hay que ir al cine el viernes y yo tú sabes que los viernes son muertos.
el viernes no se hace nada.
tú tú trabajas de lunes a viernes?
de lunes a viernes de ocho u ocho y media a cinco.
y sea como sea el trabajo de nosotros es bastante estresante.
sí.
porque por ejemplo Alicia dice que el trabajo de ella sí es estresante.
pero at a different level.
mmhm.
why?
because she deals with more like paperwork.
mmhm.
right.
I and you
mmhm.
we both deal with people.
right.
every day
exactly right.
all day long.
entonces no es solamente el paperwork.
porque también tenemos que hacer el papeleo.
mmhm sí exacto.
es you know es safety.
it's to deal with mmhm.
rules and issues for
sí es delicado.
you for your children and me for my patients.
right.
you know and on top of that it's just the stress of having.
mmhm.
, to deal with with you know people's
complaining.
emotions complaints
that's right.
you know.
sarcasm um
sí de todo.
attitudes.
because people give you attitudes and everything.
and you have to learn to deal with that.
right.
so I think it's even more tiring.
it's more of a difficult job no I I I don't wanna
right of course no dealing with people face to face is like is hard.
it's not easy.
especially like me it's the kids plus the parents plus the you know the staff in there.
the people the directors everyone you know.
exactly.
entonces es difícil es difícil.
tratar con la gente no es fácil.
mmhm.
no creas.
y bueno yo te conté que mi papá tiene el negocio éste del Subway.
sí.
yo trabajo los domingos.
en.
con él.
en el Subway ése.
yo soy la que abro y y
claro.
y en ese shift pues yo soy la jefa de la gente que está trabajando allí conmigo.
ok.
mira el trabajo es bastante o sea tú creerías que trabajar en Subway oh sí big deal nothing.
it is you know.
it's nothing.
claro.
you're actually just you know doing whatever.
mmhm.
haciendo un sándwich limpiando cortando una cebolla nothing.
claro.
pero la gente
sí.
en serio en serio.
que va ahí.
la gente es lo peor.
que trabaja o que va.
bueno gente que va los los clientes.
hay gente es que te hacen la vida imposible.
y yo he tenido problemas con gente porque hay yo sé.
pienso que hay una barrera un límite para todo.
mmhm sí claro.
y no importa el lema éste de aquí de que the customer is always right.
yeah nice when you're the customer it's good that you know that.
mmhm.
they say and they publicise that you know the customer is always right.
exacto.
but when you're the owner the business owner.
or when you're the the the the employer or the employee
mmhm.
and this whole the customer's always right theme
right.
you know it's a pain in the ass.
because  you know you get you get treated like you're nothing.
right.
people people forget that you know people don't even know that I actually own the place!
exactly.
so they all treat me when the customers don't know they'll treat me as if I was you know one of those stupid little girls.
because that's how they treat them.
wow.
and I've had you know several problems with several customers.
because it's ridiculous because of the customer always being right
you you let someone disrespect you.
exactly.
forget it
to me respect is always first.
and what do you do like
no I confront them like
when they
this last Sunday what happened was that the customer walks in right.
so so I you know I took care of him whatever.
I did his sandwiches
and he was with I guess his parents.
ok.
two elderly people that's like a couple husband and wife.
ok.
I'm guessing it's his parents whatever.
ok.
so um they walk in whatever.
I took care of them I.
you know I made them sandwiches.
and then we used to give out our courtesy cups for water.
mmhm.
just because it doesn't happen in every Subway.
right.
it it all depends on the owner.
ok.
if the owner wants to do it.
mmhm.
or the manager you know.
if they approve it.
right.
and what was happening is that people weren't you know taking water.
they were actually taking soda from the fountain machine.
oh.
and that's a loss for us.
right.
in money daily.
so what we did was we you know we weren't we weren't um gonna give out courtesy cups any more.
right.
so this man comes you know last Sunday whatever.
when I go to charge him he asks me for three courtesy cups.
and I tell him I'm because he was used to going whatever and getting the cups.
and I tell him sorry sir but we're no longer giving you know courtesy cups.
because we've had several issues with several clients.
mmhm.
and we're not doing it any more.
and so he responded to me he said.
let me just remember like the exact words.
he goes to me he goes.
so what am I supposed to do drink water out of my hands?
like with that you know with sarcasm.
right right right.
and I was already upset at something.
so I went off on him.
I told him.
well if you wanna drink water out of your hands like an animal go ahead be my guest that's not my problem.
I don't care.
now if you wanna drink like a normal human being you know like an educated person.
just ask for a soda right up.
you buy one of these cups which are you know the paper cups?
right.
these paper cups are the ones that you have to purchase for soda.
mmhm.
and I'm gonna have to charge you as if you were buying a soda.
right.
ah this is ridiculous.
I told him yeah.
it might be ridiculous to you but you know what the word courtesy means?
that's up to us if we wanna give it for free or not.
exactly it's uh optional.
it's optional.
right.
it's not like Subway is obligating us to give out courtesy
because the word says it all courtesy cups!
I had it out with the guy I had it out with the guy.
how old was he like?
he was like a teenager?
what?
he was like a teenager or something?
no he was a grown up and like forty seven year old fifty year old man.
oh my gosh.
I can't believe
and that's when I told him that I didn't you know appreciate neither was I gonna tolerate his sarcasm.
right.
because I find it ridiculous that you would talk to you know a a working person an employee like that.
right.
and then he wanted to speak to the manager and I told him that I was the owner so then.
there was nothing he could do about it.
exactly well that's good at least.
and I told him.
it's either you learn to respect and accept you know the things that are going on.
I was actually pretty nice you know to you when I tried to tell you that we had no cups any more.
mmhm to explain right.
you know I'm actually giving you an explanation when I don't have to give you an explanation if I don't want to.
and you respond to me you know aggressively and with sarcasm.
right.
I'm not gonna tolerate that.
if you like that you can stay.
you can buy a cup.
and you know you're more than welcome to be our client.
mmhm.
we actually appreciate your business whatever.
but if not there's a million Subways out there.
if you really like Subway you can find another one.
oh my god I can't believe it.
así le dije.
porque olvídate la gente la gente te falta el respeto.
se aprovecha sí sí sí sí no le importa.
y en el momento que yo le dije que yo era la dueña.
que que yo era la hija del dueño
el tipo se queda así como que
increíble.
sí
como que miércoles ahora sí
porque ellos o sea lo que te digo la gente
sí piensan que tú
piensan que cualquier trabajador en un restaurante eh eh lo ven como menor.
menos que uno.
sí sí sí sí claro.
y las cosas no deberían de ser así.
y la gente realmente no aprende apreciar.
hasta que le toca.
, lo que es el el el el.
el mesero.
sí el trabajador que sí sí.
el que te sirve en un restaurante.
todo el mundo.
el que no le quiera dar una propina.
hasta que no te toca estar en el el lugar.
uhhuh bueno es verdad.
sí yo lo sé porque mi yo yo trabajé en un retail store también.
o sea que tú no estás en la posición tú no dices miércoles.
es verdad.
que pesada esta gente de verdad.
sí sí sí.
y eso que a mí me toca me toca fácil porque yo soy dueña.
claro.
entonces prácticamente a mí.
sí tú puedes
no tengo ni manager que me esté jodiendo.
exacto.
ni pelearme con ninguno de los employees porque todos me tienen que respetar pues soy la dueña del lugar también.
lógico sí sí sí.
y bueno si tengo problema con un customer también le digo mira.
te puedes tiene la libertad lógico.
te gusta?
bien.
si no goodbye.
sí por lo menos es
entonces eso me da ventaja.
pero para una persona.
que está allí sí
como mis empleados que llegue un tipo de estos.
y se tienen que callar se quedan calladitos tú siempre tienes que quedar callado bueno.
a a decirles se quedan callados pero hablarles así
déjame decirte que yo llego a escuchar.
yo llego a presenciar eso con uno des mis empleados.
y lo mimo que te dije de mí se lo digo de de mi empleado.
claro.
claro.
pero la gente no o sea
ay qué horror.
la gente la gente es así.
es increíble uno uno
sí.
y uno no no la gente no cree hasta inclusive en el consultorio.
o sea yo trabajo con un con un excelente doctor.
no sé si has escuchado de él en el momento.
él salía el le dicen el el doctor de las celebridades especialmente lo.
cómo se llama él?
Roberto Javier Gutiérrez.
a lo mejor lo he visto sí.
es colombiano de Baranquilla.
y bueno él ha hecho makeovers a actrices y actores mejicanos colombianos y ahí va
ok oh.
ha ido Selma mejor dicho es un montón de gente allí.
sí.
sí sí.
entonces él me ha conocido.
y realmente la mayoría de nuestros pacientes son pacientes tú sabes.
sí sí.
que tienen un estatus económico bastante alto.
hmm claro.
no son pacientes que llegan con un seguro.
sí sí sí.
varios sí lo tienen.
pero el noventa por ciento de los pacientes es puro cash income every day.
wow wow.
entonces tú sabes si tú crees que tú pensarías uno como por sentido común pensaría que son más educados
sí no.
la gente que tiene plata.
no al contrario.
que la gente que no la tiene.
son más groseros.
y mira la gente que no tiene tanta plata y no tiene los recursos económicos tan.
a veces somos aún más respetuosos.
son más respetuosos y humildes.
sí es verdad.
y al doctor lo tratan de doctor
mmhm.
así le hablan no sí señor no señor no sé qué.
mmhm sí sí sí.

se creen que
ignorantes en su mundo porque realmente tratan a todo el mundo como una miércoles pues
sí sí sí.
prácticamente.
y y las cosas no no tienen por que ser así.
increíble verdad.
es increíble yo no yo te lo juro.
la educación no se compra yo creo que es algo que viene de la familia de como tú crezcas y toda esa cosa.
exactamente.
exactamente pero hay gente que llega allí y y realmente
también hay pacientes con mucha plata
tenemos pacientes franceses.
sí.
tenemos una pareja de franceses que han estado con el doctor por lo menos como por diez años.
y el señor es lo más educado que yo he conocido en toda mi vida.
sí sí wow.
o sea es un señor señor.
por eso te digo son gente.
y tienen plata la que tú no te alcanzas a imaginar.
claro.
pero es una persona bien educada.
no y sabes que pasa yo creo que hay gente también si tienen plata de que nacen también entonces.
sí de cuna.
las costumbres en el que sí a lo mejor sí tienen una buena educación.
pero gente que a lo mejor que si son ricos por fama o porque es una celebridad ese.
eso no sabes a lo mejor fueron se hicieron ricos de la noche a la mañana.
exacto.
si esa gente
new money que le llaman.
sí ahí mismo agarran fama y se olvidan de todo.
pero yo también yo admito que yo que trabajé en un retail store me yo hasta ya me lloraba así de mal de que los clientes lo mal que te tratan.
en serio.
lo mal que te tratan y yo digo dios mío.
tú trabajas en dónde perdón?
en Brooks Brothers.
ok.
que no lo hay el no nunca casi nunca tenía yo tú sabes dificultades con clientes porque son me tratan también gente un nivel.
o sea no es cualquiera que vaya a comprar.
son gente muy que ya va sabe lo que quiere no te molesta mucho no sé qué.
pero también está el cliente que te que la las tiendas cierran a las nueve y la media de la noche.
y entran a las nueve y veinticinco te desarmaban toda la tienda y
y entonces se se ponían bravos porque tu les dices que las tiendas ya se van a cerrar.
entonces siempre se armaron que les estás botando que no sé qué.
o sea gente que te armaban un lío y de paso no compraban nada y
mmhm.
y aquí el escándalo.
pero sí.
sí.
a veces una vez me tocó también una pareja que yo tratando de ayudar al hombre porque estaba cargando una cantidad de camisas.
y estaba con su esposa y yo le digo.
bueno quiere que le yo le si es lo que ya lleva varios si yo se lo puedo tener.
y ahí no hacemos comisión así no es que sabe que era venta mía y yo me iba a pelear.
no yo le digo para qué si el hombre pudiera caminar por la tienda más fácil.
y él.
no no.
la mujer le pone una cara así él.
no no tranquilo.
él se ponía todo nervioso entonces.
al rato lo veo con más cosas y le digo.
no se preocupe.
téngalas aquí que en cualquier cosa si quiere cambiar es para que hacerle la más más confortable.
y la mujer me.
claro todo esto en inglés.
la mujer me ha empezado a decir las miles groserías en español.
ella pensó que yo era gringa que yo era una americana.
y entonces.
esta idiota que no sé qué que por qué no se va que no esta así.
y yo entonces y le le hablo en español enseguida le dije.
no tranquila no se preocupe.
que le tenga todo lo que tenga allí y yo no hay problema.
y por la misma se fue la mujer casi que se quería morir.
porque me dijo todas las groserías que creo que se conocía del.
si claro porque ella ella que diría a esta boba digámos de todo.
sí sí sí fastidiosa no sé qué.
o sea sí.
pero claro estoy diciendo fastidiosa.
pero me una cantidad de groserías.
y al hombre le dio una pena.
y ella después le dijo al al manager le dijo.
ah no que ella nos estaba atendiendo para que me diera la venta.
y le digo.
no no se preocupe que aquí no ganamos por comisión.
o sea como que más le debe de haber chocado porque dirá ésta estaba loquita porque le diéramos la venta y
sí claro.
y yo digo.
no aquí no se trabaja es por horas sabes por
para ayudarle exacto.

cada  que salimos cada  que oye el tremendo tip el tremendo o sea porque uno dice dios mío esta gente.
uno aprende de verdad que sí de verdad que sí.
o sea y si tú ves a alguien que está de mal humor.
o sea déjala que esté con su mal humor.
porque tú no sabes quién fue el que vino antes de ti para decirle una cosa.
a lo mejor le habrán insultado.
le habrán dicho de todo.
y la pobre una reacción.
o sea no vas a estar todo el tiempo sabes.
exacto.
y la gente no entiende eso.
o sea yo pienso que uno está de mal humor y que es porque no le gusta su trabajo algo así.
sino que tú no sabes que pasó antes de que tú llegaras.
exactamente.
o tu jefe te dijo alguna cosa.
o te pasó algo uno no sabes.
o sea que esa de juzgar o sea.
pero bueno si si no te gustó tu trabajo olvídate si no te gusta ya sabes.
y uno en seguida ya eho eh juzgar rápido a la gente.
sí.
pero saber entender que por lo que uno pase por lo que uno
entonces yo digo la veo de mal humor y uno tratando de
hacerle tú sabes más bien hacerle una gracia hacerle algún comentario para que el día no le sale tan horroroso no porque
claro.
no es fácil de verdad que no.
hmm.
y customer service a la gente que le toca trabajar en customer service eso es el terror.
yo no sabría que.
mi esposo era por teléfono.
y le tocó una vez trabajar para Direct T V.
pero luego era por teléfono y que no es tan personal.
eso eso es lo que yo le decía.
es algo más indirecto porque.
sí sí sí pero igual
tú puedes esconder toda la ira que tengas.
y puedes querer explotar.
y colgar el teléfono!
y pegarle un puño a la pared.
o colgar y decir que se te cayó la llamada cualquiera estupidez!
claro claro.
porque realmente no hay ese contacto.
sí sí físico no.
así de tú a tú en persona.
claro.
cuando ya la cosa es eh o sea realmente en persona
sí sí sí.
es bastante difícil.
sí es verdad.
porque el el la clave está en aprender a controlarse uno
claro.
como el que está prestando el servicio.
sí ser diplomático.
pero a veces salir diplomático no sale.
no pero a la la la diplomacia se me!
te lo juro a mí a veces me dan unas ganas de coger y
estar ya de una forma.
sí sí.
de verdad porque imagínate.
y uno no creería que en un consultorio médico.
sí pasen estas cosas.
tú dirías bueno la gente respeta por lo menos porque es un doctor.
hay gente que le llega y le dice barbaridades hasta al médico!
al doctor.
ay dios mío!
y es el el doctor pues es mi jefe es un señor.
es el hombre no le dice nada a absolutamente a nadie.
o sea le puedes decir por ejemplo mira no comparto tu opinión o no sé.

yo acabo de colgar el teléfono con la paciente que viene para acá.
me acaba de confirmar.
me dice que llega en cinco minutos.

es que Roberto me dijo que viniera que viniera a tal hora y es más.
ay dios mío como si fuese íntimo amigo
llegué llegué un poquito tarde de lo que él me había dicho.
tú me vas a decir que no me vas a atender que no sé qué.
entonces ella le dijo que lo sentía que le si lo quería le esperara.
eso fue en el front desk en el reception.
mmhm.
ella se entra.
habla con claro.
al cuarto de ella.
en otro teníamos otro paciente en un cuarto.
la pobre señora una señora vieja.
parece unos cincuenta y pico años.
imagínate tener que escuchar todo ese escándalo.

después sonaba el teléfono y.
y empieza este hombre.
no sé qué pendeja.
allí que la esa esa tipa no me quiere atender.
ella ha ido que está haciendo mira contestando llamadas porque la señora llamaba de emergencia al celular y la estaba ignorando por teléfono.
y no me quiere atender.
y entonces vaya hablar con esa otra señora que es otra paciente.
a mí no me interesa quien sea.
yo soy Juan García.
ay!
mira!
yo me quedé así.
y entonces yo no decía nada porque yo no me quería meter.
porque entonces el problema habría sido más grande.

yeah.
yeah.
bye.
I'll leave that there.
when everybody gets out of the way I'll copy those.
copy?
go ahead.
no I've got a bunch.
I've got a bunch.
I got a bunch.
sneak in when you can.
no problem.
thank you.
ah ah.
did you ask?
I'm done.
ay I know.
yeah.
I was like.
oh vas a coger tu pelo cortico como Connor?
entonces él dijo.
no cortico no es muy es muy chiquito para mí.
mal.
so he said he was getting like medium haircut.
I know it because his used to his long hair and stuff.
yeah.
pero qué más?
qué estábamos hablando antes de eso?
normal no?
I don't know.
bueno.
let's see hmm.
mi clase de chino está super interesante.
pero cómo así o sea.
oh my goodness pero es que son tantas cosas.
sí pues.
hoy perdí la clase.
no fui.
porque no encontré parking.
horrible.
no.
no fui a la clase.
but are you remembering all this stuff.
it is like a lot of characters and data.
memorization.
es como matemáticas.
but it's a lot.
I hate maths too so.
es chévere.
I wouldn't be good at Chinese.
I'd be better at Hebrew.
yeah.
ajá.
it is like.
no.
don't don't act like you know Chinese.
mira no de verdad.
um.
entonces pues hoy están votando.
hay votaciones en el colegio.
estaba preguntando o sea.
para qué carrizo le sirve a uno ser
ah I'm president.
for what?
ah para servir la universidad.
bueno supuestamente lo ideal sería servir a la comunidad y representar los intereses de los estudiantes.
a la administración de la universidad.
por eso lo hacen.
mm.
pero yo creo los estudiantes hacen como que.
ah I don't care.
yeah.
most students don't care about like voting and stuff.
but lately they've been like out there pushing it hard.
like a million people wanna give you a flyer and food.
yeah because I think most of those people are because they don't live here so is like.
I've just come here to study that's it.
yeah.
I don't I don't mind.
people usually hicieron que like when I was eating lunch.
I was eating in Subway and then.
Subway with the cup.
yeah.
um I was eating food and the girl in front of me was saying like.
oh I was at the library those people were bothering me.
and telling me but I don't care about that I really don't care about this place.
so like she is kind of like shows the typical attitude of like.
yeah.
people not want it to go.
but in my case probably if I would live here I would care because they can deal with issues and stuff.
yeah.
I think most students would be more involved if they had more time.
but they have a full schedule.
they may have a job.
and then they have to study.
so they're like.
I don't.
that's wasting my time.
they don't stop to like find out about who's president cause they're too busy.
and I understand them cause that happens to me.
but I don't know but I don't know if those are like doing campaign and getting people to know their their ideas.
yeah yeah.
they are?
some times also
but only through flyers like they just show you their flyers and talk to.
they're not doing like a whole campaign like an official campaign.
exactly.
you don't really know why you're voting for.
yeah.
who's that people I just saw.
people don't like to read.
but it's kind of funny.
it's interesting.
ajá?
people don't like to read.
ellos prefieren estar así como ver.
y que allá está el man parado entonces.
yeah.
who is like looks the nicest like oh.
yeah.
like oh this is a good looking guy oh.
oh that one is some nerd.
I don't want to vote for him.
yeah.
something like that.
or like this person gave me cupcakes.
I'll vote for her.
but look.
but I think it's funny because it represents like how the nation is.
like people don't sit down and.
listen to our campaign.
they just look at the flyers and like.
oh I want to vote for a man.
or I want to vote for a woman or a black man like Green Alec.
oh a black man as a president would be awesome.
but they're going by the image or like a woman as a president.
but like it's a big issue anyway.
like that oh my goodness.
eh.
but I don't know.
I would have to live in here.
I want to live in here.
on campus?
yo quiero vivir aquí sí porque es chévere.
por qué?
es super cool.
mira vea tengo de todo.
tengo un sitio para cortarme el pelo aquí.
tengo el sitio para lavar la ropa aquí.

cafeteria exactly dry cleaning.
ah tus pero tú haces dry tu haces dry clean para toda la ropa?
pero para lavar you get a.
no pero para cosas cosas así grandes.

ah.
para por ejemplo ropa normal así por aquí debe haber un laundry.
dónde?

de pronto en los en los dormitorios.
o incluso en los apartamentos.
en los dorms they have a laundry room.
ah.
I think so.
I don't know.
that'd be cool.
sí.
actually yo quiero ir a China.
y me gustaría.
y vivir allá.
y enseñar.
pero la cosa es que es muchos meses.
y como estoy involucrada en la inglesia.
pues a veces no me veo como en otro país por más de un meses.
por ejemplo.
you never know.
maybe the Lord sends me over there.
exactly.
porque sí por ejemplo si si pues dios te manda para allá.
tiene que ser así o sea.
es como como hay un yo estaba viendo una una película.
ajá.
de un tipo que él vivía en U K.

and he didn't know to speak Spanish.
y dios le di lo despierta una noche.
y le dice que él tiene que ir a a California.

thirty seven percent it's a lot of people.
porque hay una necesidad grande en África.
the Caribbean is like not much and and in Latin America are the top ones.

I went to Guatemala as a city.

pero en la inglesia la gente nos decían.
no te pares porque la gente era tan pequeña.
ajá.
que si nosotros porque.
iglesia es bien tradicionales allá.
donde la gente se para.
aleluya.
entonces cuando nos parábamos nos decían.

la iglesia comenzaba a las siete.
salíamos ahí a las doce de la noche.

I wanna go here here here here here.

I know all of that because in my history class we're estamos viendo todo eso.
ajá.
oh my goodness pero es demasiado.
como eh eh cuando vimos Rome.
the Roman empire.
yo dije quiero ir a Roma ya.
estábamos viendo también las Egipto todos esos.
ajá.
también quiero ir.
ahorita estamos viendo es esto mismo.
a Mexico South America.
wow tú me hiciste un sueño que tuve de Italia.
and stuff.
hablando de Roma.
y siguen.
y entonces estamos viendo las ruinas Machu Picchu Tenochtitlán y todo eso de los de los Mayan Aztecs.
y todo es súper interesante?
sí.
o sea yo las veo y yo.
wow I wanna go there.
I wanna know.
I wanna watch.
I want experience.
cool.
quiero experimentar todo eso.
pero quiero.
oye sigue.
all around the world.
just para captar por mi vista todo.
chévere chévere.
sí.
porque es cool.
yo he soñado con dos lugares.
y sin nunca ir ahí.
uno es China.
soñé que estaba en China.
que estaba en frente de una universidad en China.
y pero había un ataque en los buses.
estaban atacando a los estudiantes.
y nos sentamos ahí al lado.
y todos los estudiantes estaban corriendo.
raro.
y el otro sueño que estaba jugando fútbol en Italia.
what?
yo qué sueño raro.
que habían unas unas calles eran así como esto.
las ca en vez de las calles ser de de concrete.
eran de estos bloquecitos.
y yo estaba jugando soccer.
y nos metíamos en los.
y había un círculo donde estaban alrededor de edificios.
y adentro ahí estaba jugando soccer.
y yo.
qué raro.
Kazakhstan.
eso no es de donde era Borat?
Kazakhstan.
yeah.
Borat was from there.
but it is so big that country?
no dónde?
here fifty four.
fifty five.
no.
ah fifty four.
look.
it's huge!
yeah.
my mom didn't even know it existed.
she's like.
it's bigger than Colombia.
ah.
my mom started laughing like.
aha Kazakhstan he made that up.
and I'm like no.
no exist.
talk like that.
?
Kurdish republic.
Morocco.
ay Morocco is cool.
pues sí.
it's just here.
Morocco.
next to.
you can go to Spain.
or those countries also.
you couldn't travel because if you're helping people there just doing that.
what do you mean?
because if for example I mean in in the case you're going to Morocco si estás ahí tú no puedes decir.
no me voy a pasar para España.
a lo menos que algo pase y y dicen.
es que por eso es tan chévere estar aquí like tener la vida con dios.
me dicen.
ah mira resulta que te necesitan en España este fin de semana porque una familia tan tan tan tan tan.
y bajas ahí.
sí pero sí sí sí.
I mean.
si si estás en Marruecos nada más.
es para que sirvas en Marruecos.
porque para eso estás.
en España no está aquí so.
you wouldn't need to go to Spain.
pues no es un
pero si un fin de semana quieres ir a Morroco.
country ah?
a España.
ah en España.
I don't think you could because you're volunteer in there.
oh but they give you.
I think you are twenty four seven.
yeah but they probably give you a day off two days off.
yeah but just going for one day.
what happens if you're working here?
and Spain is over there.
it's like being in in Boston.
and you want just go to Mexico.
and you have only one day off.
that's.
not possible.
I guess so.
I don't know.
but I wanna go where is Mozambique?
Mozambique.
Mozambique.
Mozambique.
thirty six right there.
this is Madagascar.
I know where's Madagascar.
ah.
Japan.
no Philippines.
Philippines.
Japan is this one.
Japan is
no are you crazy?
yes it's.
no it's not.
it's an island that it's just next to China.
are you crazy?
no.
over here.
that's Japan.
and what is this?
Thailand.
like part of Malaysia.
yeah.
Philippines.
Malaysia.
Japan.
Rome I wanna go Rome ok.
experience.
to teach English in another country it's super fun.
well you gotta know the language of the other
yeah yeah I spoke to the lady who give me the brochure.
and she said that they teach you English for two years.
I mean not English.
they teach you the the coun the language of the country you're going to for two years and the
wow but this program is long.
yeah it's twenty seven months you have to volunteer.
twenty seven months?
that's more than two years.
yeah.
no.
I won't do that.
sí un it's a long time right?
yeah.
it's only volunteer.
well they pay for everything.
yeah.
but it's like you you don't get a saving.
but.
it's like.
for example if your career is doing that it's good.
but my case wouldn't be.
because this this helps you to develop a curriculum.
it's not about developing curriculum either.
but pero es para ayudar a la gente y todo eso.
mira esa vaca flaca.
oh my goodness.
hasta la vaca está
estás segura que es una vaca?
sí.
are you sure it's a cow?
or a horse?
it's look like a cow.
no it is a cow.
even the cow is starving dude.
that's horrible.
no se la pueden comer.
si las matan nada más tienen para el huesito.
hueso.
interesting.
is a volunteer in Mongolia.
it's super cool.
but it's an experience of a lifetime.
a ver?
let me see.
oh my God.
even if you don't go with peace corps it's like if you go on mission work.
that's so awesome.
I love it.
you get to meet so so many people
but uh
sí después le digo lo que era.
ah.
me da pena no lo quería rechazar.
what was that?
ah un amigo.
pero después yo le digo.
ah es que estamos haciendo un recording.
ah.
pero de todas maneras no
él podía venir.
sí?
sí.
ay yo no lo sabía.
whatever.
ya el te dijo.
if you've to answer the phone.
you can answer it.
don't worry.
ah bueno bueno.
de todas maneras.
it's just talking.
qué es esto?
oh look.
a butterfly!
dónde?
oh my God!
it's huge!
de qué hablas?
ay no!
un butterfly.
rosado y negro.
hay balones ahí arriba.
no sé.
te estás divirtiendo ahora?
yo creo.
viste techo que es super cool?
sí a ti te gusta ese diseño?
ah?
a ti te gusta ese diseño?
um sí y no.
o sea it's like.
a mí no me gusta.
experimentándolo.
se ensucia.
lo ves.
es que de eso se trata architecture.
de qué?
de experimentar todo y verlo.
o sea yo yo yo he yo he de verdad que cuando uno estudia eso uno cambia el concepto en como ve todo.
uno empie te empiezas a desarrollar como a develop esas cosas de de ver todo diferente de forma diferente.
like the approach you have for everything.
entonces como ves este este scenario.
tú sabes yo lo veo y como que me inspiro para hacer algo.
lo estoy viendo no estoy pendiente del espacio sino que estoy pendiente de la estructura.
estoy pendiente de de cómo circula la gente.
de la luz.
de que es muy oscuro.
verdad?
es muy oscuro.
sí porque de repente ellos querían hacer.
y es como que muy.
hacer algo bastante macizo pero querían mantener la conexión entre esta parte de college y la otra parte.
porque si no hubiese estado este hueco acá las personas hubiesen tenido que dar toda la vuelta alrededor.
and that would be like bothersome because.
entonces qué hubieran podido hacer.
nada this was the only options.
pero como la librería is so huge you gotta make a whole to make a a room over there.
yeah but how do they how will cómo lo puedes improve?
but it's good also.
because.
ah I don't know.
the building would have to be thinner.
but what's good about this it's because is this deep it allows the air go beneath the the building so
so that's why this is so fresh.
they did it in that way because this is always like that.
yeah.
aunque haya aunque haya brisa fuera o no haya brisa fuera el aire siempre va a entrar por aquí como
brisa.
imagínate.
it's like pressure.
todo el aire está fuera pero se mete por un huequito así.
siempre va a fluir.
después esta parte siempre va a estar refrescada así.
pero por ejemplo ellos pudieron haberlo hecho más clara poniendo un piso más claro.
sí pero
en vez de hacer concrete esto con un piso de marble se vería super cool.
sí.
o en vez de usar pintura gris usar pintura clara.
pero después cuando llueve se pone muy slippery.
slippery.
esa es la cuestión.
pero y si también sabes lo que I picture?
dos edif el la librería separada entre dos edificios y después en el medio un corredor que la gente puede cruzar al otro lado del de la librería.
y así hubiera espacio.
ah.
pero sería el mismo tamaño el edificio pero estás quitándole todo ese hueco para ese corredor.
sí.
es es.
entonces
estás gastando
estás gastando espacio.
ah.
eso se llama efficiency.
o bueno este hueco más alto.
y el edificio más alto.
o sea sigue siendo siete pies.
pero todo más alto para que ese hueco sea más largo.
that would mean more.
pero para la gente.
o sea es como se.
pero es que esa es la cuestión.
would it be people friendly?
like.
I like furniture and buildings and I like people friendly not.
como ayer por ejemplo en el bookstore al frente a mí me gustó ese hueco.
cuál hueco?
el huequito donde están los todos los paintings en la en la pared.
ah sí.
y es un poco de sillas.
se siente así todo como comfortable that.
ahí ahí todo.
sí.
te puedes tirar y eso.
pero lo que pasa es que tienes que cuando ya estás en estas cosas en arquitectura y eso tienes que ver que hay mucha mucha cosa más que tienes
intereses del dinero?
claro porque budget.
tú diseñas pero tú no eres el que está pagando por el diseño.
sí.
somebody else.
you design it for somebody else.
pero si totalmente tendrías que
o sea.
entonces ellos te.
si
ellos más o menos te dicen podemos gastar tanto y.
pero tú tienes que limitarte a eso.
pero vamos a decir.
no estoy hablando de actual realistic jobs.
estoy hablando de tu creatividad.
o sea tú diseñar algo porque te gusta por el aesthetically.
like porque te gusta.
ay yo me comí un así de grande.
qué ver un pan con el
yo tengo hambre ahora quiero
no porque te vi yawning.
quiero comer.
me comí unas papitas de Jane.
oh my goodness.
Jane.
y cómo está Jane?
Jane?
pues ahí en su casa.
yo estuve cuando yo la vi el primer día yo estuve bien con ella.
no se si te contó.
ay sí.
que le digo.
Jane ya por favor.
ay no.
cállate.
ay pero ay ay.
me decía.
ay ay Connor.
pero de Gabrielle!
oh no.
oh.
yo papi papi.
yo no me esperaba eso.
discúlpame y perdona.
pero yo dónde quedó dónde quedó?
ah ah no no.
dónde quedó qué.
ella decía.
dónde quedó la la cristiandad y y.
no papi no.
eso no se hace.
no no no no no.
pues yo le decía.
pero y ella se estaba enfocando.
pues sí.
ay yo no sé.
anyway.
oh my goodness.
pero qué tu hiciste eso de verdad?
ell pero mira.
it's like.
no!
le dije.
toma la cámara.
y me fui.
porque estaba hirviendo la sangre me estaba hirviendo.
no sabía qué hacer.
why?
porque mira.
yo estaba llamado a gente verdad?
y ese viene.
y era un grupo grande.
y era el domingo.
estaba ahí por cuatro horas solamente.
y ella se tiró enfrente del.
o sea ni se tiró enfrente de mí.
cogió mi cliente.
lo llevó.
le tomó fotos.
al cliente le llegó tres cuatro familias.
y le tomó fotos a todos ellos.
y les vendió y ya.
quedó en su número.
entonces yo.
ok Jane yo juego contigo pero no se.
no te pases.
o sea
ella lo que me dijo fue que como tú tenías a un montonón de gente y ya ahí.
le estabas tomando fotos entonces que llegó otra persona.
no.
ella me lo cogió desde antes.
no llegó gente.
ella después comenzó a torcer la historia.
no es que te es para ayudarte.
no Jane no fue para ayudarme.
tú lo llamaste antes que yo lo pude hacer llegar a la cámara.
entonces yo por eso me molesté porque ella asumió y tom.
sentí que estaba abusando de la amistad.
o sea como se estaba riendo y todo.
se cogió el cliente.
y yo me fui.
pero de todas maneras para mí fue una lección porque mira.
cuando yo estaba hirviendo verdad?
y yo sentía al señor diciéndome.
cálmate cálmate cálmate.
entonces dios me dijo.
no te preocupes que yo te voy a mandar otra venta que va a ser aún más.
pero yo no tuve paciencia para esperar en el señor.
porque cuando vino ese otro cliente yo sentía algo que me dijo.
este es el cliente.
ese te va a comprar bastante.
pero entonces vino Jane y otra vez me iba a coger la cámara.
y yo ahí es donde se me fue hasta el hasta la cabeza.
yo le dije.
toma la cámara.
y me fui.
porque ella jugando.
ven yo te lo hago.
así riéndose otra vez.
y yo.
oh toma la cámara.
y me fui caminando.
y después regresé.
y le dije.
mira.
y ella me dijo.
ay por qué te pusiste así tal cosa?
no se qué.
y entonces yo le dije.
.
yo le dije.
yo preferí no reaccionar así.
obviamente no me hubiera gustado reaccionar así.
pero ya me molestó porque sentí que te estabas like pasando.
entonces ahí ya hablamos tal cosa.
y resulta.
el cliente ese que se quedó lo atendió Marta.
y les vendió setenta dólares que era más de lo que Jane les había vendido.
o sea dios tenía la razón.
me estaba mandando el cliente.
pero yo no tuve paciencia para esperar.
y dejar que se me pasara la rabia.
me entiendes?
entonces ahí eh aprendí.
pues ella se estaba poniendo mal.
y yo dije.
pero tú no tienes razón de ponerte mal.
ella no tiene razón de estar rabiosa de nada si ella se metió.
o sea.
me entiendes?
.
esa era una sola persona entonces.
no es que venía.
no.
era una familia toda grande.
pero yo llamé una persona.
ella me quitó esa persona.
entonces como ya me lo quitó atendí el hermano o el amigo de él.
después llegaron más gente pero ella les tomó fotos a todo el grupo.
incluso le dijo a todo el grupo que se pararan juntos.
y les tomó fotos.
morcilla?
no sé.
el de la morcilla fue un poco de negros.
sí fue un poco de negros juntos.
dijo.
digan morcilla!
sí dijeron morcilla.
porque eran cuarenta negros.
ajá ellos.
entonces eso yo ya me estaba viendo
es como si me estaba hirviendo la sangre poquito a poquito.
primero me llamó el cliente.
y dijo.
ah no importa.
después llegó otro otro otro.
y después llegó toda la familia.
y les vendió a otro.
y ni una vez me preguntó.
Gabrielle te ayudo?
o son tuyos.
o nada nada nada.
entonces yo me puse like.
y después todo eso y ya.
atendiéndolos todos.
eso me puso mal.
mal mal mal.
me molesté.
Marta me entendió.
she was like pues cada persona tiene un vaso.
y si tú lo vas llenando
y yo ella ella le dijo a Jane que se estaba exagerado porque yo solo me fui.
ella dijo.
preferiblemente que te hubieras ido que te hubieras explotado aquí.
pero yo en mí misma yo siento que tengo
cómo se dice standard en en en español?
standard?
un estándar.
yo tengo un estándar más alto.
yo nunca me hubiera explotado ahí.
a lo por la o sea yo no lo planeaba.
para mí lo que hice en irme eso fue una explosión.
o sea para mi personalidad eso lo considero una explosión.
aunque Marta dijo.
no estuvo bien lo que hiciste.
tú te fuiste en vez de decir algo.
o ponerte mal acá.
eso está bien.
pero yo sentí que no me hubiera ido.
pero es que en ese momento tenía que haber aplicado la sangre de Jesús porque no había manera de controlar lo que estaba pasando dentro de mí.
entonces me puse súper mal.
pero of course me duele.
o sea me duele porque pues no quiero like dañar mi relación con ella.
ah.
me entiendes?
qué piensais?
qué puedo hacer ahora que ya pasó?
o sea preferiblemente no hubiera hecho eso.
yo vi.
guau señor si hubiera mantenido la paciencia tú me hubieras bendecido aún más y todo.
y hubiera hablado con ella calladamente.
pero en ese momento no tuve self control.
you know what I mean?
I know.
no importa no entienden español.
sí no porque Jane Jane se
la historia que ella me contó es un poquito diferente.
ella y entonces ella le dice a Marta.
cállase la boca.
y después Marta dice.
ella le dijo cállese la boca?
eso es lo que Marta dijo a lo que ella le dijo.
y entonces Marta dijo.
tú me dijiste eso.
y entonces Jane.
no yo no dije eso.
ahí entonces otra hora hablando con Marta.
arguing.

I agree.
my parents have some friends that they knew from
either right after they left Cuba.
there were Cubans.
and they met.
my father met them in Bahamas or something he were.
anyway my father used to tease her.
because she said.
eh you know.
she got older.

decía.

at this rate.
you'll be younger than my child!
do you know.
because she.
and she was nice.
she would also remove.
she would also remove age from her children.
so that you know.
you couldn't figure that out.
he's like.
wait a minute.
he used to tease her.
wait a minute.
your oldest daughter is actually older than my son.
you know.
he used to.
and it got to the point that the joke was she wouldn't even know how old she is.
and she she.
ya ni se acuerda.
y mi papá dice.
sabes ella ni se acuerda.
se lleva quitando los años desde que la conozco when she was only thirty two tears old.
she was like.
so why are you telling people you are older than you are?

thank you.
who?
something that you need me to find to for you o no?
mhm right right right.
well well you laugh.
but when you if when you go to the Grand canyon.
I remember one of the first things I thought.
I mean it's a national monument.
it's a park.
but you know.
we are a land obsessed with.
you know.
lawsuits.
you know.
the trails are in some places.
you know.
here is the clift.
as you.
particles that you have further heading down.
you know.
on the top is not.
but you know.
there's a bunch of different trails on the Grand canyon.
and different levels and and stuff.
some of them are only five feet wide.
here is the clift.
uh!
there's nothing on that side.
and I go.
and I.
yeah and I go.
honey.
ah.
it'd be like.
oops I'm so sorry.
I you.
you've been watching way too many murder series.
and then of course.
you know.
some thinking.
how how would you do that?
you know?
require a of freaking.
I thought.
god.
I mean I was pleased.
but I thought.
how do they manage that one?
you know.
and then they have an area that is like a look out.
that you know uh.
I mean it.
it's been a real
it's been there fifty years because it's just one little bar.
and I'm thinking.
this the code?
whe where's the?
that happened.
if we aren't we?
thank you dear.
actually.
you can actually.
once you are done with this one.
let's see what they gave me for you.
because the boxes are ready.
but I haven't really looked at the drawings and what they sent me or anything.
I haven't process those so.
James looked at the same thing I guess.
don't
doesn't Hannah need some drafting help for?
didn't you work on Cooper?
ok.
I keep getting these offers from the people where we order our t shirts from.
yeah for twenty five dollas off so.
I don't know.
because I know there's some people complaining that they didn't do anything that's been ordered.
well it's twenty five dollars off.
fifty dollar minimum purchase.
fifty.
minimum purchase require.
applies to merchandise only when there's not.
include shipping and other fees.
and they think I'm a new Queensborough customer.
which is fine.
so somebody else wants to order?
am a new Queensborough customer?
I'm not really a new Queensborough customer.
but that's ok.
beating them up.
beating them up.
I know.
I always.
those when I go to the zoo I always feel bad for the animals.
although the zoos are much better than they were when you and I were kids.
they were in a in a una caja una jaula.
a chlorified cage.
and that was it.
that's how the zoos used to be.
now this open wide zoos are
you know.
at least they have some semblance of something.
but I always feel bad for the big mammals.
for the big gorilla.
you know.
the the mount gorilla.
for the elephants.
for for the tigers.
because you know they a lot of space.
and when and the and the elephants
I always think they look bored.
you see them.
you.
you know?
you are not talking.
I remember.
I remember going to the Washington zoo when I moved to Virginia.
this was fifteen eighteen years ago.
give or take.
and I hated it.
because it was still the old type zoo that still had a lot of the cages.
they were converting.
they were converting.
and I'm thinking.
man this is my tax dollars.
you know.
and but they had the pandas.
and I still remember going to see the pandas.
and feeling so bad for them.
the there was one inside and one in the top.
and he it's seating on this low mount.
and he is doing this.
I mean I remember I was struck.
this is a.
you know.
this is what we do when we're bored.
he's got to be bored.
you know.
and he looked bored.
I mean I know the panda is not a big moving animal.
so you know
like the hippo.
it just hangs out in the water and it's happy.
but it looked bored.
and I thought
I said I'm never going back to that zoo.
I just can't.
the old zoo yeah.
there's pictures on the house.
the Metro used to be at Crandon park.
in Crandon park.
yeah.
the old metro zoo used to be in Crandon park.
when we were kids.
we were little.
I mean I remember going.
I mean vaguely.
I must have been four.
nowhere.
I do I cannot do.
how do people fall for this stuff?
you know
that they have eighteen million dollar of money in a box.
I well I get form different ones.
how do people fall for it?
I mean
ay.
you know.
you don't need no.
you know.
you don't know this person.
you know?
I I.
you know.
it never sees ceases to amaze me.
how many people wanna be fooled.
dígame.
service county.
there's no colour.
it's all
there's no colour selection.
yes!
it's all staying still.
wu wu wu wu wu.
we don't have any laminates in here.
oh the front.
and why didn't they complain about this?
no your response to him.
your response.
no isn't.
they alwasy do that.
they always do that.
you response to him.
and say.
Smith I am so sorry.
we didn't solid the colour.
however why didn't the contractor say something when he got the drawing back.
you know.
don't give in and say.
I I don't wanna hear this excuse.
be very polite.
I don't wanna.
Hannah.
Hannah.
they are not gonna finish on July eighteen.
so they they're grasping strass.
because they can finish the.
that's a pannel that's glued.
to Dave.
to Dave.
oh that's Paul.
because he has called talking to me.
when he wants a pay application.
I'm the one who signs them.
this is that infamous uh that you the letter.
oh I think that for some reason I think that you were Jeff.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I think.
I guess the letter they addressed to me they just fax it.
this is a thing that Sonia was telling me about.
that we were disqualified or something.
right.
right.
right right right.
something came out.
and we do not seen it.
right.
oh this was just issued yesterday.
but it is an opportunity to go.
but they are not open to the public like are.
but the space doesn't doesn't comfortably feel that way.
right but we can send Sonia or
or Hannah.
right right right.
no it's really the style.
you know.
they do hospital work.
they do lab work.
right.
we we don't write.
if if this is hospital related.
we know.
right.
when we were running with this.
and we got the prototypes Jeff.
so we gotta to be a little positive here.
I know I know I know.
this is what you got?
I guess the letter was addressed to me.
how did you fing that again?
yeah.
Joan just Joan just
I don't know.
I guess.
did I write the the letter?
I must surrender the letter venture.
one of those I remember doing.
uh but I guess Joan sent it to me.
ahí está.
todo tuya.
quieres que te lo mande?
para que lo tengas electrónico?
I just got here today.
because Joan forwarded it to me.
pero cómo se enteraron ustedes?
oh.
like a shortlisted.
oh he saw that.
so that's why he called.
so they just issued it.
bueno pero es not only that.
nosotros no somos los únicos.
and you know.
and you know what?
I think he I think Jeff may be right.
mandaron algo.
and for some reason we didn't get it.
who knows what.
mira hasta ahora.
porque it says due date January.
sí sí sí pero they they just
right right right.
but I'm saying this.
pro ninth.
and they usually say pro eighth.
and they faxed it.
and they faxed it yesterday.
and they faxed it yesterday.
mira allá.
Pérez a Pérez.
who's been doing.
ellos no los conozco.
right.
and I think so have they.
right.
I don't know who they are.
I don't either but I.
right right.
como.
exacto.
y y llevan haciendo esto por años.
and they do public work so it's.
sí exacto.
si fuéramos los únicos.
la calé sí.
pero no somos los únicos.
hay otras.
ah no de verdad.
sí sí.
pero ve why.
they're mostly engineers.
right right right.
no.
para mí es something.
which means we need to be diligent.
we need to be diligent.
bueno entonces hay que quejarse.
how did we how did we find out these projects?
and then there was nothing in?
right right you would have seen.
sí porque yo.
right right right right.
we wanna know because.
because otherwise
I mean.
I mean.
or you can just for the hell of it complain.
right.
it would be nice to find out when the presentations are.
so that.
you know.
, you or I or Hannah or something can go just to to see how other people do things.
le digo.
pero Jeff ellos estaban?
y me dice.
es un public fail form.
pero la la.
en county tienen ese salón grande.
so is very easy to hang out.
pero en county no es tan comfy como eso.
es un imagínate el salón de nosotros de conferencias chiquito.
tiene una mesa como cuatro o cinco gatos sentados ahí.
y entonces tú entras y presentas.
o sea there's no audience space.
no es como el de que lo hacen in a big trailer.
so they have an audience.
pero me dice eh.
it's a public.
I guess ayer se fue de aquí.
y no apagó las luces.
no fui yo.
estás.
pareciera lo más probable.
yo sé que yo he venido.
yo he sido una de las primeras en venir
yo dije.
I have been una de las primeras que he venido.
y he encontrado las luces.
pero no sé si es que tal vez el cleaning group.
mira eh eh
tú utilizas esos papeles para tus niñas pintar?
why not?
uh?
but that means that they have to stick what's drawn in the colouring book.
a blank piece of paper gives them freedom.
my kids loved to paint.
and Paula loves to.
you know.
uh by the little.
you know.
paint paint.
they love to paint.
pero si they are covered from.
you know.
termpera yes.
but you know.
they love to paint.
y se acaban así.
no.
a Paul tiene un un mantelito.
ahí porque me regaló mi hermano.
but Jack doesn't.
but actually Jack is not as messy.
you don't use?
pásalo para acá.
pásalo para acá.
Paula's is now.
now Paula's is green.
and here has a little
oh pinky.
I don't do pink.
but I'm taking the approach if if she owns pink and doesn't see
you know.
me rejecting it.
she'll grow to hate it.
like me.
I know I'm beeing wishful.
I'm beeing wishful.
I know.
I do not wear pink.
ah.
totally different.
yes I have one of these without pink in it.
very girlie.
I with pink.
I wear it a lot since I remember I own it.
Paula is when it goes.
Paula says this morning.
mami you got big feet.
and I got a little feet.
I go.
yes seewetie.
well but inherited her father's genes.
he has little feet for such a tall man.
it can be stainless.
still I don't care.
where do we met?
can we pick anything at A U B?
that the end piece.
but do we have a front elevation?
Anthony will remember.
he's got a very good memory.
is scary how good it is.
I don't either remember.
I don't remember picking a laminate.
I don't either.
I thought it was all and steel.
but I could be wrong.
I mean.
it was supposed we can pull out the job drawings.
and see wheter we picked the colour.
we may have.
the only the other thing is that they also didn't say.
you know.
verify brand and colour.
of the serving line?
stainless steel?
yeah I don't think we picked anything!
no lo que es lo que le dije a Hannah.
they are crunched with time.
they're going to slide into august eighteen.
and they're going to use any excuse to play in the league.
so don't take it personal!
no we saw the texture.
no.
and I told them to book two.
please write them a letter.
because.
no.
do you know how you get them to stop this little crack?
you write a little letter.
complaining of whatever is your problem is.
and you copy.
they get upset.
but they stop with the little supid staff.
they stop with their their their little.
yeah.
no they changed the guy.
it's this guy now.
no Cam Cameron is not the guy anymore.
you know
write a letter today Hannah.
say you have we you are not gonna pay despite the fact that plenty of our conversations you you know you are supposed to have it.
by the way please confirm.
have they submitted that form?
the nine nine zero something or other to the paint people?
but they filled it up.
have they received it back?
has that that guy been out there to say it's ok?
I want it in writing.
because.
really?
what was his problem?
ah bueno.
well.
has not done a very good job out there.
beca because we did we did a
right.
we we did a paint makeup at A U B.
and figured we didn't like that yellow and that blue.
which I never liked to begin with but.
nobody believed me.
and I thought I was being Maria.
how long have they have been shot drawings?
then you put that in there.
you know.
be nice and polite.
but you know.
they're grasping straws.
which means that the cleaning people leave them all alone.
I'm young.
what are you talking about?
it's an appl an apply pannel.
no no no no no no no no!
I want a letter.
I want a letter.
they're wasting paper.
so are we.
no no no.
I want an actual letter in response to their letter.
because an email gets delete delete delete delete.
a letter
right.
made a P D F just like they did but.
ok human resources is about to go get some tea.
so you all behave.
while I'm not here.
she did.
she ride through me.
esta camisita me gusta.
voy a ver si tienen otro color.
ya se me olvidó que marca era.
sí pero con un new customer.
they think I'm a new customer.
so I have to spend fifty bucks.
which is not bad.
eso lo tenía que hacer yo because is through my
you know.
right.
pero en que que en caso que alguien
porque Patrick me dijo que él no sabía que tipo ordering.
y Hannah también.
so that's a couple of people.
and we can just do it through my.
you know.
porque veinticinco dólares son veinticinco dólares.
eh?
I'll look at it.
and I probably can see it.
but I don't like.
twenty bucks?
fourteen bucks?
no era tan cara.
era esa.
estoy casi segura de que era esa.
esa misma es.
no esa no es.
no esa no es.
no tienen opción de blanco?
they have a nice colour.
I don't think I.
I don't remember how much I spent.
yo creo que era de veinte pesos.
era la de veinte pesos.
right.
era esa.
the pink.
y light blue forget it.
I don't think so.
qué es la que está rebajada?
esa no está mal.
no está la navy.
stone.
y light blue.
so uh the book is is like you've read the book you don't wanna watch the movie.
like the end.
but I like the movie.
but if you when you when you read the boo you don't wanna you you say wha why they they don't do tha in the movie you know.
yeah.
and at the end they put they put like ah como una inyección.
se la ponen and like.
él podía escoger o una inyección o unas pastillas tomarse unas pastillas o salir pa la calle y fajarse contra todo el mundo.
he was like like a murder.
for them it wa he was like a murder.
a murder?
yeah como un asesino porque ya ellos tenían su comun comunidad ahí.
yeah.
you know.
they were like living like normal.
yeah but they're crazy they kill people like.
no they don't kill people.
they don't kill.
ellos no mataban a su propia gente.
ellos mataban a la gente como nosotros.
pero exactly that's killing people.
because there were still some survivors left.
you know but
I don't know.
I know they they adapted.
adaptaron a a la vida de ellos.
yeah.
I got it.
I wanna see it I wanna see it.
have you see the the first one?
the one that the one that came on the on the movie on the movie theater.
the movie yeah yeah.
I wanna buy it.
the special edition is the one that comes with the.
yeah.
it's like twenty something twenty something bucks.
I wanna see it.
so yeah.
and.
a in the in the in the book.
hmm.
he drink the pills.
ah i's like like you know como que te enfocan que se se fue como que se va yendo así you know.
but in the book there is a girl that betrayed him que se hace pasar por humano.
y no es humano.
es de los los demás tipos.
oh really?
yeah.
oh but.
that's the that's the cool part that they don't show you in the in the in the movie.
yeah but they can't do that in the movie.
why?
because all all the monsters look like they look like zombies.
yeah.
and the other people look like normal people.
so like there's no way que ella se puede pasar como humano si se parece como un zombie.
pero ella se estaba curando en la película ella se estaba curando.
remember he had that girl on the bed?
that one that one se estaba curando.
on the second ending they show you like the girl is is like curing is like healthing um:.
cuando se la va a entregar le da un shot y se convierte de nuevo.
dude y you you saw that the the the girl was breathing like like a lo.
yeah.
ella después en el final estaba como más pasiva.
y le da al el tipo le da un shot de de otra no sé qué de la que tenía él.
y y se pone monstruo de nuevo.
yeah.
entonces they close the door and that's it.
damn.
but.
I wanna see it.
look at that look at that over there.
yeah.
oh my god bro.
so none of none of none of the endings is is like relative to to the movie to the book.
right.
yeah I heard that there's there's a different there's different versions of the movie and the book.
there's a old movie like I Am Legend is a remake.
yeah it's like they they got like three movies.
yeah.
but I don't know why they why they can't do the movie by the book.
they already they already got the book.
sometimes they gotta change stuff you know.
sometimes it it can't all be the same.
ah.

porque el maje siempre me decía pues que me amaba y que no sé cuanto.
y después cortamos en noviembre.

y me dijo como que.
hoy te amo más que nunca.
me dice.

y supuestamente me decía que me amaba cuando en realidad te amaba a vos.
las decepciones.
pero ah.
un huevo loco entonces es como que más decepcionante.

y lo sigo estando loco sigo estando enamorado porque uno no se deja de enamorar de la noche a la mañana.
pero pero que me diga eso bróder puta me me me duele en puta loco me duele muchísimo muchísimo.
o sea me me hiere como persona me entendés.
pobrecito.
me siento o sea me siento super ahuevado loco porque
no sé me en o sea a al principio cuando cortamos cuando recién cortamos pues yo le dije al maje como que.
todavía me amás?
le digo.
me dice.
no ya no te amo.
me dice.
pero pero sí te quiero.
y entonces yo me quedé.
ah?
entonces yo me quedé pensando como que.
a la gran puta.
decía yo.
qué rápido dejó de amarme.
dije yo.
y y o sea me me empecé a sentir super mal porque porque dije.
a la gran a la gran puta qué qué fácil que es olvidarme a mí.

y dejarme de amar.
decía yo.
y entonces se lo dije al maje hoy o ayer no me acuerdo.
le dije como que.

le digo.
voy a ser honesto con vos.
y y me siento mal.
le digo.
de que o sea me hace sentir mal el hecho de que me has dejado de amar tan rápido que no sé qué y que no sé cuánto.
le digo.
y y y y puta le digo.
me haces sentir como que soy una persona tan fácil de olvidar.
le digo.
una persona tan tan like que que se supera se supera así de fácil.
le digo.
entonces me dice.
no.
me dice.
que no es eso sino que nunca te llegué a amar.
me dice.
qué cerrote maje.
loco y que me lo diga con esa frialdad me entendés.
o sea es que.
frío frío.
sí y sabés qué el maje ahora está viviendo con Pedro.
cómo?

qué andan jalando?
no no cállate.
o sea al principio el plan era como que nos íbamos a ir a porque yo me iba a regresar a Nicaragua a vivir.
entonces nos íbamos a ir a vivir los tres juntos.
así como roommates me entendés para que like saliera cheaper me entendés.
saliera más barato alquilar un lugar.
mmhm.
y entonces como que yo les dije.
vayan adelantando ustedes pues vayan pasándose y eso.
y like a los majes les gustó la idea pues.
y entonces like los majes están viviendo juntos pues ahora.
y ya ya son roommates y eso.
y y no sé loco.
ayer ayer me peleé con Pedro por Victor y
y por qué se pelearon?
porque sí porque el el maje de Pedro me empezó a decir como que Victor le empezó a contar pues de que le gusta un maje ahí que no sé qué.
y entonces yo como que.
contame contame.
y el maje me decía no que no sé qué no puedo contarte que no sé cuanto.
y yo.

o sea porque Pedro y yo nos contamos absolutamente todo like absolutely everything me entendés?
like cada detalle incluso our sex lives me entendés nuestras vidas sexuales.
hablábamos como que nos contábamos detalles me entendés.
y le preguntaba como que.
y te la metió?
y se la metiste?
cosas así me entendés.
sí.
y entonces y nos contábamos así vale verga me entendés.
y entonces el maje.

entonces siento como que el maje ahora se está volvi se va a volver íntimo de de de de mi ex loco.
y y yo me voy a quedar mordiendo el leño loco.
y entonces le dije como que.

le digo.
no me digas nada.

no me digas.
le digo.
entonces me dice.
ah no yo.
me dice.

le digo.
no seas por la verga.
le digo yo.

porque el maje me empezó a decir cosas como que olvidá a Víctor ya me dice olvidálo ya.
ya este
ya no es.
yo no le.
sinceramente.
me dice.
yo a ustedes no les veo un futuro ni lejano ni cercano.
me dice.
olvidálo que no sé cuanto.
entonces yo le decía.
pero por qué?
le digo.
like si me lo estás diciendo i i it's for a reason.
le digo.
si me estás diciendo que lo olvide.
le digo.
es por algo.
entonces me.
hasta o sea le tuve que que decir y decir y y hasta que lo convencí que me contara.
y yo nunca había tenido que convencer a Julio para que me contara algo.
like él me contaba las cosas right away me entendés.
entonces.
pero es que mirá maje es que es su roommate se siente con pena tal vez.
no no no no no I understand me entendés porque me lo dijo.
o sea el maje me dice.
no le digas nada.
no le digas nada.
me dice.
porque es que porque si le decís.
me dice.
y vos sabés ahora estoy viviendo con él.
me dice.
y no quiero crear conflictos entre nosotros.
and I understand that me entendés?
pero pero o sea yo le dije como que.
no no te preocupés.
no le voy a decir.
like Pedro sabe de que cuando nosotros nos decimos no digas nada nosotros no decimos nada me entendés.
o sea y que me lo haya dicho así tantas veces.
pero no le digas nada cuidadito le vas a decir que no sé qué.
o sea me hizo sentir tan tan tan mal like he didn't trust me any more me entendés.
me me hi me hi me hizo sentir bien por la verga loco.
entonces lo bloqueé.
y no sé me siento como resentido con él loco.
no hombre.

oh.
eh Sean wants to have a meeting at A One con todavía tienen problemas con la torre de la televisión.
and he would like for you to be an attendance with N D R which is a subcontractor for the tower and Mario wich is the W R N guy.
so that they cannot be on the same page.
porque uno dice una cosa el otro dice otra and apparently it's been.
we are just mincing by standards but.
eh next tuesday a las nueve o las diez.
qué hora prefieres?
ok um.
next friday.
hablando de next friday.
you get my email about taking advantage that it's a teacher planning day?
to do do punch list for for the schools?
en el dieciocho de de enero it's teacher planning day.
so there are no kids.
right.
ok well I might call him up.
but I don't think you need to be there but he does.
if he doesn't.
right.
right.
ok ok ok.
but I did send you an email couple of days ago that friday January the eighteenth is a teacher planning day so it'd be a good day to do all the schools if you wanna get them over way.
porque no hay niños no hay nadie.
right.
I'd rather not do Monday which is legal holiday because then you gotta pay them but.
oh you guys call you gonna call you guys call them.
coño?
pero ustedes son blanquitos.
qué hacen ustedes dando ese día?
h verdad verdad verdad.
so sorry so sorry.
right y sí.
A es cuestión de check it through that everything is ok.
because we are trying to get closer.
right you've done punch list right.
now did you do punch list for you?
did you send them to Ana?
you send them to me yesterday.
ok perfect.
ok no problem.
I just didn't find them in the server so I wanted to make sure with the.
and the next eh didn't have it so that's why I wanted to.
so it's just a matter of checking.
I would U last simply because that's the last when we finished.
you know I'm saying?
because A ya llevan ahí ocupados.
like three or four months.
B lo mismo.
they are occupied two thirds of the facilities for a month so I would do U as the last one.
you know.
si two two guys are wanna do offering one day fine.
you know.
we can do U one a different day because they still have work to do.
so you know.
to me there's.
it's not that there's no hurry.
they just haven't had time to do the stuff.
y para qué vas a ir para que después digan.
chico no hiciste esto esto y esto y esto.
you know.
right but I but I least for A and B you know ninety percent of the staff.
A should all be done.
and at B most of it should be done because they've been doing a lot.
so okey dokey?
thank you much!
bye.
so we forwarded the M E P to U One?
he said he sended to you yesterday.
Craig said he did not have it.
just forward it.
because according to that email I got from them they have not received an M E P.
but it was not on our system.
no.
I looked under U One punch list with architecture and N D C P S.
there was no there was no S D N.
under architecture.
where's the S D Ns?
where?
under punch list?
and you want?
I'm in there.
there's nothing in there.
I need U.
I don't need B.
I need U.
we have nothing for U.
go in there an U and tell me where there is the D M R.
porque no está nada.
that's what I.
he said he sended again yesterday.
but I don't know that they have been to U.
listo.
tell them that we need new.
I don't think he has been to U.
now if he hasn't been to U
I know this is who says first watches out second.
you know.
I don't think he's been to U.
if he hasn't been to.
I think he is confused.
llámalo.
he needs to go to U.
he has not been to U.
y si no ha.
so ok then he needs to.
yes.
there's no one.
yes.
hang on.
I'll call you right back.
but mechanical and electrical can.
we need U.
somebody was telling me there's a movie.
forty forty eight hours.
like the one that was filmed here.
and what's your name?
you!
I hear a movie they were telling me yesterday.
what's your name?
no you!
no you!
what's your name?
you!
I was to listen to whatever you said.
what did you say?
hi Martha.
this is Maria.
how are you?
I got ahold of Tom.
and for the Double U L R meeting.
he said unfortunately he's work every morning on next week until Friday.
but he felt bad.
as long as I was there and knew when N D are if you don't wanna wait.
you know.
because he's got meetings already scheduled.
and then we wanna resolve that so.
up to you.
right right.
you said that ah next Tuesday the fifteenth either nine or ten.
you just tell me what time.
either is fine with me.
I don't I don't have problems with.
you said ah Tuesday the fifteenth?
yes next Tuesday.
either at nine or at ten.
right right right right.
not a problem.
nine it is.
right.
at nine a m and then I will wherever
you know.
we need to
he said we can call him at cell or something but he has meetings all next week.
he says.
you are not gonna leave it but I will work until friday.
it's like oh my god.
okey dokey.
all right.
thanks fine.
qué te dijo?
you were like.
it's in the server.
I'm like.
it is not.
I'm looking at the server.
you looked and it was already in the system of course.
but did you tell him que Craig dijo that they are already been altered verdad?
that's right.
they.
on the eighteen it's a teacher plannig day so we should.
eh la el viernes de la semana que viene.
next Friday.
there'll be no children.
we should plan to go to A and B at least to review all our punch list to make sure.
porque the teacher should be there.
the teachers are there.
there's no kids so we podemos entrar y salir de todos los cuartos sin ningún problema.
uh Monday is a legal holiday.
I'd rather not use it unless we want to because they have to get paid overtime.
but that thing that would only be at U One.
at A I think we should do A first pa ya acabar con A.
check if it's done it's not done whatever it is.
then we go to B and then
to me U should be the last one simply because they just finished!
so they are not going to have time to have finish it.
right and that's what I and that's what I told Tom and said I would.
you know.
let's do A first.
if we can do B that would be great so we can finish those two uh.
and then it's just a matter of waiting when they are ready for you because the are not going to be ready for us to review U One because they haven't done anything.
you are trying to get the damm building get a water with it on.
no preguntes.
they just run the bacterials and like.
I asked Peter.
aren't you supposed to have bacterial test before?
I did neither.
I did.
well somehow they some.
that's.
right.
right.
that's what Martha told me.
right right.
and the bacterials have a limited time.
they only have thirty days.
no it's thirty days.
thirty days.
the bacterial test is only the result is only good for thirty days.
so if you haven't gone but they have H R S approval which is the part that there's a little confusing.
because they wouldn't be able to cook if they haven't H R S approval.
or maybe until they run.
somebody is a blind eye.
no the H R S is health eh department.
H R S is health department.
that's the big one.
oh so H R S hasn't because a water with steel it's not legal.
oh so there are satelliting in it.
it's called satelliting in.
they took on on Monday.
maybe it was Tuesday.
maybe it was Tuesday.
because Bob sent an email saying Dan Beale said that they hadn't been there.
and they were testing it.
and that's when I forwarded that information to E A C and I said.
I'm confused.
school is open.
and now you are running bacterials?
and he's like.
he was confused too.
he was confused too.
apparently.
it's a package that goes a document control.
I think we need to create.
take our drawings make a new one as cold fish and get rid of everything but the fish number.
and I guess furniture.
we've we did for we did it for simply cause they didn't give us the numbers but it was turned out convenient because then we already have the drawing.
the drawing already had existed.
ask him about that because that is just a matter of.
change it above.
well you could actually make a new one because the blog it's an extra.
the tag numbers are an extra.
you just edit the blog.
you make a new drawing add it the blog and all become little fishies.
ask him ask him.
she didn't tell me whatever it is and I wasn't supposed to listen to.
now I want to know!
now you got me curious.
I said curious.
I'm gonna do it.
there you go.
nothing relating the flooring.
um.
good.
no we'll come set.
I'm gonna try the library rather than Bibles.
I don't know any place to store the blogs.
that's my dilemma!
you you've been to my house.
you haven't seen the book store in the garage that I have no place to put!
I walked out the other day and when.
I walked the.
I don't care about architectural.
no.
I.
hello I have two little ones.
I'm getting riding of no books.
Judy Blume.
no actually actually yeah I I just keep them for Danny.
there went our family we are much about recycling.
there went to my nephew.
they came back from my nephew.
now they are going to Max and James.
when Danny grows up the one who is reading now because he is much older.
they all go to
my sister.
my nephew is twenty four.
I said.
it's a good material.
it's a good product.
why should I buy a new one?
sixteenth of what.
the sixth of January was a Sunday.
that's where your D J it's.
the two piece set of the water glasses is
can you do me a favor?
what?
go to Paypal.
because I think that's a little bit more important right now than looking at some dollar store online.
you know how to log in?
you do it.
give me the computer.
ok.
because this guy wanted to buy the headlights.
and he he said he was going to send the money in today.
so if he does that's my to call him.
at hot female dot com.
oh yeah it's a little gay that um that it's at Hotmail dot com not Hotfemale dot com.
ay ya.
I'm gonna I'm gonna Hotfemale dot com.
then I'll be diez mil en Hotfemale dot com instead of at
eh eh eh.
I bet it exists right.
then let's make an account.
don't you think that's funny?
is that that French teacher's artwork?
is it?
I think so.
I saw another one of his on the wall the other day in the other side of the library.
I see.
but why the hell does he put the fricking
and the ornaments.
why does he have the periodic table on?
I don't know.
that's ridiculous.
ok no that he he didn't send the money.
so I thought he wanted it today.
check my email for me?
let's see if he wrote to me or something.
you know Matt has actually asked me about the fish.
what did he say?
well he asked me.
how are your fish doing?
and I told him that the puffer fish had died and
although that was a while back right.
he hadn't asked me you know.
yeah I know.
and he said.
oh well there aren't those you you know brackish water?
so he didn't the other guy had told him.
and then I told him about the box fish that we got.
what did he say?
that not to eat it!
he said that those are the the they have poisonous swim bladder.
oh uh we weren't gonna eat it.
you wanted to sell it.
yeah well but
ok.
I don't think you're
your book has shipped.
what?
you like colon cleanse.
detoxify your body.
no I don't want that.
ok delete all of them except the ones from six gen maxima the ones from two books for you.
baby so delete the other ones.
don't do that.
put delete all.
oh oh oh right right.
uh that's what I was planning.
then take them out.
don't make fun of me.
and then that one again.
and the Amazon Marketplace purchase no you gotta delete that.
delete so everything else just leave those three things?
yeah.
right let me see the one for the two books.
what's your tracking number?
I don't think I got a tracking number.
because I paid for the cheapest filling eh shipping.
who cares?
ok.
so put it to save.
no put it on the school.
put it um move to move to school.
um.
to F I U.
right here move to F I U.
alright and then check the other ones for me.
just click on it.
ok.
now someone show me
how we're fixing please.
I will do this good.
because I have no way of.
I'm not gonna.
where's the home?
er it's a different person.
it's a different guy asking.
ok because I said.
close it.
cause I somebody asking about how to wire the foglights in the car so that they come on on their own.
delete it?
yep.
falta uno.
yeah clear them out.
cause Jared Jared says
maybe he doesn't know.
because maybe he just pays for everything.
maybe he doesn't know.
but he says that his installer guy got the windows to go up and down with the rem with the alarm.
I'm thinking that the the installer just charged them for the for the modules.
so maybe they'll go up and down.
and he doesn't know.
what he's saying that it's without putting the the modules.
I think that he's wrong.
because.
hey oh on the
yeah the because the thing is if if they have one.
but but they charge him a hell of a lot of money.
so it the he it probably is included in the price.
alright.
ok.
he
he had to put it in this thing right?
I can do it.
I can do it with this ones too.
so that means that there's a little connection that lets me do it with this key.
you wanna rewire or.
ok he says that the guy moved the connection from this receiver to this receiver.
ok.
how the hell can you move it from one receiver to the other?
because there's a receiver in the car that receives signals from this remote.
and then it turn it it makes the the the motors on the on the windows go down.
he just unplugged that from that receiver.
and plugged it into the auxiliary receiver on the on the module for this one.
because I can plug in whatever I want to it.
mmhm.
the point is I need to find the cables I want to plug in.
and plug it in to this thing ok?
that's what he said the guy did.
everybody's like.
oh I don't know how to do this!
impossible.
it's difficult.
not impossible that's doable.
you know what you do is you buy the modules fifty bucks each.
and they let you control.
and then add it onto this.
but then I would have to like run wires through each door.
and so it's a pain in the ass to install too.
besides the fact that it's you know the fifty bucks each.
then installation is even more.
so it's it's gonna be two hundred bucks?
it's only let me see.
ok let me go down.
I thought they were going to keep windows.
I didn't know you could roll them back up.
mine doesn't roll them back up!
but I don't know if somebody says so.
didn't Jared say he could do that too?
yeah that's what I'm saying.
I didn't think he'd put a module.
because I can't put it up and down.
and the car just goes on.
and you know what I noticed?
if I had the car
yeah?
on it won't work any more.
the car has to be off for it to come now.
ok.
I guess it's not designed to work without a start with a remote start.
do you want to delete that.
and then see what's in my junk.
you need to see my junk.
ok just delete it.
yeah click on the arrow next to the junk too.
there we go.
isn't that just intuitive the arrow?
whatever no mine is better.
ok you can log me out.
good girl.
go to hell bitch.
why?
let's go to Wales.
no.
do you think they have lots of whales in Wales?
you're the corniest person in the entire fricking
oh I I I'm gonna ask him when he gets back.
because I think it's funny.
I think it's a funny name to call a country Wales.
what language do they speak over there?
see if you know.
Welsh?
no English.
no.
Flemish I think it is.
ok baby.
I think it's Flemish.
ok darling.
you know how many languages they got there?
hello?
is this another Family Guy reference?
no that's from Finding Nemo.
what she was speaking.
does that sound a little orca to you?
oh my god.
ok.
I went to all the websites today.
I had so much I wanted to show you.
yeah you did everything except what you were supposed to do.
I know.
well I'm disappointed in you.
as usual.
and now the people in Wales are going to find out that I'm disappointed on my fiancé.
ah.
and they're gonna think that the students from from F I U are not good students.
ya.
córtala.
well he he said to keep talking.
but it doesn't say anywhere that we can't adjust the microphones.
oh my god.
anyways.
you're so annoying sometimes.
um.
oh yeah.
I feel the same way you do about me
oh if we go over five thirty.
oh oh she emailed me back.
the lady from Flamingo Gardens.
and what did she say?
she said that we can have more than a hundred guests.
but we're gonna have to pay for their chairs.
like bring in the chairs from an outside rental.
so that was the only reason why they said me a maximum of a hundred for the for the fricking chairs?
yeah because they only had a hundred chairs!
oh come on!
that's not our problem.
uh you what?
I'm just gonna leave the hundred chairs.
and the kids can sit on their parents laps.
or you know do whatever the hell.
oh and um they don't close down the the park if you have a wedding.
they it's uh still open to the public.
I don't like that.
I don't like that either.
and if you're in the wedding party you can't go you can't go roam around the park and look at things.
unless you pay?
unless you pay the twelve bucks.
oh it makes sense.
because you're going for free but
well I'm paying like two thousand bucks.
so then we can't as a wedding party go together looking at things unless we all pay?
no.
unless everyone pays.
that's another dozen hundred dollars.
she said that she said that you can get the fifteen or more group discount.
and it'll cost you less money.
that's so ridiculous over that amount of people.
hey that's why she said twelve I think instead of
yeah but I I
because with the group discount you get like twelve dollars for adults.
versus seventeen it's a huge difference.
it's over a hundred dollars less.
but I don't wanna pay twelve hundred dollars for people to go look at birds.
in my wedding yeah it's our wedding day.
they gonna look at us.
no no no I mean if they wanna walk around they can go on their own.
and pay?
I'm not gonna yeah.
well anyways I just
maybe because the last time we went it was right after the Eragon.
and it was all messed up.
but I really.
I think by now it should be fixed.
we need to go back and see.
look how pretty the gazebo looks.
did you see it?
the gays bo?
oh my god.
they're gonna be like.
what the hell are you talking about?
ah gays bo look it up!
mmhm it's from the teacher reference.
ignore him.
ok so Flamingo Gardens.
why are you talking to your shirt?
I
because I don't want them to think you're crazy or something.
you're so adorable.
love you.
you know?
what the fuck?
you know baby don't say bad words.
temper temper mister mister N W A.
oh my god shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna walk away I swear.
hello temper temper.
you want me to walk away?
hey you keep using bad words.
córtalo.
no.
sí.
no.
anyways remember Rebecca?
no.
that little girlfriend of mine from Birmingham?
from England?
ok.
that online girlfriend of mine?
I think she either visited Wales or she spoke
I'm just thinking baby.
comes to mind now.
me está dando ya un dolor de cabeza.
why can't that come to mind now?
we were just talking to this guy from Wales.
and that maybe reminded me of her.
no te oigo.
I've put it I typed it in right?
I wonder if she settled?
and it didn't go to the website.
I wonder what ever happened to her.
why don't you go email her.
see what she says.
because I
she says she'll miss me.
well I don't have her
ha that's awesome.
I don't have her email.
I don't think I saved it unfortunately.
you know what I been trying really really hard to find?
what?
that video.
no lo de
that's all I was saying that video.
I been trying to find it so badly.
yeah well I don't want you to.
I downloaded Kazaa.
uh Kazaa Lite.
and there's another one now.
Kazaa Lite Resurrection.
because they had Kazaa right?
ok.
other one?
listen it's a really cool thing.
it's Kazaa right which I used to use.
it was free.
uhhuh baby.
then they wanted to make money.
so they started putting ads and stuff on it right.
and then they're like.
good now you have to pay to use it.
so people stopped using it.
yeah.
well before they they make made you pay to use it while it was with the ads and all that stuff they come out with Kazaa Lite.
some guy just hacked it and took out all the
yeah.
two thousand five they closed down the network.
because I think they got sued by the real wow.
they got
I said sued!
because of the whole Kazaa Kazaa.
they got they got sued.
they got sued by the Kazaa.
the website's not working.
Flamingo Gardens is you sure it's dot org not dot com dot com?
and in two thousand five they stopped going on right?
it's dot org.
it's.
that's too cute.
the ladybug.
don't that look scary as hell?
there you go ok look.
under weddings.
and some guy resurrected it.
and now it's called Kazaa Lite Resurrection.
oh my god.
they brought it back.
who knows how many things you downloaded into your computer.
no actually it says when you click on it it says.
Kazaa Lite has always been free.
and if you paid for this you just been scammed.
and no it doesn't have any spyware.
it doesn't have anything.
it it's like it says.
it's this is our number one thing.
and it's very popular.
look how beautiful the gazebo is for the ceremony.
it's a nice gazebo.
but
oh my god stop saying
wait ok.
but what will happen in there?
just you and me and the and the priest?
uhhuh.
and the officiant or whatever?
that's it.
that's the three of us and then.
and everybody else is somewhere outside?
uhhuh.
where from outside around it or in front of it?
in front.
so a lot of people are not gonna see because of the of the wood.
no it has a little it has a little entrance.
right?
and then you have the seats would be in front of it.
mira.
where's the pen?
baby I'm just saying.
if we're all the way back here would.
we're not gonna be all the way back there.
let me ask me my question.
that's that's that's contorted babe.
ok.
well I never gotten married in case you can't tell!
I mean if you haven't figured it out by now it's my first time getting married sweetheart.
I mean wow yeah.
oh my god.
ok so this is the gazebo
so when is it that that the dog ate the the Roger's dog ate the the parrot?
they they didn't mean Jim right?
no they meant ok.
they had this like neighbour who went out of town.
uhhuh.
and she left their her her parrot.
in a cage or something like just
in yeah in her in her cage in the back yard.
like under their care.
uhhuh.
and mom said that she was outside the not this like this past week the the week before.
mmhm.
and the dog kept on jumping up on the cage jumping up on the cage and after the parrot.
my mom got was trying my mom was getting annoyed right.
I mean first of all she hates the dog.
everyone hates the dog.
except for Roger.
because
but what's wrong with the dog?
the dog looks so friendly so happy.
have you stepped outside?
with that dog there?
no but every time we come he's like jumping trying to play with us.
he jumps up to your fricking face!
nice!
he could be a basketball player!
and he he attacks.
he he he's too he's too.
how are you gonna tell me he attacks?
he's he's he's like laughing and wagging the little stub for a tail that he has.
yeah he he's having fun when he kills little animals and shit.
oh.
he's not a nice dog.
Roger has him trained for hunting.
yeah but but you can train him for hunting and be nice to people.
hunting animals not people.
yeah well they haven't socialised him.
because the girls are scared of him.
he doesn't get along with other dogs.
he's just a little menace.
like Dennis?
oh my god ok.
I did not like that movie you know.
it's it's based on a cartoon strip in a cartoon show.
Dennis the Menace.
it's better as a cartoon strip on a cartoon show.
ok well
my mom went outside.
and she sees the dog jumping on the thing.
and trying to get to the parrot right?
and mom says she grabbed him by the neck choked him and started like you know trying to.
the dog?
yeah!
your mother?
yes.
isn't the dog bigger than your mother?
no it's a little um.
go on your mother I find it hilarious.
that wasn't funny.
ok so she was choking the fricking dog.
ok so we talking about the midget dog not Bo.
not the big dog.
no it's not Bo.
it's the the little white one.
because they had too many animals right.
I don't know what the hell it is.
a little terrier or
no it's not a terrier.
it's a it's it's an English dog actually.
isn't that cool?
ok god.
it is!
no it is.
ya.
he said that it was.
ok.
uhhuh.
my mom was choking.
my mom says that dog is a freak of nature.
because she was choking and choking and choking it nothing.
the thing is that he would just keep on going like it's all good.
so you had the the the
she got the manguera.
but she had.
started hitting him.
, he had already eaten the the thing?
no he was trying to.
she was trying
oh.
my mom got the manguera.
started hitting him with the manguera.
nothing.
he just kept on going at th at the cage like it was all good nothing.
hmm.
he doesn't feel a thing.
but.
and then
why is your mother torturing this very expensive dog that her employers own?
because it was trying to eat the parrot.
yeah but it's not
and it turns out that he ate the parrot.
but it's not your mother's responsibility to protect the parrot.
yet is her her responsibility to not hurt the dog which cost a thousand something dollars.
and it's Roger's prize possession right now.
my mom my mom was saying that she wishes that the dog would just die.
which she's gonna get fired.
because it's.
that dog is not gonna die.
unless Roger shoots him or something.
Lassie let's go now outside.
um.
the the my mom said that they had to take him to the vet.
and like they put like the the they give him I guess an enema.
why?
and pumped his stomach.
why?
because of the bones of the parrot inside of him.
so what is Roger gonna do?
buy a new parrot?
I guess!
and and hope that she doesn't realise.
no he's gonna have to tell her.
why it's a fricking parrot.
my killer dog ate your parrot.
it's a parrot up it's a parrot it's a parrot.
no but that that cage was huge.
and it was a strong cage.
the dog knocked the cage over.
so what?
and the thing opened?
and the parrot came out?
and the dog ate the parrot.
so then he wasn't that that that strong if just
no no no no because the thing is it's
ok it's like the two part ones where you have the base.
and then you have I guess a a cage on top which is um in I guess in the shape of a canopy.
yeah no on the bottom it's open.
so if you knock it off uhhuh.
ah it's a stupid piece of crap then.
so the the dog knocked it over.
and the parrot was not too bright.
those parrots have their wings clipped most of the time.
oh that's right they can't fly.
yeah they can't fly.
I was gonna say they can't swim!
they flew they they would've gone.
well that sucks.
yeah.
you know what I was thinking?
my mom says that Jock is probably next.
my mom says that she no she said that she wishes that he would eat Jock.
because if he eats Jock they'll get rid of the dog.
no but no.
cause they're they all attached to Jock.
come on that's a beautiful freaking macaw man.
they shouldn't let him.
he should go.
you know you tell Roger he buys me a pellet gun and I I'll shoot his dog.
I'll do the dirty job.
he's not gonna get rid of it.
he loves the dog.
or he gives me his Mercedes and I'll run the dog over with his own car.
so what do you think of the the gazebo?
I don't even remember it.
uh it's not a bad looking gazebo but
oh my god stop calling it that.
ah I gotta exploit Michael.
ok.
so yeah and then they have the rates yeah.
if they can do the gazebo.
and then the garden area.
it says.
for use during ceremonies.
that's what I wanted to use for the actual reception.
I don't wanna use the barbecue pavilion.
that's like retarded.
after five thirty it pays seventy five dollars an hour?
hmm?
so then that means we're gonna be done before five thirty with our wedding?
our ceremony and everything?
hopefully if you want to.
if not no.
well well were you were you planning on paying extra per hour then?
no I was planning on being done by then.
so but what happened to the whole sunset and all that stuff?
costs too much money.
wait from five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty it'll be like three hundred bucks.
eight thirty for what babe?
the sunset goes on around eight.
no get it.
when are we getting married?
when are we getting married?
in
daylight savings time or not?
oh my god yeah.
it'll be like I wanna do it like February or March.
so we'll may be able to like just have to pay one hour extra.
that's true.
and these people don't have anything about you can't use you know candles or you can't use you know uh the little sparklers.
so you can do the sparkler thing.
can we throw rice?
no you can't.
it's a bird park you get it?
it's funny.
yes it's a sanctuary yeah.
so I'm sure rice is off limits.
the only thing that they they they have that they specifically say no to is the is the alcohol.
well goo we we I'm sure if we just pass out drugs then people won't complain about not having alcohol.
did they mention anything about drugs?
no Luke.
ok so we can have drugs then!
that's how we do it down here.
so what do you think of Flamingo Garden?
I I don't know.
we'll have to see it again because I just
which is why
I think we should go with our families.
no babe for that we can just just you and me.
it counts for my class.
it counts.
I still don't see why we have to bring another twenty five people.
I would like my parents to go.
because they have never been to that park.
and it's really lovely.
yeah that's a whole different story.
but it has nothing to do with me seeing it to consider whether or not I want it to be a venue for my wedding.
yeah but we can kill two birds with one stone.
and spend some time with the family.
baby!
ok that is messed up.
and go look
we're going to a bird sanctuary to kill two birds with one stone!
shut the fuck up.
yeah oh now I remember what I was going to ask you.
do you think when they are listening to these recordings that they're going to listen to both of us at the same time?
or is it just me just talking one crap and you're talking a completely different crap individually?
unless they put it together it doesn't really make much sense does it?
think about it.
think about it!
if it's just you saying every so often.
ay Jesu Cristo.
shut the fuck up shut the fuck
yeah half a page of shut the fuck up.
every so often.
all on your own.
without any input from me it sounds kind of weird.
we don't need wedding counselling right or marriage counselling?
no babe not yet we're not married yet.
we're perfectly fine.
we're not married yet.
that's one of the suggestions on one of those websites to get counselling before you're married.
before?
yeah.
like if necessary.
we should get a pre nup.
I'm like what the fuck if you're getting married you shouldn't be needing counselling.
we should get a pre nup.
we're not getting a pre nup.
yes we are.
that's absurd.
why babe?
I wanna make sure when you leave me that I get ninety per cent of your money.
we'll make it that if you're the one who makes it
uh oh yeah ninety per cent of zero.
what is that?
if you if no baby because you're gonna make it big.
if you make it big I get ninety per cent of your earnings.
oh really.
make it big in what?
in history?
sure maybe you'll be the one to discover the you know Jesus.
stop no don't do that!
why?
sorry.
maybe you.
put it away.
it scares me.
maybe you'll be the one to discover Jesus.
we could save so much money if we only had twenty guests.
I know.
my mom your mom
the ceremony for up to twenty guests two hundred and fifty dollars that's it.
I I ha I have to email them about the reception if we can meet them in the garden area in front.
Ray Home verandah.
you know what we should do it in?
wait wait if this the Ray Home verandah says canopy of live oak surrounding the historic home.
so would that imply that the that the thing would be outside the reception?
ok that that sounds good.
yeah babe but I don't think I don't think we're gonna fit a bunch of people in there.
that's a home.
it's a house.
no no no because I wanted outdoor.
remember the whole tea thing I wanted to be outdoors.
not indoors.
yeah.
I'm just thinking all those birds and all those trees and a lot of pooping on our heads.
we're gonna have tents?
I don't think we'll need it.
if they ok I'll wear a white tuxedo there you go.
because if they poop on my.
you're not wearing a tuxedo.
I'm not?
I don't want you to.
I want it to be really casual.
all right.
so like I was thinking a nice
guayabera?
I dunno a tan suit or something like the tan
yo quiero Taco Bell.
with a ni a the pink shirt or something really relaxed.
now I'm making all these and these concessions right.
uh.
what concession do I have to make?
take it seriously.
I am.
I'm taking it.
no because of the whole religion thing.
oh yeah no baby exactly.
but that's why we're not doing it by the church.
yeah but we're still having my uncle who's a pastor.
who is gonna marry us.
ok well make sure you tell him not to do all of that crazy you know voodoo Bible stuff.
they don't he do the the Christian church doesn't do the whole you know use the blood of Christ and all that crap he's
I don't want any reading from the Bible.
I don't.
I do want some.
and
you said Corinthians only.
well
that's it.
that's all I conceded to.
because it's romantic.
I don't want anything to do with.
God brought you here and God
because I don't believe in that.
and so how am I.
well you know what I I I need a little bit of of if he if he asks for a little bit of liberty in that for you to respect it.
and well I suppose he's also gonna do it in Spanish?
I don't know.
uh well considering.
is the whole were you planning on the whole wedding being in Spanish and not telling me until the day of?
the the the invitations so far as I have imagined them are in English.
but then I was thinking everyone in the fucking family speaks Spanish.
what the fuck are we gonna do?
are we gonna send everyone who speaks Spanish an English invitation?
well babe here's the thing.
they're in America.
they need to get with the fricking program.
I am not going to do.
Luke!
I am not going to do two language invitations.
because then you're paying two different companies to do
no pero doing it in Spanish
no because there's some people like
who?
Jessie and and and and Davy.
who got my fifteenth invitation in Spanish and knew how to get there.
you know if the the directions are in are in numbers.
I mean it's not like you know uno dos tres cuatro.
you know oh.
no.
does she mean one two three four?
oh my god.
are you gonna wri well maybe because some of them they actually write the fricking numbers out.
put the numbers in numbers.
how about that?
amore.
en números.
no because I seen some of them that you know they write out the numbers.
you know I I don't wanna do I didn't wanna do it in Spanish.
but it it makes more sense.
being it's more it's more sensitive to our family situation.
but then again are we doing this for.
because I wanted to do that introduction on the top.
are we gonna do this for our family or for us?
well obviously it's not for us!
are you and I getting married?
or is the family getting a party thrown?
I mean are we throwing a party for the fricking family or for you and me?
you know I don't wanna do it in Spanish.
because I don't just don't like it.
you like to say te amo.
that's pretty much the only thing I'll con I I'll I'll give.
just because you see it as special.
I say I love you.
and I mean it as passionately as you as you mean te amo.
it doesn't have the same connotation you know.
te amo.
te quiero.
but but I don't I don't wanna do
this is the gazebo thing.
look the layout.
en en como es en pobreza y en en en.
no no no no but ok I'm not gonna
the vows are something personal.
no one else it doesn't matter if the whole fucking ceremony is in English.
uh stop with the bad words.
sorry I'm I'm I'm gone somewhere.
they're gonna go assuming that all they teach us here is fricking bad words.
because you said that nasty word which I don't say.
oh you little
mira.
you said it several times already.
and it's just it's inappropriate for a for a petite little lady like yourself.
ok sweetheart.
thank you.
it's uncouth.
and you are so refined.
ok.
my lady.
ese en el this is the layout of the gazebo.
it's not.
and this will be like el camino.
and then you have a little.
you know there was there was a pick up truck called Chevy Chevrolet Camino?
we would set up the chairs.
there's also one called Nova.
yeah I know.
but nova you know supernova that's sounds like an English word.
but but el Camino I mean that's like wow out there.
ok.
ok.
so this would be like the walkway.
and then you have the different rows of
where is it whoops.
hold on.
this thing fell.
ok.
the different rows of the chairs.
I found this website that does the the fans right.
the but like ok.
there there are rectangular
why don't we just put like you know one fan at at the end of each row blowing down?
no uh the the fans are the paper fans.
I I know.
but why don't we do an electric fan that'll actually do it quickly.
ok.
they're rectangular.
ok traditionally what you do is that you give out um a program at the ceremony.
uhhuh.
that basically says our names the maid of honour the best man.
and a a small little
from my personal experience that is what I've used as a fan the program.
I bend it.
and I kind of fan myself with it!
ok but when I'm doing that.
is that's not our idea right?
no.
oh.
ok.
could we save money by putting the program onto the face of?
this is what I'm trying to tell you!
ok go.
they have them on on a couple websites where it's a a rectangular thick card stock paper fan.
oh yeah.
and then it has a cute little design on there.
I know.
little flowers and stuff.
and you can put the actual program on it.
and you it has the program on it.
that's cool man.
so it's like a little.
what let's take it one step forward then once it's that over.
can you have it?
those cost more money.
ah.
this I can get like
yeah but if that's like a fricking piece of cardboard and a and a and a dental dam or whatever.
yeah and it'll also be about a dollar each.
a dental thing ah what is it called?
yeah and a whatever.
the little stick.
these are about a dollar each.
yeah because it's gotta be thick stock.
or whatever.
the the the fans that open up.
they have these silk ones.
they have paper ones.
they have the little wooden ones all of them.
silk is cool.
the cheapest one is a dollar fifty each.
in all the websites I've looked at.
which is why I wanted you to take me to that Chinese store.
but but that dollar fifty would that allow you to put enough text to put the whole frigging thing?
no!
the whole program?
it doesn't none of them allow you to put the program on it.
wow.
you would have to print it out separately and glue it on or something.
cool.
or we can do programs printed out and rolled up into little thingies.
and then have the fans on top of it.
because you have uh.
I think it would be really mean of us to have an outdoor wedding and not offer fans.
for the people.
well that's why we do it during the cold season.
so that and we tell everybody.
bring your own sweaters!
oh because I wanna have a spring wedding.
I don't wanna have a winter wedding.
I don't wanna have a summer wedding.
I like spring.
well why don't we do it on a day of spring where the temperatures will be around seventy sixty five degrees?
sixty five too cold.
no not once you have all that crap that you're gonna have on you babe?
I'm not getting a huge poofy dress Luke!
ok then we'll move it up to seventy degrees.
why don't we do it on a day that's seventy degrees out?
there's there'll be a lot of old people.
old people still can't handle it.
can't handle what?
the heat.
the temperature it's not good for old people.
seventy degrees is not good for old people what the hell is that?
you wait wait till you're old you know.
they have the perfect temperature they need.
how are there so many old people here in Florida?
isn't this like the the the golfing capital of the world or something for old farts to come?
I'm worried we can't anticipate whether or not it's gonna be seventy degrees or eighty degrees or ninety degrees.
are you saying this because of your parents?
no my parents don't even know about this idea.
and no they're not that old thank you.
well they're older than mine!
oh my god.
well sweetheart I like the idea.
yeah and my my parents are older than yours.
and yet my mom can do more than your mom can do.
because your mom is in pain twenty four seven.
well you know why?
when my mom was your was your mom's age my mom could do anything.
you know why?
because your mom's a vieja.
no because my mother is a fully developed woman.
your mother is a little midget with no meat on her bones.
no meat on her bones?
are you ignoring like two hundred pounds of meat or what?
I don't know.
because my mother has a body.
she has butt.
she has boobs.
your mum is she looks like a square.
and a small square at that.
a little stubby!
my mom
yeah babe fifty years ago in her time maybe she was hot.
now she's not.
you know same thing about your dad.
maybe a hundred years ago he was hot.
but now he just looks like a freaking old you know.
fuck you.
like the crypt keeper.
five years older than the crypt keeper.
mira.
vas a buscar problema.
that's that's the house by the way.
and they have in the back supposedly.
I haven't seen it.
I remember.
we saw it in person.
but it was after the hurricane.
yeah I know.
so it looked like shit.
we didn't go in we didn't go in.
well the whole park was
they have tours.
we can go take a tour of the house.
the whole park was destroyed when we went.
I really wanna go back.
I really wanted to go back with my parents and the girls.
that'd be nice.
have a little day out.
and enjoy the park.
then the uh uh
I I just don't even want to look at it.
the Spanish monastery any more.
no it's just.
I don't really wanna do it in the Spanish monastery.
I I I was disappointed when I went there.
they're they're.
they're too uptight.
and the place is so small and gloomy.
they were too uptight.
and then the whole place looks too small.
it looks gloomy.
it doesn't even look like a happy place.
babe if you want a happy place we'll get married in McDonalds.
come on.
you got you ever gone to one of the little play thingies and been gloomy?
it's beautiful.
no babe.
it's it's cheerful outside.
and there was the other place what was it?
I'm gonna go to my email.
let me find it.
there he is um.
the other place
it was that house in Little Havana.
my sister in law quiere que haga you know.
she she is a linguist.
and so she wants to sort of track you know spanglish.
so she asked me if I would wear it at work.
para ver como es el cambio de un idioma al otro.
so if you see me with this thing I look kinda goofy.
yeah it records it and all como los chips de la camarita.
you know the tiny little one?
and then if you know.
she has um some sort of program cause she is doing you know.
she's got like a grant or something.
yeah and they transcribe it.
and then I guess they figure out you know whatever she does something to do with transcribing and Spanglish and you know lo que hablas and everything.
right right.
pero no!
lo apago.
y si si yo sé que estamos you know todo el mundo hablando inglés o como dice mi hermano si tú no quieres que nadie oyen or personal or something.
so
y tu amiga?
no ha ni llamado?
y tú no puedes salir en esa vaina?
hello si es four wheel drive?
nieve.
mi hermana vive en Georgia.
y no ha habido nada de nieve.
bueno yo no sé dónde está la casa de ella.
bueno puede que sí en las montanas sí sí haya.
ya más muerta que viva.
pero a qué hora te llamó a las ocho de la mañana?
anoche?
ah anoche.
eso queda como por la mitad del estado.
no no no!
eso está en el medio del estado.
está o al norte o al sur de Gainesville.
eso es horse country.
eso es horse country.
it's really pretty actually when you.
I think it's before Gainesville.
I think it's before Gainesville.
when you when you drive on seventy five.
I think it's seventy five.
it's real pretty.
I mean you can see the big las las pieces of property con que parece que estuvieras en you know en Virginia where they have the horses.
it's horse country.
you see the big.
cause porque ahí esa parte del estado has a little bit of hills not like a lot of hills.
el seventy five right.
no no no.
entonces it is like horse country.
so you see the big properties with you know you know the trees.
and you know you see the horses.
it's very pretty actually I mean.
los dos ella dice que lo tenían puesto ayer también.
y salieron los dos.
es que están perfect.
good job dear.
qué monada!
y qué y no el el tamaño no lo pudistes escoger mejor porque no es posible.
right it is so cute.
it's very cute.
qué?
pero también que a mí se me parece a la madre.
si tú ves las las
si tú ves la foto de la madre de la.
ay qué mala!
very cute.
está de lo más mono el chiquito.
coño hasta frío.
pero yo no yo no oigo el calor tú sabes.
digo lo huelo.
tú sabes que cuando tú pones la calefacción.
la primera vez que se prende tiene un colorcito.
el lado allá hace sesenta y uno.
uno.
es el north side.
so it doesn't get any sun.
bueno.
cuál el que vive aquí al lado, no?
cóbrale.
qué fresco!
you can call it this.
ah los manda solos y él no viene?
oye qué frescura!
qué fres.
bueno too bad.
no.
ché right.
right right right right right right right.
y y y te han hecho pa que nadie entienda lo que dicen.
porque si te hubieran escrito en en el lenguaje de todo el mundo maybe pero
pues sí el vi.
cómo se llama Helen?
yo me paro.
y digo.
coño qué frío hace!
voy.
y veo ahí en el.
y es el sesenta y uno.
esa no yo lo siento mucho.
hace demasiado frío.
yo sé que ya para las las cuarto de la tarde no hace frío.
voy.
y vamos a prender el el la calefacción.
y me dice Jennifer.
tú crees que tiene?
y yo heat.
que no hay calefacción?
lo más probable es que no haya.
entonces entró donde Helen.
y fue para allá.
y me mira Esmeralda porque yo le dije que yo la he prendido.
y yo me hice la que yo no tengo nada que decir.
ha sido un comentario.
yo voy a decir.
sí hacía mucho frío.
dice el se levanta a los cinco minutos Lilian.
y dice.
ahora dice sesenta y tres.
y le digo.
bueno por lo menos subió two degrees cause it used to be sixty one.
y acá decía seventy four.
le digo.
a eso lo tocó él porque Jennifer y yo pusimos setenta.
Jennifer y yo lo pusimos en setenta.
sí pero no se no se ha quitado la chaqueta.
así que también tiene frío.
y eso que allá atrás por lo menos les cae el sol.
pero aquí en el north side we don't ever get direct sun.
we get no direct sun we get.
a veces sesenta y uno sesenta y uno.
cuándo regresa?
él está loco.
y a él se le ha warm up the la la sangre se le ha puesto un
he doesn't miss it in other words.
no.
hace como cinco años.
that's what they said about five years.
y yo esta mañana que salí de la casa que si.
te tenía que ir al súper cause I had no milk.
mi carro tiene un thermostat que te dice you know.
you heat it.
y te dice what it is.
thirty six.
yo me cago en la madre.
vaya cuando ya regresé del grocery.
el grocer decía cuarenta y uno.
pero cuando I dropped the groceries and I left decía treinta y nueve.
y le digo coño.
maybe.
no cause it has a sensor.
and the sensor is on on the dashboard.
so I guess it takes it.
in the the one I think I'm I I mean this car provides heat.
pero no es como los carros normales que si tú quieres calor tú lo mueves a rojito.
the only way I can turn the heat is I have to tell it auto.
and turn the temperature up.
because then the sensor will know that is cold outside and it throws hot air like you don't you can have
and it takes time.
versus the old fashion you turn the knob to the red.
when the car is warm it throws hot air.
it takes time because engine your engine's too cold.
pero the first time I went to use this heat a few years ago I'm like.
where is the heat?
you know.
and then.
right.
because it's auto.
electrical.
right.
pero el aire acondicionado sí te da el chance.
you can hit on.
and you turn the you know you.
I don't like I don't like that that they do the.
it's kinda weird.
I don't like it.
I mean I like the old fashion knobs.
brrru!
you know.
right.
I mean it warms up.
but it's weird.
it's it's it's it's not it's counter-intuitive because you're used to saying ok I want warm.
lo pongo al rojo.
déjame decirte.
mi carro tiene heated seats.
nunca lo he usado.
ayer que me monté con Irene fuimos a comer.
ella lo prendió.
y dije.
ay coño Irene tengo el calentito.
me dice.
no es que tienen el el heating thing.
so when I got in the car yesterday I went.
oh!
mine has it too!
click I turned it on.
it's really.
qué rico!
I didn't turn it on this morning cause I was so bundled up.
I didn't need it.
right.
it is supposedly.
para la espalda right right.
so I was like.
cool!
the first time I ever use it!
but you know what I didn't use it this morning cause I was so bundled up I didn't need it.
no I didn't even turn the heat on because I figured I was going to wait.
where is Elba?
ah.
, tú va te eh Víctor está viviendo con ustedes otra vez?
ay la verdad es que Jorge es muy buen marido.
me acuerdo que tú me dijiste.

they're not.
coño pues that's not fair!
but can't he do something about it.
and say that they?
you know.
de todo un poco.
right right right.
right.
mmhm.
you can't do that.
right right right.
entonces la tienen cogida contigo.
right right right they don't give you a whole lot.
yo no sé cómo la gente vive del unemployment.
porque es un pain.
yo no sé cómo la gente vive del unemployment porque es un pain.
yo me acuerdo la única vez que.
right right.
that's good.
y a si tu marido gets along with him that's great.
right.
no.
y y for Elba is good cause tienen la tienen los dos.
y ti bueno tiene dos papás which can be a little can be a little challenging.
that's great.
that's great.
which one?
so he goes over to the creepy crawly and he pulls it out the pool and one leg is broken.
that's why it wasn't moving.
the pump was good.
but he replaced the seal the o rings.
and how much did he charge?
a hundred and twenty dollars.
and how much would it been if we went and got the gauge and fixed the creepy crawly up?
the creepy crawly would have been maybe thirty bucks if I would have gone.
but I didn't know it was broken.
and the gauge thing the pressure?
the gauge thing he replaced it.
uh I don't know how much that cost me but uh the visit alone was sixty.
and then he replaced the o rings which really.
this is the Bill guy?
yeah Bill.
did you ask him about the pool heater?
or you didn't ask?
you know he said he said.
listen um uh
because I told him about my brother in law and everything.
goes.
listen I guarantee you he's gonna get you a better price than my boss is gonna let me sell you one for.
and what about install installing it?
no installing if we have this guy.
or Paul.
yo no quiero contar con él.
I'll call.
with Paul?
because then.
él se demora.
and he is he is going to school now.
and he has the
he means well pero when family gets put last.
the company.
the grass isn't growing here.
and where's the gak thing you're saying was coming out of it?
look you see it?
no.
coming out of the.
white little exhausts.
no not really.
if you stand up and look it looks like slime.
looks like gak.
but has it gone better since you cleaned the footer?
no.
he says has to come over and do a um
coil cleaning.
a coil cleaning.
but the guy that installed the antenna said that not to touch it that that's poisonous and corrosive and uh
ay.
Paul said.
no it's just dirt and and water that's accumulated.
it's not toxic.
it's not corrosive.
it's nothing.
exagerado!
I have to jump in the pool tomorrow at some point.
I hope it's warm.
because I gotta to put the blocker on the drain so the creepy crawly doesn't get stuck and
and it's clean?
it's gonna be cold.
it's clean.
I want the heater.
would be nice.
it should be coming in soon.
ten to twelve days.
Wednesday?
eight to fifteen days.
they said ten to twelve.
eight to fifteen.
it said it on the package.
eight to fifteen business days.
mmhm.
today counts as a business day.
yeah.
so we went on Thursday?
uh
yeah we went on Thursday.
yeah.
so today is the eighth.
today is the eighth so any time after this.
yeah.
what time do you have to be at the workshop tomorrow?
eight o'clock in Miami Springs.
what time do I have to leave?
there's no traffic.
seven twenty leave at seven thirty.
did I tell you that Julie's going?
but does Julie know if you can apply then for mentoring points?
Julie said you could.
so if you go to the workshop you can?
she's mentoring.
so she's mentoring and she's gonna be able to count all the points.
yeah.
all the hours.
yeah but I think she's just going to scam it and uh you know mark the ones she's already done because there was a certain number that you had to have.
there's no way you can do ninety from now to March thirty first unless you're sleeping with the person and living with the person.
maybe they'll the last batch.
yeah but I know that you had to input it prior to.
like now like they have like little deadlines that you have to input like the hours that you had before January.
you have to put the hours before January the hours before February the hours before March.
oh you just ninety hours of mentoring.
no hay duda de eso.
and the truth of the matter is you have.
no I know.
and I know I've done the ninety hours.
I just.
and I'm giving you mine.
mmhm no you can't give me yours.
I was telling Gloria.
no.
I will though.
um I was telling Gloria that after I stayed with Janet till ten o'clock at night you know and we're late and everything uh she e mails me today.
I'm not gonna be able to video the second lesson again.
you know I'm just what I have.
I hate when people do that.
I don't know if I told you that.
and I just didn't respond.
and I told Gloria because.
Sunshine!
hundred percent if she's not gonna give herself a hundred percent?
it's not worth it.
I have enough to do.
I've to work on the fricking formatting crap.
Sunshine be careful.
it was very minor what they told me I had to change.
what?
centering a page.
margins a no sé qué on the appendix.
but you see what I'm saying is they should not give you because they've asked you to format a thousand different ways.
they should have one person at the end of the process once everything's approved um doing the formatting.
ok you need to change this and this.
that's what the college.
so should have one person in charge of of formatting.
in the college of education they hire Mrs Dr Blap to do that.
but they submitted my dissertation with those formatting issues because they knew that it would still pass for the defense.
some of the catches she didn't catch.
and she caught things that they didn't catch.
qué?
I was looking today.
los varones estaban jugando fútbol.
y Maruja the girl from across the street.
oh.
was outside talking on the phone.
uhuh.
and I was watching this from Rosa's bedroom.
and uh I would see that she would be looking at them and talking on the phone and
they would catch passes in front of her.
when have they ever decided to play football here?
two weeks ago.
when we had the music playing.
mmhm.
I was thinking that I don't know Mary siempre se fastidia getting all the drinks.
we should get.
did you saw that orange Gatorade thing from when you're coaching?
yeah.
we should every now and then have.
why what's wrong with Mary?
que these kids need to drink.
and they probably go into Mary's house I think all the time and drink.
we need to be supplying them with drinks.
when I was a kid you know we used to do?
we used to get the hose and drink from the hose.
if they're too prissy to drink from the hose then let them go inside and get drinks.
ok they have not.
I'm not going to be supplying little thing.
the next thing you know I'd be taking pictures of them as they're playing basketball.
and he is a.
uh.
my grass isn't growing.
I'm not happy.
you know why?
because these trees block the sunlight.
and why does it have to be grass here?
I like it grass.
what else would you recommend?
pebbles mulch.
mulch do you think I should?
I have two bags of mulch I can lay.
then do it because ahí no va a crecer nada.
look i i it the shade is completely covering it.
I have hope.
and you never know if birds have eaten the seeds.
Sunshine!
no.
bird can't even see the seeds.
they don't see worms either yet they eat them.
yeah they see the worms.
they dig into the ground to get a worm.
she has something in her tail.
y Rosa hoy dijo que la iba a bañar.
Sunshine.
ella luce limpia?
no.
ah.
she hasn't been bathed.
she took her in the morning like she was gonna bathe her.
milagro que Marga hasn't come out.
como así.
huh?
she's coming?
eh?
no.
I think they're all enjoying t v.
I didn't think anybody was gonna be at work today.
Sunshine get away from that cactus.
ah?
I thought was just gonna be me and Rosa.
and I even told Rosa I was gonna get there at tennish.
pero no hubo tráfico so I was able to go straight.
and and that's it.
go in F I U.
and picking up the thing.
there's no traffic.
was she there before you?
no but Susie was.
no I'm saying Susie.
yeah when I got in the door was unlocked and how weird.
but wasn't she supposed to be out?
I thought everybody was gonna be out today.
that's what I had heard that everybody was out.
es que she gave everybody the day off except for herself.
y
which is fine.
we made a lot of progress.
y cómo te fue el día?
all day.
the morning was getting ready for the meeting.
basically it was C C's integrates.
I gave her the ideas.
pero she
modified them.
complicated them.
she C C ed them.
if that means complicate then yeah.
you know these are meant to be for teacher assistants and they're supposed to be non threatening low prep you know emphasizing.
and I had told her you know do something on conservation because there's water
I given her.
long story short it was very complicated so
I had already gone through them because supposedly that's what I was gonna do yesterday.
so then in the morning I went through them I made copies of everything and then I also gave.
for example one of the reviewers had recommended a book in the lesson of displacement where the water is displaced
mmhm.
uh called the crow and the pitcher.
it's an Aesop fable.
Aesop.
eso mismo.
Aesop.
A E S O P.
Aesop.
it has an A.
Aesop's fables.
A Aesop.
Aesop's fable.
you know the crow and the pitcher?
anyway it has to do with a crow who wants to drink some water from a pitcher.
but his beak doesn't go inside.
so he needs putting little stones in until the water rises enough he can drink it.
and the thing is using your wit to get whatever.
but it's a lesson on displacement which is exactly the second lesson.
Ruby used it.
so I showed.

it's already it was already closed.
because she likes to sleep.
did you talk to Julie?
she put it in the boca.
she was Jessica's monkey.
no no no boca no!
no she licked it.
no!
now slidie.
hello!
pizza's here.
speaking of slides.
how you gonna pay for it?
slide!
I hope Rosa did it on the credit card.
did you credit card?
no it's already online.
oh yeah?
now she's sliding backwards.
and the tip?
tell Rosa the pizza's here.
Marga tell Rosa the pizza's here.
Rosa the pizza's here!
so was faster than thirty minutes.
Rosa the pizza's here!
Rosa!
she's asleep.
tell her if she doesn't go there's no pizza.
Rosa the pizza's.
where you didn't put it on the credit card?
no.
we're kinda connected right now.
I have ten dollars in my purse.
I don't have any money in my purse.
put it on the credit card?
I thought she put it on the credit card.
come on.
go can you answer the door?
he might go away and there goes your pizza.
not my pizza.
I'll chase him down.
turn the lights on.
I've ten.
that's all I got.
espera.
tengo una cosa chiquitica.
y tengo una cosa que tengo que hacer en la computadora.

qué más?

creo que es todo.
ah bueno pero fin de semana so you can take your time.
tengo tres días.
limpiar mi cuarto este fin de semana.
voy a limpiarlo bien bien recoger todo organizar todo.
that's good.
no it isn't.
sí porque tú eres bien organizado.
no I'm not.
yeah you are.
I just have a habit of not putting things where they go.
mmhm.
y cómo te está yendo el?
o no?
ah no sé todavía de lo que espera que contraten a más personas en el To Go.
y eso cuánto se.
well I have to train them.
so
you have to train them?
yeah.
so
hasta ahora no se han contratado a nadie.
pero cuando los um contraten me toca entrenarlos.
and we have to see if they get good at it.
they're actually trying to like succeed in the job.
y ya después me imagino que un mes o algo.
ya me puedo mover el server.
pero por ahora estoy en el To Go.
so yeah.
well there should be a lot of people that wanna work in To Go.
huh?
well there should be a lot of people that need work.
well I don't know.
they haven't hired anybody yet.
so I'm just waiting.
how old do you have to be to work there?
can't Alberto work there?
he's sixteen.
no you have to be eighteen to work in Chili's.
that sucks.
yeah.
no it doesn't.
because if you do it with kids you have to work around their school hours.
yeah but like over the summer like a summer job.
and
maybe.
well yeah maybe we get people in the summer.
but for now we don't have anybody.
and they don't hire under sixteen.
and if they were to hire.
under what eighteen or sixteen?
uh under eighteen.
but if they hired someone like sixteen they can only work certain amount of hours.
and they can't work before six.
they can't work after eleven.
so I don't know if they're gonna hire younger kids in the summer.
but I think they're not supposed to.
I think the law says that we're not supposed to.
then how come Publix hires.
well because
you only have to be fourteen to work at Publix?
I know but the only job they give you is to bag groceries which is not hard.
so I think.
yeah you have to know where to put the eggs and then all the bread and that kind of stuff.
yeah but that's not hard.
I think it must be hard.
no it's not.
y um el jueves I have um a trainer meeting.
which is?
a meeting where trainers go.
and we talk about progress.
and.
that must suck.
no it doesn't.
because no te acuerdas?
the first time we went to we went to like Dave and Busters I think.
and then the second time.
lucky.
we went to Maggianos.
what happened to discussing progress?
we did.
and then they gave us food.
and now we're going to Dave and busters again.
lucky.
yeah on Thursday.
but how many people are trainers?
a lot.
like twenty.
o es que hay como there's like about four or five cooks that are trainers.
there's.
there's like in To Gos there's only two.
but I think that I'm the only one that's going.
and servers there's like ten servers.
ten about ten servers that are.
and what do trainers do?
trainers.
train.
show other people how the job works.
then why'd you put you as a trainer?
very funny.
yeah I know you're good at that.
but uh what I'm saying is that why'd they pick you out of everyone that there is?
because they see that I'm the one that knows how to do it.
that knows the job better than others.
that can explain it to others.
ok.
uh that's the thing that gets you the discount that trainer card thing on the back that says discount?
yeah.
oh cool.
so that's an advantage.
pero
it's good to be a trainer.
because you're helping your workplace by showing new people.
get it?
that's the whole point.
yeah.
so yeah I have a meeting that day.
ok.
y la universidad cómo te va?
uh bien.
on Monday I have a midterm of art appreciation that class.
they give you midterms?
oh I had a midterm.
I did I had I I have a midterm I had midterms.
I did good.
I only have for that class.
I don't have a midterm for English.
you have finals?
yeah I have finals.
I have to take an exit exam in in English class.
like in order to pass it I have to pass the class and I have to pass that exam to go on to English um eleven O one yeah.
eleven O isn't it one O one?
no.
eleven O ok.
yeah so that.
and uh in math not doing to well yeah.
got third.
I'm taking seventh grade math.
actually ninth.
it's not seventh grade.
it's ninth grade actually.
but I'm gonna take it next year.
look I'm two years advanced.
well I'm not doing bad.
it's just I struggle with some parts of the math.
but it's not really hard.
which are?
multiplication addition subtraction?
no.
that's the easy part.
division?
it's like the problems.
you know like the ones where it says if this this object has a height of this and it has a uh width of this so what is the area or something like that.
that's not that hard.
well it confuses me.
so I had kinda struggled on the problem ones.
oh yeah that always happens to me.
I I just can't put uh I don't I'm good at math I'm good with the math.
I just can't do the English part of the math.
English part of the math?
well like the reading and the English and that stuff.
ok.
yeah so uh I think I have like a B or a C in that class right now.
but hopefully I can get my grades up.
that's what I have in math.
I have either a B minus or a C plus.
yeah because apparently everybody says that in architecture there's a lot of math.
yeah.
you have to like measure the lines and all that stuff.
yeah so I don't think I'll have problems.
that's just people over exaggerate.
I think.
we'll see.
I don't think I have that much math.
but I don't know.
it depends when I transfer.
we'll see.
do you know when you're planning to transfer?
no huh.
probably hopefully next year.
five years.
next year?
if I.
well I don't think so.
but like maybe end of next year I'll finish in B C C.
and then I'll start the winter in F I U if possible.
but we'll see.
ok.
yeah.
so cómo estás con las novias?
?
qué?
do I have to answer that?
uh yeah.
I'd rather not.
ok you don't have to.
you don't have to tell me if you like anybody.
you just have to tell me que como te va.
bien.
bien te va bien?
funny.
oh.
mm.
yeah so is there any movie you wanna see that's coming up?
um mm
no?
thinking thinking thinking.
Meet the spartans.
but you don't want to see that.
no.
that movies looks hilarious.
well I do too.
it wasn't in theatres when I went the other day.
really?
I didn't see it.
no they probably already took it out.
yeah.
I wanna see one that's called Stop loss.
which is about what?
it's a movie about these um guys that are in the army.
and so they were in Iraq for I dunno I guess couple years or months or something.
and then they come back to Texas.
because that's where they're from I guess.
and so they're ready to get out of the army.
and because they did their duty and everything.
and then the army says that they're going back.
because they don't.
oh yeah I've heard about that one.
yeah.
they don't have enough people to fight the war over there.
so they're sending them back.
so that's what I think stop loss means.
that's dumb.
and so like it's a battle deciding if they're going to do it or not.
and it looks pretty cool.
plus it has cute guys in it.
yes.
so yeah.
since I love going to movies with cute guys.
that's a plus.
so we'll see if hmm yeah.
we'll see if I go see that movie.
if we go see that movie because it looks cool.
yeah when I get ungrounded in two months.
ok maybe not with you.
but maybe I'll go see it or something.
qué cuentas?
ah nada más.
nothing new here.
I applied for a credit card.
what?
I applied for a credit card.
don't you already have like.
no credit cards.
what's the difference?
debit card is like they take the money out of your bank account.
yeah.
and credit is that ah you have to pay for everything.
you get a bill of the things you paid with your credit card.
and then you have to pay them off.
so
why isn't debit better?
you don't have to worry about bills.
well.
you just have to worry about losing all your money.
well it really depends.
like I think it depends on what you're paying.
because if it's a large sum and they take it out of your bank account and then you have other stuff to pay then you're gonna be short in money.
so if you do credit card they give you a certain time for you to pay them off.
so you don't have to you know pay them on the spot.
oh.
so yeah.
y qué pasó con Adrian?
what about him?
te siguen hablando o no?
yeah sometimes.
but he doesn't hang out with you guys?
yeah sometimes.
but he gets annoying.
so you guys aren't friends any more?
yeah but he's always like.
he always gets annoying.
and like I don't know.
what about David?
yeah he's fine.
yeah well friends with Sam.
who's gonna be who's gonna be your best friend when Sam leaves?
I don't know.
well I don't know because um Adrian gets annoying.
now he barely has any friends.
like well we're still sorta his friends.
but he gets like all annoying so not really.
and aside from us he has like no friends at all.
um
oh David David's yeah David's my friend.
and I have another friend named Adam.
he no he's mostly David's friend.
but
sometimes mine.
I sometimes talk to him I mean.
I don't know.
we'll see.
mmhm.
so tu colegio it's just a middle school or is it middle school and high school like in the same building?
in the same building it's middle.
but like right next to us is the elementary.
and then there's like a preschool there.
and then the high school is all the way near.
not not wait.
somewhere near the library.
wherever that is.
so
oh it's over there by the library?
yeah the one next to F i u and the library.
so tu colegio hasta qué grado va?
twelfth.
no pero the building like to what grade does it go to?
eighth.
eighth grade y después te vas a pasar allá a Sheridan?
yeah.
hmm.
yeah but it'll be the same people.
the only difference is that for eleme for elementary there are three different campuses the west campus east campus and F s u campus.
east campus moves to central campus.
middle at west.
and F s u go together and move to west campus middle right?
and then west.
which is where you are?
yeah.
west campus middle and east campus and no and central campus middle move together to.
what's it called?
the big high school.
right?
mmhm.
but like I'll still be with the same people.
it's just like each time we keep adding more and more.
so um what classes do you think you're gonna take next year?
next year I'm taking algebra for math which is a ninth grade class.
um I'm taking let's see for language arts what am I taking?
I think I'm I'm taking advanced language arts which is eighth grade class because advanced is a year advanced at my school.
um I'm taking advanced science probably.
um I don't have to take reading.
because if I get a four or a five on the F Cat um I don't have to take reading.
because in seventh grade in eighth grade I mean you don't have to take reading right?
and um right now I'm taking seventh grade reading.
so and next be taking eighth grade right?
so and since in eighth grade I don't have to take anything I get an extra elective.
so what are you gonna do?
don't say P e.
why I'm taking P e.
you don't even like it.
you say it tires you too much.
yeah I do.
no I never said that.
what other elective is there?
um I'm gonna take P e and I don't know.
what other elective is there?
there's band which I'm never gonna join.
um art which everyone hates the teacher.
Spanish I speak Spanish already.
um
so you wouldn't take art class just because you don't like the teacher?
do you even know the teacher?
yeah.
it's the same one for every elective?
for every art elective.
well I think you should take that class.
yeah I might take art.
or and P e.
I think art is better.
because.
I'll take art and P e.
but if I if I could only pick one of them I'll pick P e.
no.
why don't why don't you want me to take P e?
because you said you didn't even like it.
I never said that.
I said uh.
so does everybody have to take P e or
no I I wanna take P e.
well how come um Marissa took P e?
does she like it?
no she she weighs like two tons.
so you know what she did?
the first day she feinted in P e.
so why'd she take it?
she didn't want to.
but she had to because um um yeah she was taking wheel which is one quarter P e one quarter research one quarter of computers and one quarter of art.
um and she had that.
and with the quarter P e she had her first quarter she feinted.
on the first day she feinted like five times.
pretended then?
what?
pretended?
no she actually feinted.
how can you feint five times?
like not on the same day.
but like the first day he put us to run for some reason like a lot.
we had to run like two miles the first day.
and we she she collapsed like she just collapsed was on the floor.
I think twice in the same day both.
she like collapsed a few times until she finally realized that she'll get an F if she keeps on like feinting in the middle of class.
uhuh.
qué hora son?
four seventeen.
I go to work at five thirty today.
hmm.
I'm gonna do Q a.
yeah?
didn't I already explain it to you.
Q a means quality and assertion I think or accuracy.
ok I don't need to know that part.
yeah.
what do you do in Q a?
I have to
what do you have to do?
I have to um
hold on.
what do you have to do?
give me my phone thank you.
ok fine.
don't take my glasses.
um I have to like put them the the food like on trays.
mm thanks.
what do you have?
and like uh check them to see if they're accurate how the people ordered it.
and then send it to the tables.
but have to do it like every ticket has to be under fifteen.
and has to be cooked properly the way they want it with dressings they ask for it.
so if it if it's like bad you get blamed for it?
if the people didn't like how it was cooked or how it was made or if it was missing something they just send it back.
and we'll fix it for them.
and meanwhile manager goes and talks to them.
and tells them.
oh we'll fix it for you.
and like apologizes.
and makes sure that the customer is satisfied.
so yeah.
hmm.
that it it's way fun that To Gos.
To Go I don't wanna do To Go any more.
why don't you get tips at To Go?
so I would get tips as server.
I would get triple.
what to get on a Friday night.
yeah I know.
but you'd also.
yup yeah but you also get tips.
um what's it called?
ah at To Go you don't gotta Q a?
well I get paid more in Q a.
so
you do?
how much an hour?
yeah.
I get paid eight for To Go.
and I get paid ten for Q a.
yeah but how much tips do you make in like a day in To Go?
like thirty five maybe.
yeah thirty five and.
if it's a good night.
if it's a good night around thirty five dollars.
yeah but you you make
but not always.
it's not consistent.
you make like ten dollars more in in To Go per day right?
huh?
you you will make like ten dollars more a day in To Go?
maybe.
but I don't always do Q a.
I asked yesterday.
I went in at four.
but I had to work at six.
so I didn't know.
I thought it was at four o'clock.
so I was two hours early.
so I was like.
you're always like five minutes late.
and and you and you go like two hours early?
well I didn't know.
I didn't know it was uh until six.
how about checking the schedule?
so yesterday I um did a Starbucks run.
I went to go get coffee for everybody.
and then when I came back I started helping out one of the managers.
and I was doing prep work which is like you know making the sauces and cooking the meat and cutting it up into pieces and stuff like that.
isn't that what the chef's do?
the cutting the?
yeah.
but managers do that too.
so I started helping him.
and then I started to ask him questions about how much they get paid and stuff.
and he says they get paid like like a thousand like eleven hundred around there um every two weeks.
so I mean for my age that's not bad.
if I can get a manager position.
yeah but you I don't really think.
where are you gonna get a manager position?
they could start training me.
and then eventually just tell corporate that they're training me.
manager of what?
To Go general manager?
well no.
I mean if they really train me as manager I'm probably not gonna stay at that store.
because they're always moving the managers to other restaurants.
I mean to other stores of Chili's.
other Chili's?
other Chili's yeah?
they call them stores instead of restaurants.
because they're all restaurants.
that's.
but they're different place.
they're they're located different places.
so they could move me which is not what I really want.
but if they're paying.
ok well if if they're paying I mean for that amount it doesn't sound bad to me.
ok.
so I mine as well take the opportunity if they offer.
yeah but well like probably where would you get moved to?
I don't know.
it's not up to me or them.
it's up to the corporate um place.
so
what's the corporate place?
it's like where they decide things about Chili's like the stuff on the menu like uh.
I don't know.
stuff they wanna change in each store.
stuff like that.
I don't know.
yeah so I don't know.
we'll see.
but or or I might actually quit Chili's.
yeah but where would you go to work?
I was talking to your mom the other day.
I might like look for a job at um
B c c?
ah what's it called?
yeah B c c.
like there's this department called
the find what department?
there's this department called something department of visual arts and something else.
and uh I might see if they have anything over there.
so we'll see.
I don't know.
but you know.
we'll see.
yeah I met get a job there or I was thinking maybe in the summer to work less or
why work less in the summer?
because um.
aren't you supposed to work more in the summer?
no.
I wanna work less because I wanna get into dance.
I wanna get into dance classes.
I don't care what you think.
it's not up to you.
wait what type of dance classes?
it's up to me.
like ballet dancing that you stand on your toes and then your toes start bleeding?
no like modern.
like modern.
good I'm like
like hip hopish popish.
I don't know.
something will come up.
but I have to see.
I think I get the other day I saw like there's a place in Silver lakes.
but I don't know.
it looked like for young kids.
so I don't know.
I have to look for a place where where to go.
but maybe we'll see.
yeah but it wouldn't be like every single day.
it would probably be like twice a week.
no it wouldn't.
it would be like in the morning so.
but but then I'm gonna take two classes in the summer.
I'm gonna take reading and English.
so
I wanna focus on class and dancing not so much on work.
because I'm working forty hours right now.
I don't need to work that much.
I mean I don't hardly pay anything.
so I want my summer like to relax.
and to do something knew.
get it?
yeah sorta.
y tú no te vas a meter en nada?
no sé.
quiero hacer algún deporte.
pero no sé cuál.
you wanna do deporte?
why don't you play baseball?
no.
baseball?
you don't like it?
first of all I don't like it.
second of all baseball's like one of those sports like you need to start playing when you're like five years old.
no you don't.
yeah because baseball's like.
no you don't.
who told you that lie?
Alberto started playing when he was nine which is still kinda young.
and most people.
well baseball's like one of those sports that you need to start playing when you're like really really young.
no you don't.
yeah you do.
no you don't.
you can catch up.
no you can't!
yes you can.
you can play anything you want if you put your mind to it.
yeah that's what everyone says.
seriously.
but uh let's see.
you you already played soccer.
apparently you sucked at it.
yeah I liked it.
but I sucked at it.
baseball you're not even considering it.
football they'd kill you in the field.
shut up.
basketball I don't know.
I don't even.
too short.
yeah I don't even think you're you're the type of kid that's like for sports.
no offence.
but yeah I think you're more artistic person.
I think you should pursue something like music
no.
or art.
no.
something like that.
because I don't really see you playing sports.
sorry.
yeah.
it's up to you though.
I mean you could play golf.
no.
but uh I don't think so either.
what else.
ah
pingpong's a sport.
you could play that.
I meant something that like involves running or something like that.
well ok if you get into sport it involves you actually training and practicing.
and you're not really that type of person.
why not?
because based on experience I've seen that you want to do something.
but you don't want to like practice.
says who?
you don't like to.
what experience?
practice and see if you're in.
you don't really try to get better.
like you expect.
like what?
you expect to learn something.
and that's that.
like piano lessons when you took that.
that was like five or ten years ago.
yeah but I mean you could go back to it now.
and it'd be the same for you.
you don't practice.
you don't anything.
no.
and like
what?
I don't know.
it's just you're not
but that was boring.
I didn't really like it.
it's not boring.
yeah it is.
just it's not probably not your thing.
but it's up to you.

because her shirt never covers her stomach brother.

where you able to do the the job for Jaime?
what he was doing for you?

what he had asked you to do?
yeah but I need more.
do you wanna move a little bit more back because maybe there's less mosquitoes?
is that your teacher?
oh yeah.
do you.
se va?
no I guess she was gonna meet up with another student.

um
ay let's go there.
because the reason that this is here is because of the grass.
no but
ok let's move a little bit.
yeah.
don't drop it.
entonces is working now.
but why don't we sit in one of those things?
because if we are around grass it's gonna be mosquitoes.
she told me she ella lo dijo que si se si se vacía una mesa que podemos ir pa allá.
but the.
ok.
el lío es no sentarnos en la misma mesa.
look at the.
it's another?
mmhm.
no this is.
hmm.
do you wanna see it?
no.
um.
anyway.
with anything?
I think.
no no she doesn't at all.
her hair.
turn let's just turn around.
gives her back give her back.
yeah.
so we don't look like crazy people.
so let's talk about something new.
let's talk one let's talk one topic that we could talk about.
Emilio.
Emilio?
Emilio is a very
complicated.
long complicated.
mira para esto.
los mosquitos nos están siguiendo.
there's mosquitoes everywhere.
I'm I'm wondering if inside there's just mosquitoes like actually inside the building.
yeah I know.
but who cares?
well I give it a break.
let me see.
maybe they just followed us over here.
and now they are gonna leave.
mosquitoes.
ok.
so
Emilio.
Emilio is a very complicated person.
I know.
we could talk about something else.
not not him?
no.
ok.
um
Peter?
Annie.
but Annie is what?
uh Annie today was talking to Peter.
but nothing.
yeah.
yeah.
ok.
I don't know how Selena alw always governs Laura?
she does?
she wants yeah she went to Selena.
y she she tells me.
dile a Selena que vaya a almorzar.
que vaya a almorzar?
yeah so I called her.
pero Selena was eating or ella ella no estaba comiendo?
Selena was eating right?
and then she got out of the lunch.
and she was like.
y ahora que que Selena coma.
dile que venga a comer.
like como si fuera una madre.
por qué?
I don't know man.
she I I don't like that lady.
that lady like she is always like.
she's too bossy.
she's always bossing.
oh you ok you wanna hear a story?
ok.
um before yes before yesterday Iria gave me a job to do.
mmhm.
so then I I terminé el trabajo para ahí sí.
and then the next thi the next step that I had to do was um divide the patients by their case manager.
mmhm.
so there was the there was a stack of papers for Clara.
and there was a stack of patients for
Selena.
Selena right.
so then lo que Iria me dijo que haga era coger los los files de de Selena y entregárselos a su case manager a Selena para que ella los file in.
right?
so and I go to Selena.
but the thing was that they were active patients right?
so then active patients she wanted to follow them into their.
so I um whether it was built or not built right.
so then all the ones that I had finished were all built.
and they were active.
and they were all built.
so then I went to Selena.
y yo le dije.
Selena ya estos pacientes están están.
pero Iria quiere Iria me me pidió que los filees en su.
no mentira.
habían dos que tenían problemas.
verdad?
mmhm.
so yo le dije yo le dije.
Selena estos dos tienen problemas.
and I didn't even write on the post it the problem.
Iria wrote it with her handwriting.
and it was simple.
it was a simple simple problem.
um one of them was to call the nurse and verify that there was a sharp container in the house.
and the other one was um to call the nurse and verify that it was that his her son was still the hou the care care giver or something like that.
very simple.
que se puede hacer en cinco minutos.
yeah that you could do it in five minutes.
I understood what Selena was telling me.
but that's not my problem because I'm just telling her what Iria is telling me to do.
so whatever Selena esto eran como diez pacientes.
and out of them all those ten two of them had problems.
y le dije.
Selena estos dos pacientes tienen problemas.
est el póster está ahí mismo explicándote el problema para que tú lo puedas hacer.
entonces ella me mira.
and she goes.
eh y por qué.
yo no entiendo por qué la persona que revisó esto no no lo hizo de una vez.
no llamó a la al que resolvió el problema.
mientras que no sea ella la que resolvió el problema.
and she goes.
yo no entiendo por qué la persona que tenía este que tenía este eh que que revisó esto no me ayu no lo rev no lo hizo.
no no arregló el problema.
and then it's funny because I should have just been like bueno hizo eso y no le da la gana de de de revisar eso porque ya te está pagando a ti un salario y quiere que tú tú eres el case manager y quiere que el case manager lo revise
yeah like because it's true.
I mean yo le revisé.
like if Iria is telling you.
Iria told you.
revisa esto.
no resuelve esto no revise.
exactly because there's a reason that they are the case managers so they could resolver los problemas.
and not only that.
like if she says she doesn't feel like doing it she doesn't feel like doing it.
she is paying Selena a a salary of a case manager so she could solve those problems.
so the reason she's the case manager for the patient.
right.
so ella yo la miró.
y yo le dije.
no sé Selena.
porque the thing is with Selena I've already learned to just have patience with her.
I'm not gonna bitch at her.
oh yeah no you can't talk to her if you don't have patience.
I'm not gonna talk back to her.
I'm not gonna talk back to her.
and I'm not gonna bitch at her because there's just no point.
so I go to her um.
I looked at her.
yo le dije.
no sé eh no sé Selena esto me lo dio.
Selena.
all these mosquitoes!
esto me lo dio esto me lo dio Iria.
y e ella me lo pasó para ti.
entonces ella lo cogió.
like she got it from my hand.
and she goes.
she put it to the completely to the side.
and she goes.
bueno I'm not gonna stop when.
bueno I'm not gonna stop what I'm doing right now to solve this.
so this is gonna be this is gonna be later on whenever I have a chance.
y yo le dije.
no no no sin apuro Selena.
tú haz eso mañana por la mañana when you want when you when you when you are más calmada whenever you want.
you're good already.
yeah.
and then I gave her the other eight patients.
and then I go to her.
and then she goes.
ah.
mal trabajo.
no no no no no pero yo no entiendo.
and I'm like.
like I looked at her.
and I'm like.
Selena si tú quieres se lo das a Pedro.
you know her assistant.
and I was like.
se lo puede dar a Pedro.
y que él te lo filee.
and then she just turned around.
and she goes.
here Pedro véame esto.
ay.
y él dijo y él dijo.
entonces le dijo así Selena.
yo te lo hago ahora.
or I'll do it for you first thing in the morning.
you know to put it to the side.
mmhm.
so it was funny because that's the way Selena reacted.
but then I went to Clara.
Clara had her own stack.
and Clara had one patient with one problem.
and I go up to her.
and I'm like.
Clara um estos eran los pacientes tuyos?
y éste éste de alante tiene algún problema.
and she is like.
a ver ya lo leyó?
she goes.
ah ok eso es facilito.
like she handled it with such patience.
the thing is.
I think she saw me
she saw the situation with Selena.
she saw how Selena had reacted to it.
so I think Clara is being smart in the sense of like I'm not gonna be a bitch.
I'm not gonna talk bad.
of course.
and not even that.
I'm I'm not gonna handle.
I'm not gonna look.
I'm not gonna look.
or like I'm gonna handle the job with ease.
do you get me?
so she looks at me.
and she goes.
hay uno solamente.
qué bueno qué bueno qué bueno.
and she like clapped her hand.
and then she goes.
qué bueno qué bueno.
and I just laughed.
and she was like.
yeah bueno.
um and here is the other.
y entonces estos estos otros no tienen problemas.
pero Iria quiere que tú lo filees en los.
and she goes.
ok mamita.
I'll do it right now.
it's no problem.
and then like today I had given her
because I terminé de revisar like two more patients.
I finished reviewing two more patients.
and I gave her the rest.
oh my god people keep calling my cell phone!
hold on.
Pamela I'm in school.
bye.
so then um
no le digas que estás conmigo que quiere venir para acá.
no.
no I I don't know.
she she picked up the phone.
and she goes.
you have to call me.
and I was like.
let me ask if it was an emergency.
entonces um she she handled it completely fine.
and then I gave her a.
I gave her some things to do today to Clara.
and she said.
sí mamita dame a mi to dame a mí todo lo que tiene que ver con mis pacientes que yo prefiero tenerlos en el.
y yo y yo tenerlo aquí todo.
like Clara handled everything so perfectly and smooth.
yeah but every time.
siempre me pasa lo mismo.
if I.
Abigail is it an emergency?
then what happened?
bueno.
and everytime I give.
Clara something.
she is always like.
ah ok ok ya lo escribo aquí ya lo escribo aquí.
thank you Ella.
ay estoy ahogada.
problemas.
a hablar.
y te preocupa por sus problemas.
y estoy ahogada.
tengo que hacer eso.
pero if he is the case.
él él no trabaja.
pero she is the case manager for those patients.
she is the case manager for those patients.
for those patients.
that's what she has her salary for.
that's what she's getting paid for so she needs to do her job.
just because she gets atareada just a little bit too much.
she like she does oh a little bit more work than than normal.
she already like she gets at she is I don't know she's she's learned to not be as rude.
but she's pretty rude.
I get she likes things her way.
and se hun se hunde en un vaso de agua si if if it's not her way.
yeah she's very rude.
she has to learn how to treat people because like everybody everybody after I hear Selena scream they come out through through the.
did you see what happened today in the morning?
ah.
ok.
you remember in the morning when you and me were sitting in the front?
and an goes.
puedo tengo que oír tengo que ver a.
puedo entrar?
remember that lady?
oh yeah.
yeah the law lady.
she went in.
bueno she went in.
and then like five minutes I went in also because I had to give something to Rosa to.
so I went in.
and I gave something to whatever.
and they were talking.
but they were talking kind of loud.
and then like two minutes later I go back into for a fax.
and Maria and were at it.
like they are screaming at each other.
so Marta and Maria have been at it.
el gato and Maria have been at it.
Martin and Maria have been at it.
everybody has been at it with Maria because she just doesn't know how to handle situations.
including me when that time when that time that she
oh yeah Maria and I had never been at it because from the beginning I knew that with that lady you have to have a little bit more than paciencia than everybody else.
she's rude.
she's rude.
I think she's very rude.
I think she just never learned people skills.
people skills?
yeah because when somebody cuando
exactly.
it's about no matter how mad you are you hold in your anger.
and you have some sort of modales.
do you get me?
you have modales like you office.
your coworkers.
screaming at people.
exactly tú tienes que convivir con la misma gente so why would you get in a fight with them or whatever?
exactly before before before you scream you could just talk.
and it's not that.
remember when Annie was her asistente?
but do you think these people.
everything's.
er.
maybe they are studying or something.
um
who cares?
do you wanna move somewhere else?
there are some mosquitoes here.
no mosquitoes.
oh you you wanna go to
oh no because the teacher said that she had to see us to come in and see.
but my class is right there.
and there's nobody in the class?
no.
let's go in the class then.
um
I think she's not in the class.
tú te acuerdas when Annie was Maria's case manager assistant?
yeah.
that Maria was screaming every five seconds.
to to to Annie?
yeah pero now she doesn't scream as much because she's talking to Jose.
she knows que se tiene que aguantar la lengua because Jose's a grown man.
of course.
do you get me?
but it's not even.
yeah.
it's beyond that.
it's beyond the fact that like
look in this way.
it's beyond the fact that like it's like.
it doesn't matter if I'm twenty years old or if I'm or if or if I'm thirty or forty.
exactly like you have to learn it because
you just
they're they're your coworkers.
they're not a kid.
I mean they're your coworkers.
from nine to five that person is your coworker.
and it's not even that.
they are not anything.
regardless it's like si yo fuera Annie I would look at her and be like.
tú crees que me puedas hablar a mí como si fuera persona please.
honestly.
er um but there's a lot of mosquitoes outside.
I know like we're getting bitten.
no but um but I thought I thought you weren't in here.
that's why we were like.
let's just go back.
oh.
oh ok.
no no no.
I feel bad.
I feel weird talking.
oh ok ok ok.
thank you.
yeah.
yeah.
uhuh so what were what were we saying?
no that when Annie was her her assistant her case manager que Maria every five minutes.
ay Marie.
she she always.
she always screams.
and it's just like you have to learn how to talk to people.
and you have to learn how to defend yourself as well.
because if I was in Marie's shoes I would look at her.
I feel bad now.
whatever.
if I was in Marie's shoes I would look at her and be like.
Maria tú crees que tú me puedas hablar a mí como una persona por favor?
no tiene que gritarme.
because they are a persona.
exactly.
like the one time that Maria has.
you can sit here.
you've never heard Maria scream at me.
and the one time that Maria screamed at me was porque she was trying to to printear un order.
y yo estaba faxeando.
so she's like.
ah.
so she was like ay.
ah oh yeah she does that all the time.
ay yo tengo que printear.
and I was like.
sí sí esperate un momentito.
déjame mandar este fax.
terminar de de mandar este fax exactly.
yeah and then she was like.
no no no no no no.
and I'm like.
Maria!
you got bit with a lot of mosquitoes.
I know.
uhuh.
I looked at her.
and I was like.
Maria.
esto es un momento.
es dos minutos más.
no no no no.
I was like.
Maria tú sabes que yo te entiendo más cuando tú me estás hablando.
cuando tú me gritas no sé qué me pasa en la mente que te bloqueo completamente.
you told her that?
yeah.
what did she say to you?
no that she was just like.
bueno que cuando termine
mira you brought a mosquito with you.
I know.
I'm allergic to mosquitoes.
I'm gonna have grey manchas all over myself right now.
um
and then that's it.
and you've never ever ever heard Maria screaming.
she's gotten better because Maria antes it was with everyone.
Maria had a problem with everyone at work.
este mosquito
está detrás de ti.
quiere ser mi hermano.
you know you're dressed in black.
black attracts more mosquitoes.
black attracts mosquitoes.
go for your shirt.
I know.
but I'm wearing jeans.
you are black.
I know I have one here now.
I have one everywhere see.
soy alérgica.
in Cuba it was really bad.
when I used to live in Cuba when I was a little girl.
mmhm.
ronchas all over all over all over my legs.
but in Cuba and and and those countries there's a lot more mosquitoes because todo es there's not there places are not A C.
everything is with the windows open.

and then August.
August is when when fall term starts.
so I have June and July.
pretty much how January
the same you are gonna be walking with kind of.
yeah you'll be you'll be fine.
no.
I'm not gonna be willing because I have my operation in in January.
January.
and by late February I was walking fine.
mmhm.
do you get me?
yeah.
so.
yeah that's the same thing.
you are gonna have June and July to
plus school doesn't start like the first week of August.
I have a little bit of August.
no it's just kind of late August.
yeah you have a little bit of August.
yeah.
to be able to completely
I can't wait man.
I wanna wear high heels.
I know.
but I think you should off for the high heels.
quiero bailar.
entonces um
neat boots fast cheap end of all.
everyone's boots dot com.
eso fue en Miami Dade también.
possibly yeah.
yeah that could just be any.
how much does a term in F i u cost you?
about.
how many classes do you take?
exactly if we are gonna take all four classes it'll cost about a thousand and
I think it was six hundred more or less.
ok it's a hundred dollars per credit.
a hundred dollars per credit.
and then each class is more or less worth three credits.
like English is worth three credits.
and math is worth three credits.
do you get me?
yeah.
but um like let's say that semester that I took it the the freshmans arrived or whatever.
that wasn't worth.
that was only worth one credit.
do you get me?
so let's say you are taking four classes.
um so four times three each one being three credits that's twelve credits.
times about a hundred that's about a hundred a thousand two hundred más o menos.
and then you have to then pay all the fees.
the parking fee the fee.
I don't have that fee yet.
yeah.
I don't have that fee.
and then it comes out to like I guess a little less like a thousand five hundred or something.
well for me it's a thousand flat.
everything for five classes was a thousand flat.
and that's five classes.
um wow.
that's what I paid last year.
it's a thousand flat.
wow that's good.
nine hundred and ninety nine dollars and like seventy six cents or something like that.
it's good.
yeah.
the F I U.
I paid that out of my pocket.
I had a I had a savings account.
I paid for my for my Miami Dade term half of my car.
yeah.
and that's it.
and then my mom paid the other half of the car.
and that's it.
and my dad didn't help with squat.
that's not good.
um
that's how it is.
but I was gonna tell you the the thing here er ok.
Miami Dade is setenta dólares por crédito right?
I think so.
yeah and here it's just a hundred.
well.
so it's about thirty?
times twelve how much is that?
but that's what I'm saying.
por qué tú no fuiste al Miami Dade two years before coming here?
I don't know I just came straight over here.
I'm gonna do my I'm gonna.
finish.
practically like saving money.
it is saving money.
just came straight over here.
Carlos was here and.
I like the school.
oh that's true.
that's true.
I'm gonna have to come to this school.
he he guided me through it.
the school
the school parece a little bit more confusing than Miami Dade.
no you get the hang of it.
I know I'll get the hang of it because when I first saw Miami Dade I was.
oh my god this is so confusing.
ah you see Miami Dade seems too confusing to me.
not confusing.
but it's seemed like a jail to me.
jail?
yeah.
no.
because it's just the buildings.
this class is ugly compared to the classes I had in Miami Dade.
the buildings are too like gray.
only outside.
this is this is just this is a small class though to be honest.
English classes are put in a really small class.
most of our.
all my other classes I ever had even my math class which is right in this building but towards the other end they're all big classes like auditorium like
even if it's just for a hundred students.
but they're the type that you walk in.
and they have like steps.
you get me.
that you go up and then
that's how all my classes are.
the only classes that have been really small always have been my English classes.
bueno.
all the other ones are like those types.
so the reason I like Miami Dade es porque.
I just don't like how the building looks.
F I U have a lot of arts.
and like the buildings look prettier and like.
ah a mí no me importa eso.
huh I don't look at it.
and and Miami Dade has like
but it gives you more environment.
Miami Dade has like arts stuff too.
pero what I like is on the side of the building has a really big four or three or two.
oh it's one of those.
it's one of those where where ever you need to go.
yeah it's building four.
exactly.
and then you just find the room inside.
well it's building four like lets say four two zero five.
it's building four second floor fifth room.
yeah.
yeah exactly.
that's the way it's split up.
so para mí que yo soy un poquito ah retrasada.
acelerada.
em that's easy.
porque if it's building four entonces eh parking here.
building three and parking here.
and in between each building parking there's a little parking in cases there's not space.
and.
.
I always find space close to my class.
parking.
no parking is very very difficult.
extremely difficult honestly.
you have to be here about
like I'm really used to this.
I really know like I just go into the garage.
and I go to the fifth floor because there's always gonna be parking there.
but it's pretty difficult.
and takes before like freshman freshman year but the first semester I ever took here I never had such a hard time parking.
but that's because I wasn't like.
and I would get there way early.
like I'll be at school like an hour half an hour before my class.
and it's just like I didn't know to early.
just don't bother looking for parking right.
fifth floor.
can use the elevator.
no no no for me is leaving in like lo que tenía que esperar era cinco minutos.
and somebody left.
somebody always left.
and all I have to do.
no.
and then the buildings here there're just.
they's not by numbers.
but they're by names.
they're like this this building here is the chemistry and physics”.
ah I know.
but when you've.
this is a chemistry and physics building with an an English class inside of it?
yeah.
yeah.
cause they're using it as an English class you know?
this is obviously a lot of other things.
