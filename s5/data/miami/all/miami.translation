and as I'm not looking for a replacement.
today is his day.
so I'll go.
he won't go
and that's it.
last week's managers weren't feeling sick.
it can happen to you any day.
well, now it's backwards.

what?
let's go inside so that, here outside there are lots of bugs.
more.
and here it's, like, a collection of bugs.
OK, but.

I think here inside there's a closed section to say there's a sort of plague.
look, with the, with the door closed there, there was, like, like, one
one what?
one that'll neither come in nor out.
unless they're those I'm killing right now.
yeah, and more.
right.
while outside.

oh no, you're already changing the story on me.
you told me.

I told you
yes I can.
yes, otherwise it makes me a little.
but you tell me
yes I can

yes, of all the days the one most, the one I most could.
well I can other days.
but from there on everything depends on,.

I can't go to court on Friday
no, yet you have to go.

because if show up.
they'll suspend your license, or something like that.

it's no problem.
just imagine.
there, yes, you'll have to get some.
and look how.
there are.
I.

how long have you been the same?
besides, I don't understand why I always have to put up with everything.
the only dumb.
no, the only person, that's all.
you don't have to specify or anything like that.
the only person that has to



my mom, today I'm really not going to go to work.
oh, tomorrow I'm not going.
why?
ah, just because.
oh, but you know what she told me.

tomorrow is Thursday, right?

do you know what she told me?
tomorrow the clinic.
she has to pay with the credit card.
that she wasn't going to go to work.
she was going to leave early.
so.
how am I gonna make it to this class and to the Statistics one?
work then.


OK
I remember.
because she told me.
well, honey.
so, not because you're supposed to give me orders, but you do have that silly title of manager.
that's how she told me.
well you know what?
she told me:

that she wasn't going to come tomorrow.
well, that she was going to come.
just because she knows I don't have anyone who can cover her position.
to cover.

she said she no go, that didn't have anyone who could cover her.

and then she said:
but since I know that they don't have, then I'll come but very early.
so you better get someone
or you stay here alone
well, but, no no

can't just not show up like that.
it's that on Friday I have to leave from there at two.
I might get there in good time.
that's why.
and I have to take clothes and stuff.
the whole thing.
I'm not going to like that girl.
why not?
or what?
so
don't eat.
high heels and t-shirt.
why do you dress properly in the of
what do you mean with properly?
because there are ten people.
the only thing there is there are disgusting people, nothing else
why disgusting?
the, the house is next-door to.
the the from there is a heavy atmosphere.
oh, if you don't want to go with me, it's your problem.
no, no, it's not that.
but go, go casual.
OK, no, but I'm not going to go smelly.
and it's not that I don't want, and it's not that I don't want to go.
has just replied.
I told you:
if I can, yes, otherwise no.
and well, but I'm not going to be smelly in the subway.
so, how little you know me.

eh?
no, no under which conditions?
this is called you and me talking in front of the radio.
not at all.
the professor stands up a maximum of five or six, minutes.
and at the court she thinks you're going to introduce.
no, like, yeah, and in the court I don't have to go through.
they won't check me.
I don't have to go in from some place.
I mean.
they are going to check you.
what things you're going to take through.
you're going to go through one of those things.
everything through a scanner.
right, then the person that scans everything is not close to me.
so what?
the smell!
that smells.
you told me yourself:
you smell horrible at the subway
I don't understand.
so what?
well, I'm not gonna go to a court.
I don't know.
it seems illlogical to me.
you are going to miss out on the journey from that side to come to this side.
what?
you are already on this side.
I don't see here.
it's not logical that

well, you take a sweater with you.
whatever.
and you change.
that's why.



hello.
I'm at the university.
at this very moment I'm being recorded.
because.
because I had the date.
because I had the date supposedly at half past five here.
I'm talking with
tell him to explain to you.
it's an English thing.
it's a project that
they're doing something there to see
how Hispanic people communicate.
they're doing, like, some sort of Spanglish.
so there we are.
Nat is here with me.
and they're recording us right now.
oh, OK.
at the moment they're recording me.
and I'll go off directly to the university.
why?
because I first had to start studying because today I had an exam.
and second, because later on I actually have a class.
and going home just in order to have to come back afterwards and come up here.
so that's why.

I won't tell her.
oh, such a pity.

because.
and because it stresses me out.
no, but it doesn't matter.
OK, later.
do you know what she told me?
what?
well, because from there I came directly.
oh, yeah, I can imagine.



of my house.
what?
if I go to work with your mother.

oh, yes.
what?
mmhm, right.
why?
I'd rather be dying from starvation.
which is the?
I'm not capable.
what.
when it's your turn, it's your turn.
that has she ever stayed to sleep at your house?
who?
's girlfriend.
you were going to ask that.
how many times have I told you yes.
I wouldn't dare to stay there.
she stayed there for months practically.
I wouldn't dare to stay and sleep there.
no less.
I mean, I slept there once with you.
but no one noticed.
and we were fast asleep.
but it wasn't our fault.
there's no, no difference at all.
no dare.

personal stuff.
I wouldn't dare to watch there.
and I would start, like, to pay a monthly fee.
you would start what?
I would start to pay a monthly fee.
I wouldn't dare to
why?

each silly thing.

of course, yes.
I
it can already be seen.
I would buy
when was that?
the other day.
the day I was trying to call Laurie.
when I was with Estefano.
that was a Saturday, right?
a Sunday.


nothing, he just didn't answer back.
I knew she was with.

so I called.
and he didn't answer either.
and I said:
yes too.
and I called Manuel.
neither of them aswered.
God knows what they're up to.

God knows what they were doing
so.
has just picked up and
and talk to her.
talk to her.
and talk to your dad.
or whatever for the same, the same, the same
well
anyway, it's just as I told you baby.
what.
it doesn't help me at all that they're always telling me that I should be the one who has to do more hours than everybody else since I am the manager.
it doesn't do me any good.
of the hour.

but in order to put up with them.
all day long my mom

oh my God, no, no, no, if she doesn't know how to do anything, oh.
but you come here to do nothing.

so besides that I can tell my dad.
the best thing my dad can do is to accept my conditions.
meaning that I say to my dad:
look, it's better if I find a person.
if you understand me.

but it's just that, it's, it's, or that.
that, that.
or that.
or that your mom.
two.
because the two of them together don't.
that's what I'm saying.
assume that she's in her own world.
she's into something else.
OK night.
yours.
or.
I have the, opposite, because it just doesn't work.
home.
it can't be.
of that swap constantly.
one of the two persons.
and that one of them, you or her, are the ones who that.
no, but it's that my mom is never going to learn how to use anything.
no, baby please.
the one who wants it does it.
but I've told her in our that we we're going to talk.
she didn't want to.
she didn't want to, she didn't want to, period.
believe me.
ignorant.
oh, well, but if, said that she knows English.
and she likes computers.
she's not able to.
she's not able to.
or she just doesn't feel like.
perfectly well, if, if they had wanted to, they would've done it.
don't you think?
otherwise to them.

could be.
that I'm not recording you.
you're not, then what are you doing?
that rudeness of that young lady.
of your girlfriend.

young lady.
things.
that's the best thing.
to get a part-time job which will give me enough to pay them for the car.
and to put some gasoline in the to come here.
and that.
well, so much that.

as much as goes in it.
well, gasoline to, to, to get to work.
or to put some in yours so we can come here.

as if I needed to.
simple.
just something silly.
I don't know.
not to evade them.
and that's it.
that.
no, because it's that with my mom nothing ever gets organised.
I don't know.
what can I tell you?
don't tell me anything.
it's like that.
I can't see.
your sister?
oh, the office?
Melanie, mmhm.
we have to say Laurie work.
not.
call, call the number.
and you'll see.

both things.
because there are and.
that's why.
because I've created

yes, I've created.
in Laurie Valdez.

you still have more.
you have, you have, you have it there.
four, look.
there are two here.
plus two more.


no, there are more there.

late there.

you don't go to.
right.
well, English.
I was talking to you in English.
who told you that?

ok ok so that, these are new, right?











everything is the same because we switched it from Citizens to Universal



then




right no
yes everything was together

well everything was together but I for the past couple of things I did not send that.
I did not send the contract

that's why in in the faxes that I was receiving that like came in
that's why they are requesting them
exactly


ok he only has one one thing so we would do him in the thinner folders.






yeah she she just said yeah to start.





so there you are, you know here it is all together.

yes yes, when it is time to look for it, it's ok

we're and now it's going to be individual.





and then ok so then we'll do that.



and then this is going to be separate because it's in another folder.





so pretty much I think that was all this.

this was formed
horrible mess
horrible mess


but well that that that is and then I will.

, I will tell you.
then this also this will have to be opened in a commercial folder.




yeah but, but if it's like that one, which is just a GO, we do it at the end so as not to get the

yes, but not the big ones.


yes only that they have like everything like homeowners insurance, dadada, whatever flood.




then nothing is Julia Pérez.


but
aha
so this is signature and the processing of the thing.

so all is in finance.





these these are the the problematic ones.
ah so they had to rewrite them.
all?


when it was done when when the problem was fixed she forgot normally.
aha.
and a month went by.
everybody took cancellation.
and and the and they did not have the explanation in?

no.
there was nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
yeah yeah so imagine Friday here.

how was the?

then these are for the contracts to do that.









so this one only has to be copied.
and send it again.


















Mayra or Tina.
these were not new.
there were some that were put

here.



that telephone.







yes Ricardo Hernandez is here somewhere on here.




and I did not write it.








unless it's but what

ah because it was there reserved.
oh how funny you are.
look they're super cute.

I saw it in black.
in this color they did not have.









of course.







it has been years since I have gone to Sawgrass because it's so far for me now.



so I used to go for lunch.


and after I moved forget it that's it.




because when I have a lot of them.
but when I take one that's the one that I wear for like ih.
me too me too.
but you know what it is for me?
at least I find that in my closet they're not organized so that I can actually change them.
you know I have to take down the box change my purse then I don't feel like changing it.
I bought um a little bookshelf those like Tupperware that has two drawers.
aha







no, I am the same.
I, when I choose one forget it.

















no because like
no I have the little ticket, we're gonna go maybe this afternoon.




yes, no, I thought about it the other day.




but since I wasn't here.










so this is the only new one?
this is only new.








yes nothing more ok.

so this I will



aha
and I put this here to do that.

so then these things are new.




ok and that one I think was already here yes?

this.




this I saw it here also.
let me see which is the
a new employee.


he is here coloring.
he loves to paint.



then let me see what else I need to do.
I have been talking for eleven minutes.
I.











you know he he he has that black thing there.




I tried I was like rubbing it but no.
so no no he goes.

and there was three of them because it was him the brother and Selina's son.




aha exactly.
yes I am going to make the copies.


you see that it is why I am asking you




but




so I put the phone number on the same piece of paper.
but I have to send the picture to them.

exactly because that is the message so she's aware of it.




then this I have to figure out what this is.


no idea honey.

I don't think so honey.

did you already eat lunch?
well but you are coming you are coming at a at a decent?








four o'clock.

but why if it's in I I don't understand if it's in you know





but how do we know that?









yes because supposedly we had a code or something which was what what we sent them.
or this.

but where is it?



yes I doubt it.
and it was only a twenty eight thousand building?


the only thing that I'm thinking is that she did that preferred that the preferred is in an x zone.

I don't do that.



don't you think?
no.
I think I simply do it for, if I have a party or something like that


but not because I need to, you know, do it always.
I've never done it, I've never done it.

parties, without parties I've never done it.
no?

but right now you were telling me that you like it and you think is nice.
well, look, for other people, for other people, not for me.
I don't care, I don't care.
so let's say











I'm always nervous.
yes?
always.


and that kind of nervousness, why is that?





no, my nails, no, nothing.

nothing, it has to do nothing with my nails.
it seems you worry a lot about the nails.
no, I, yes, no.
and how do you dress?
sorry.
I dress normally.

like military-style and everything.
that's not related with the nails.

the one to whom we were going to do that thing at home.
now I can't figure it out.

ah.
what was his name?

Troski, what do you think about Troski?
yeah, that one, that's a
fag
that's what I was going to say, but
let's drop that.
he used to do his nails a lot
he did the
yeah, he's quite
yes, I think so.
so what you think is that those who do their nails are
no.
no, I know what you're going to ask me, no.
it lacks taste.



so, in a manner of speaking, you don't support manicures.



so, if right now that lady over there comes over and tells you
hey, I want to take give you a manicure and pedicure
it's OK.
would you do it?
not pedicure.

not a pedicure.
but yes, they are nails after all.

I don't care about that either.

from the 80's.
and do you have over there?

those are modern shoes, I have too many shoes there.
so?

I'd would to sell them.
I'm interested in this.
about what?
a rack of these for wine.
because I see here that you only have three or four bottles.
and you get like a hundred and fifty, don't you?
well, most people are bringing what they a present to all my friends.
ah, exactly what you told me before.

do you know how many brands there are there?
why would I care?

that doesn't cost fifty dollars.
you are not materialist.
no.
OK, imagine.
that's not just picking one, blowing and making bottles inside.

that's it, we'll have to talk about something.
I'll give you, I'll get you one.
I'll try to get you one because.
look look.
you tell me, get me one.

I've tried to get that as well.
I couldn't do it.
what did you do to get it?
it wasn't easy.
no.
it was a friend that had one, had some of those.
OK.
and he doesn't have any more?
and what, what do I get if I get you one of those?

when we do a close we'll open one of the bottles.
OK?
I'll try the wine thing.

no, I'm not interested.
that's not just blowing and the bottle gets made.
no, look, look, if there's a close, I'm buying the wine.

which one?


that size won't fit into my house.
uh?
I don't have space in the house.

it would fit by the stairway.
nah.




but you can say that it's for the garage.
so you don't like it for inside the house.







rustic.
I that's why I like it, because it looks rustic.
but you know
it doesn't look fine here.
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

whatever.
OK.
OK.





































we've been to















































































and the kids are all, you know, Chinese types.



that was, they said there was, like, forty thousand motorcycles there.









we.



















































she's always complaining that.
you always want to stay in the club.
you don't want to go to any other place.
you don't want to ask.





she gets, she gets sick all night.

on, and Friday night they get, you get to eat a complete.





a lot of times with a dessert.


you can buy a bottled water












they put on the attorney of the club.





filled up.

all video of, for karaoke and all kinds of songs.




and then after ten we put the volume up on the the system of the club.



so then they, we made an agreement that the the music's down low from seven to, until ten o'clock, it's.

and then she starts dancing with the women from the club.



they're always dancing there.



and then later he starts putting on karaoke music.





the other night we went, we've had nights when we've left, like, at one, one thirty in the morning.




look, we did, we just went to

and then everybody wanted to go to Latin America to drink coffee and Cuban bread.


the, the
the party of the.



because we went to the Versailles.

the Versailles.
the Versailles is in the Thirty-seven.

right behind to Thirty-seven in front of the road.
that's where all the Cubans hang out.

where all the Cubans go to
it's the Eight.

the, after you pass the Thirty-seven, through the Eight.
where do they go?

it's the road on your, on the south side.
and Versaille is to the.

that's right.
after you cross over that way.
it's over there.

and we went there.
we, I think we were about twenty-five and we went there.
and you know because in the group there's always those who who are very active.











yeah, you should see, you should see how those old people like Liliana.









she's, she gets there.

yes, one called Ron.











yes, the gaucho.
he she calls him gaucho because he's Argentinian.
oh my God.
yes now after all the things, I gotta pay off some things that we have left now.
of her the girl.

for myself, I get scared for her to be on a bike you know.



hey, there, there so you can.






because a lot of people when they ride the motorcycles they believe that a motorcycle just by turning the wheel the motorcycle turns.








it gets crazy.
you brake sharply.



let me sit down here.
I'm better here.



and it seems that he got scared of the curve.

he stayed straight on the bike.
and, and what happens is is you do one of those like you know it makes you swerve like you're gonna fall off.


yeah that was before we became members of the club.
or actually it was just about three weeks before we became members of the club.
yeah, of the, before we.



and the problem is that he got scared of the bike.
now he's.
no, but you can't.
















so you, you know you're actually leaning the bike, but, you know.




yeah she

now I'm not scared of it.


we went to Saint Augustine too.
oh, Saint Augustine, we love it.





Liliana followed us in her car with Ana.

crazy girls.

just imagine, they gave them an honorary diploma.
to her and Ana.


they gave them an honorary diploma
I'll show it to you.
from the club, for attending in the trip.
and the two crazy girls were going, through the sunroof taking pictures.















now just for competition.









actually last weekend I was signalling by putting out my foot to show that there was a dead otter in the middle of the road.













we're doing almost seventy miles an hour, just think.



that the the older guys, they were all cracking up because when we came back it was still there.

I'm sure that's the otter.
in Spanish it's "nutria".
I'm sure that that otter is saying.
fuck, they ran over me and killed me.
and now she's coming at me with a potato.
fuck, anywhere I go he's there.

oh dear.


no my darling.





I think it was smaller.
you?


I was going to, I didn't cross with the.





yes it's true.





he's crazy.

but then, he gives you the you know, just cracking up all day.

it's all sheer madness.










he can't be more.





not more, she is in her fifties.


no, Maria is fifty something.
no, Maria is not that that.
not fifty something.

she's already


what's happening is that she's a when she was young she must have been very pretty.

little.

yes.
she's always well-dressed.
yes.
so she looks very well.



whenever we have a Hallowe'en, Saint Patrick's Day any
they wear a wig on Saint Patrick's.
she's got a green wig.
she has a green wig.
for Saint Patrick's Day with her hair like that, and then a green necklace.
once in in a costume party she went dressed like Saint Polly girl.
for Hallowe'en, I'll show you the pictures.
Ricky dressed up like the angel and a devil.







but he was walking around laughing.









but we
it's just there.
everything is there.
everything is there.
everything is there, look.


did you hear?
and the.
you have to put it on the plate.
and now, and now they wanna do
and heat it up on the plate.











and some men that were alone.
it's like everything.
well, first you ride, like, we didn't know anyone in the club.












but they began to get involved in that in

we have, we have issues in the club that have to be worked out.
but I'm pretty sure everybody has issues, you know.







that, yeah, there's people that don't want to pay their membership.













and then, like.

everybody, you can take snacks and cakes.







there's a lot of, there's a lot of, like, we went to Eighth Street this weekend.



in Eighth Street.



















but they, they, you know, the president of the club, no, you know, he's real politician.

but the same thing happened, we had a camping trip.

























sit down there, my darling.








have you helped yourself to, have you heated up the rice and the steak?


have you bought maize?



and I, and the president had to wait for him all day until they took his out with a crane.





and imagine, we had terrific music with her playing.








don't give her any, she has already eaten.


and then he was talking all kinda junk.




and he's really, what a guy, it is obvious that he's such a bore.



















you get your, whatever it is, rice, a plate full of food.






yeah, they can donate meatballs, lasagna, depending what they do, you know.

with yucca and roast meat.
the other day there was a woman who is Spanish.
and she did, I think she's from or, whatever they do
Spanish people.

with white rice

what else did they do?































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































yes, no.



























































































what do you want me to do for you?

no, it's ok.
there is no problem.
because I've been suffering headaches.
with hardware that is not properly made.
no headaches, but still.




I brought something to eat.
I brought something to eat.
that not that Indian person who doesn't go anywhere?
wait until he weighs twenty pounds.
he is a
there is nobody who can
yes.
why, and why doesn't heshe want a pram?
it's a car.
if she carries that baby all the time

I was also given one of those.


no, yes, exactly.



it is money. It is a
yes, a good thing you can give is a gift certificate.
and then she can buy whatever she wants.
and if she wants to carry that
and if he is sleeping
and he is in the car seat
you are not going to get a sleeping baby out of the car seat.
my grandmother used to say.
do not wake up the lion.

oh a put it in the pram.
and it doesn't need to be one of those that is specially designed, because I used to






not even
what
everything weighs in this life.
she is so
no, she won't be able to work.
can you imagine the day she has to find a day care?
well, that's why she wants to move up there, to the ecofriendly department of Oregon or Seattle, or wherever that is.










































what did I bring?
a salad I made.
the other day.
I have here quite a lot, if you want to taste it.
one of those that is layers
I made it for Easter.
what was left over.
let's see.













it's like a layer salad, that starts at the bottom with lettuce and stuff.
and afterwards

you need to get a bowl that is kind of transparent, so you can see it.

and it has



my mother in law made it for Christmas.
she brought some to my mother's house.
she brought salad.
and no.
for Christmas eve.

that she was at the hairdresser's.



and then the dressing on top, and I've found a couple of different

and there was another one that was mayonnaise with sour cream.
and then I added a few spices.
salt, pepper.

yes.

but they gave me the
they take you for two dollars?
bloody hell!
for two fifty.
they take me.
and two fifty for the return.

bloody hell!
for five dollars they take me wherever I want to go.
return, isn't it?
and a little tip?

seven dollars and that's it?

but they gave me the phone I should dial,
and they gave me the wrong number.
and I have to ask Luisa for it, as she's got that service.
because Pepe has offered to take me.
you see, he offered to take me to see Susana.



yes.
but you stay overnight, you stay.




then
and I feel ashamed that I have never again
only once I've gone to see her.
the marmalade of
Billy brought for me a box of mangos that a friend of hers had given away, so that she would make marmalade for her.

I made the marmalade for her.
and I threw it away eventually.
because it was in the fridge for more than a year.

I wouldn't bring that to her.

and I wrote to her

two jars.
but one should use one of mango.
but is?
do you put the whole mango in boiling water?
no
I put them in the blender.
I peel them.
I cut them into pieces.
I place them in the blender.
with milk or water, or what?
eh?
with milk.
with what?
ah, ok, so
no, I don't add milk.
don't you?
it's pure mango.
without water or anything?
that's why it tastes of mango so much.

it's pure mango.
but it has to be made in the blender.
and then sieve it.
then, afterwards, you add the sugar.
and when it thickens, you put it in a jar.
but I couldn't go to see her.
and they went off in the fridge.
I had to throw them away.

Lini brought a box of mangoes for me.

and from a box of mangoes you made only two jars?
I wasted around fifteen mangoes.


and big mangoes.
but fifteen mangoes gave you nothing more?


look, they were this big.
and were they sweet?
big and very tasty.


a friend of hers that works in the court, with your sister, gave them away.
do you know that my mango tree doesn't even have the stump left anymore?
it
it
yes, I've already seen they had cut it, right?
that.
Susie got two dark-skinned workmen from our district.
and they knocked down our shed.
we don't have a shed anymore, or that
all that jungle we had in the back, they removed everything.
yes.
yes, I saw it.
but listen to me, that mango tree that was dead when I brought it from your place.

it's alive.



bloody hell!
look, if we'd known it we'd have brought it.


because I have a thing.
because I need
I need to plant it.
you don't know how to plant it.
I have a thing, with three spikes like this, that is like a spade.
that I think, well
one can pick it up
and put it in the earth
and do this
and make a hole this way, you know?
yes.
then, you put it in the earth like this.
no.
and that's it.
to be honest I am not curious about this shit.
no, I know, no, no.
and one needs to know how to plant.
you plant the tree.
you have to size the hole depending on the roots that it has.

then you put good earth on top, like the one I buy, Miracle Grow.
then you put good earth on top.
you put Miracle Grow all around it?
on the other side too?
yes.
of the hole?
yes, because so that below, with, where the root is going to be
and that comes already with its own fertilizer.
yes.
yes.
and cat shit doesn't work?
yes.
no.
shut up!

no way, no.
then, after you've put on Miracle Grow, you put there that thing.
so that it stands upright.
and you add more "Miracle Grow" on top.
water.
as soon as the hole is made, first thing is to add a bit of water.
water and then Miracle Grow
no, this way.
and then the tree.
and then water again.
after the Miracle Grow, water.
and then you can add any kind of earth that doesn't have vitamins or anything.
have you grown tomatoes a lot?
ah, once in New York.
but when you obtain the fruit, or the vegetable, or whatever.
it is ready.

usually.
and you pick it up.
do they give you more later, or not?
no.
once you pick it, you fuck it up.
no, I know.

they can give fruit twice.
but it isn't
it's not constantly.
no.
like an orange tree?
like the strawberries when
in New York I bought forteen strawberry plants through the post.

not even one died.

and when we came here in eighty-two, there were more than fifty strawberry plants.
because they create their own offspring.
the strawberries grow a branch
that branch goes to
falls on the floor.
and right away it is another plant.

but listen, since I had strawberries, the man in the printing unit, the Italian one
yes.
the old man was putting his little hands through
through the bars.
through the bars, poor him.
and he used to say, he tells me

good morning.
and I used to say good morning to him.
and I used to say
look, go to work.
because he was on his own in the printing unit

he didn't have anyone to help him.
I used to say
go to work and when I have your
I used to prepare a little bag for him
and gave it to him.

listen, there is nothing fresher than that, right there from the vine, man.
ah, yes, yes.
but he used to love them.
oh my God.
and whatever I took upstairs, I used to make syrup for my mum.
Mum used to like it.
what did you make?
no, Mum didn't eat them like this.
you know.

er I had to put them in the blender.
to make a puree.
and I added sugar.
and I used to do like one
bloody hell, more sugar even than what the plant contains?
no.
because the strawberries
they were sweet, but they were not

no.
to make jam you have to add a bit of sugar.

then I would take the toast
and I would spread it on them like this.
fuck it, what a life.
she used to like that.
bloody hell, anyone would!
fresh strawberries were hurting her.

so you used to make strawberry jam?


yes.
be careful, because the rednecks over here, the hillbilly Americans, make this kind of thing all the time.
of course they do.

I know this, but I
of jelly, and of everything.
I needed to use as many of them as possible, because I had many plants.

out of the forteen that I bought, that was all those bits, I had picked them up from the plant.
and that's still a vine.
no.
no?
at all.
look, this is how much the little ones grow.
they don't climb on the walls?
not even two foot.
not even two foot.

bloody hell, then one needs to bend down to pick them up.
they are very low.
but how they give fruit!

you used to see them red all over.
but look, Juan let me down, because he told me that here they wouldn't

because here, of course, as soon as I sowed them, the worms were eating them.
if one doesn't have the earth aired this way
of course
but I am always adding
if I know I have ants, I put down something for ants, I buy something.
ok, and what do you put down for the ants?
a few sachets like this.
do you have ants there?

no, but I still have at home a sachet like this.
well, I have
the small ones come into the house all the time just to, you know, mess with the grass
oh yes, those ones yes.
but I am speaking about the big ants, the red ones that you
that bite like hell.
do you get the bites infected?

because I get them infected too.
I can't with that
I see one
and I get goose bumps.
I even follow them to see where they are hiding.
to see where they have their nest.
no, because I have a man who comes, the cockroach guy.
and, and
oh, who kills all those, yes.
and through hallway of the house, and inside, and outside
yes, but
yes, but where I live
it's a fucking good poison, man.
yes?
as soon as you apply it, they are already dying, those faggots.
yes?
as soon as you apply it, they are already dying, forget it
no, I don't
listen, something else: is Ellen scared of those cockroaches?
oh yes.
bloody hell!
listen, one day she phoned me crying.
no way.
and screaming?
and screaming.


I told her
look, kill it!
get a broom.
and kill it.
then, don't you know what she said?
that it was in the kitchen, and that she couldn't use the broom.
I told her
well, use anything then.

no.
use anything.
what a coward, with all that shit, boy.

don't you know that one day I came round
no, but I'll tell you something: that one day
when Juan was a undercover, when we were living in 134, er, our father and I got up one day
and we saw Juan sleeping on a mattress in the living room, on the floor of the living room.
and I told him

what are you doing there, boy?
why are you here?
I got scared.
he told me
not any more, because, look, I am not going into that room anymore
I'm not going into my room anymore, because there was a cockroach walking on my bed
who was that, Juan?


your brother, Juan.
well, I didn't find it strange.
already a man?
surely, if he was undercover.

when
what a faggot!


no, then I told him
and, like, that son of a bitch.
boy
yes, now he laughs.
then look, I'm going to tell her so that he feels embarrassed.


so that he feels embarrassed.


can you?
look, yes.
remind me.
you know, I told him, he said
Mummy
and don't make me get into bed.
don't make me, you and dad, don't
don't make me get into bed, please, because I am not going to sleep in that room any more unless you kill that cockroach.
unless you kill it?
yes, me

oh well, he had to leave for work.
then he left
yes.
and I said
I've been looking, Tito
I've been looking
and I don't find the cockroach.
imagine.
but it was a big one.

the big ones.
then I said
Tito, I can't find it.
I'm already bored with looking for it.
he told me.
look, do you know what you can do?
you go, we go to the corner
where they put the dry leaves and that kind of thing?

and there, you know, do you remember that you used to move it to pick up the rubbish and they always came out?
because that was a cockroach nest, there.

then, I said
oh yes, it's true.
I picked up one.
I killed it.
and I put it over there.
and I told him I had found it!
and you pulled his leg, then?
oh yes, but he doesn't know.


until tonight, he won't know it.

poor him.

oh yes.
you fooled him a bit.
yes.

listen, and that was laughing.
because your father used to like those things.
sure.
I hadn't thought of this.
I knew I had to find one, find the damn cockroach he saw
and kill it.
but I didn't see it.
I didn't see it.
no, no.
that was because
and well, as soon as he thought of that, we went
we did it.
and I said
oh well, then shall we try to bring
imagine, in that house that every single time there was a coming round.
anything.
anything, yes.
and I was going to feel embarassed if they saw that mattress laid out on the floor.
no, then I picked it up.
and we put the mattress
I made the bed again, and that was it.
when he arrived, I said
look, look at him
ah, and he was so happy.
you'll see tonight!
maybe he'll get annoyed me.
but I fooled him
look, and now he speaks so much about Ellen
that day she phoned me to complain about him.
she phoned to complain about him
about him?
whatever.
yes, because he was already
but I told her
listen, pick up a broom.
and kill it.
then, she said
yes, but I can't pick up the broom because it is in the kitchen.
and I don't know where she was hiding
that is
I think that was the day that she picked up a box and threw it upwards.
she hit it a knock
but she didn't kill it.
it was still moving a little bit.

those ones are easy to kill, aren't they?



and who did that?

no way.


honestly!
she was panicking so much that I went to her fucking house.
she was panicking so much, silly woman.
unbelievable.
unbelievable!
no, well, but Billy is the same, Billy blushes all over.
no, no, no, no, Billy.
a lawyer was humiliating himself in order to work with them.
she looked up, like this, in the office, and saw a dead roach inside the glass there
there
she said
until you haven't sorted this out, I won't come here anymore.
the lawyer tented the entire building in order to kill all that shit.
so that she would be satisfied, look

it cost him thousands of dollars to do that.

ah, look!
that was another good one.
that, then, no but she blushes all over.

all her skin gets covered of red streaks, poor her.

the truth is that no

what a pity.
no, but there, they were the American, the German ones, they used to call them.


yes,
and it was due to the neighbours downstairs.
as soon as the little lame woman moved in, the cockroaches in my house and all over the green area disappeared, because it was the little lame woman's apartment and ours.

and then if I tried to do things to kill them.
they went off downstairs.

and afterwards they'd come back, and so.

and no

but she told me
she was the one who had the idea
she said
Luisita, when you

yes.
you do it at seven one day, and you warn me
and then I do it in my house.
and this way we'll put an end to them.
and we finished them off.
there weren't not even in the hall could you see one of those.


they disappeared completely, thank God.
but that woman had to move in, so that I wouldn't have a
because it was horrible to get rid of them


they were terrible.
horrible, horrible!
no, thank God I've been living there for 17 years.
and they never leave me alone.
now the big ones come in when it rains.

when it rains.

when it rains enough.
there.



because the sewer system has them in there, because

I've never seen them over there
they put it there.
they put it there.
the only way that a cockroach, that cockroach can come into my house without dying
because in the flat, all over the flat, I, they put the poison, two months
yes.
if I find a good healthy one in my house it's because it came in through the sink.
I'm telling you.
no, through the sink not.
I have seen them coming out of the sink.
I go earlier.
you know, the thing that comes through the
not the one in the kitchen, but through the sink in the bathroom?

snakes come in.
it's happen to two people.

thanks God it doesn't happen to me

maybe from the toilet, but not from the sink.
because it hasn't
look, if people see them
they can't they can't swim there anymore.
small, small.
yes, yes, from the single bathroom.
a man called Alberto had one coming out of there.

and he nearly had a heart-attack.

yes, because he saw half the snake coming out.
he called the office.

and they came over.
and killed it for him.
and they said that it was a garden one.

but then a woman was having a bath
and from the bath hole came out one.
and what do you do?
no, I'd die.

no, I'd die.
or you'd break both your legs.
the day of the accident I had
because of that they couldn't take me by helicopter with Pablo.
because my blood-pressure was 315.

my blood-pressure is emotional.

and apparently after the fright, when I realised what had truly happened
because, like, I fainted and I didn't know anything
but when I saw all my car broken down, I said
oh no, then it was an accident.
when I came back, I came towards, where I was sitting, in front, with Pablo. I saw Pablo, who couldn't speak, nor open his eyes, nothing
but, why did I start talking about this?
because of the blood-pressure.
oh, because of the blood-pressure!
then when I was complaining, crying, I was telling the rescue man
two of you told me that you'd put me in the helicopter with my husband
and I don't want to be separated from my husband.
they told me
ma'am, you have such high blood-pressure we couldn't put you on that.

I said
how high is it?
because I didn't think
and you didn't feel anything?
no, no, when my blood-pressure increases I know straight away.
but that day I was so nervous and I didn't
and then he said
you have a blood-pressure of 315, ma'am.
and that was when I realised they couldn't put me the.

but no way!
it was terrible.
and the first of this month we were celebrating that we had been married for two years.
two years of, I know.

what a thing!

bloody hell!
yes, it was difficult.

hard.
I'm telling you the same I tell Susie
what the fuck, Susie, we've already been together for 26, 28 years.
married 26, and together 28.
you can already forget that, there is no remedy.

but I told her bluntly.
listen carefully.
if you go missing one day, either because of a divorce or death
I am telling you now, to your face, listen carefully to me
I'm going to Guatemala.
I buy 20 or 30 female goats, or male goats, whatever the fuck.
and I go to a farm over there, with a rancher who has a 19 or 20 year-old daughter more or less.
and I buy her.
oh no!

look, that is
that's a very offensive thing.
you can't buy a human being.
no.
wait and see!
no, no, no, no, no, no
but I would behave with her
no, look, one day
the only thing is that she can't watch the television, or speak on the phone, or speak with the neighbours, because otherwise

as soon as she knows about soap operas and shit and all that, there is no no, no.
no, man, no.
what do you think?
she's a human being.


the man that is left alone

look at Pablo, he was a widow for ten years.
that man was very thin and badly cared for.
he used to send all his clothes to the dry cleaner.
when he was going to wash them?
what?
because he didn't know how to wash them?
no, he didn't know how to put on the washing machine.
neither do I.
when, fuck, when Patty left me
no, look, López's wife was a very good woman.
that's why I, on the 20th March, when she celebrates her birthday, it would have been her birthday, wouldn't it?

because she was born on 20th March.
I go to the cemetery to take flowers, as earlier I
we always looked after her grave, because she was very good with him
she even cut the steak for him.

he had two hands.
but she, she, no, she used to cut the steak for him.
and she died of cancer, didn't she?
she died of oesophageal cancer.


he's an actor, a very good person.
he's called Patrick Swayze.
they say that he has pancreatic cancer.
oh, yes, that one won't last long.

he won't last long, because, look, when Rosana came from Cuba, on her last trip, she said in a letter that she had come with a pain, but that she'd be going the next day to the doctor.
when she had the result, she phoned me.
and she told me what it was.
it was cancer.
and the doctor told Pedro, who was, who is a doctor
ah, who is married to Rosana's niece
he said
if she was my grandmother, I'd give her money so that she'd go travelling, if she likes travelling, because she's got three months to live at most.
they rarely give them more than three months.
to any patient of cancer.
to any patient of cancer.
ah, that man you've said that has cancer now.
that artist.
he won't last even six months.
that's too bad, because he's a good person, the motherfucker.
he is not one of those who cause trouble and messes things up, you know?
yes, but it's, but it's pancreatic cancer.
the name?
the pancreas is what makes insulin.

that's why it's diabetics, when

so
eh, the pancreas, is, like
it's, like, cancer in the pancreas advances much faster.
it causes more pain than in other organs of the person.
because, for instance, if you get a bit of the liver affected.

they remove a bit.
and the liver grows back again.

but the pancreas doesn't.
and that man, I saw him yesterday on the television.
I don't think that he's going to last even six months.

he won't even last six months.
he says that the treatment is working, but
that's what the doctors say, but you know
yes.
I hope he lives for many more years!
Pablo's wife didn't last much.

no.
she went to the doctor.
when he arrived she told him that what she had, she told him that what she had was cancer
and she didn't even live four, not even four months she lived.
Pablo's wife?
how sad.
yes.
and he sold everything out, because he had a company
they had two of those, big ones, to mow the lawn
and they got quite a lot of money, but well
do you know that Pablo owned seven houses?

they rented them.
with all that, it seems as if they sold them.
and the son has kept all the money, and the house in.
but the house had already been transferred to the daughter.
some criminals.
luckily they haven't even phoned me.
I hope they don't bother me.
because I don't want to know any more about those people.
but the money I've already lost in that account, I'm going to go to court.
even if I go on my own.
because Juan tells me that it is a very bad neighbourhood
the court?
the same court where you got married?

no, I have to go to Flagler Street.

I went to the court, to the same court where I married Pablo.

but there they told me that they couldn't help me with that, but that they'd give me the address where I had to go.
that I had to go to the civil court.
and I said
but I don't know where the civil court is.
and they told me
look, I'm going to give you the address.
and he came with it.


so when Juan took me home, came home to take me to that court, he said
Mum, I've come to take you there.
but one thing: you get very nervous.
you know, as I was telling you today, when we were looking for a place to eat that night, and I saw so many dodgy people
because I don't know, I can tell by looking at people's faces.

and I saw many dodgy people.
you even told me that there were a few prostitutes.
sure.
I said
there, I'm going to be close to one like that, no way.
and I took that
I didn't say anything, when you told me that some of them were prostitutes.
I said
not there, not me.
but I didn't tell you anything.
but I had a feeling in my stomach, that the hunger went away.
you weren't hungry any more!
no, I didn't eat anything, I didn't eat anything.
no way!
I think I ordered an ice-cream.

no.

no, we went to a place where there were
a Pollo Tropical?

no.






stay there so I can watch you from the window.

and that was horrible.
that was a horrible night.
I lost all my appetite.
then he told me
you're a very nervous person, mum.
and you don't like the things
I don't like a neighbourhood like that.
I don't like walking over there.
it feels as if
it's not that they're going to do anything to me.
it's that if several people try something, I can't defend myself.
one on their own I don't mind.

but, yes, but not her.

but neighbourhoods, no
no, no, no, no.

no.




yes, but you were big.
and you had a truncheon like this to defend yourself.

I shot them, for fuck's sake.
bloody hell, I shot them, fuck.
they're going to learn bad words
listen, these days there is a sonofabitch wandering over there in Brooklyn.
he is completely fucked, so many times I've beaten him up.
yes.



no, once I had a Mace in my wallet.

and every single time, always that I saw someone who looked, you know, dangerous

yes, in New York everyone was wearing a coat, right?
and always with pockets.
I got out my Mace.
and I put it like this, in my pocket.
I used to say
if that lowlife comes at me to do something, they'll know who I am.


because it's not about what they might steal from me.
it is about what they might do to me.

because if they steal my things, I can buy them again.

but no, not if they knock me onto the ground.
look, two years ago, a woman where I live went to a Holy Rosary, the seven o'clock Mass.
and can you believe that two people attacked her, two men waiting for a poor elderly person.
I don't know, to tell the truth, how old she was.
but she was not young.
she lives in River.
so, then, they took some keys off her by force.
they were waiting for her, as she was about to open the car.
they attacked her there.
they took her wallet.
because she didn't want to leave her wallet, they knocked her onto the ground.

and they broke her arm in two places.

do you know how much that woman suffered?
and that's what I try to avoid, that they hurt me.
yes, like you told me once in New York.
Mum
don't use expensive handbags.
and it's true, because Rosana had up to 200 and something dollars or even 300 in a handbag, and they picked her pocket three times in
in the underground.
in the underground.
and the reason was that they saw the handbags were good ones.
they were expensive, right.
then they had to
one day they even stole an envelope with jewellery that she had.

there.
don't you know I had once that case, an old American lady
the same thing happened to her when she was going into her house.
they knocked her down.
then they stole her car.
they ran her over with the car.


look at her arm, here.
this arm is thicker than this one.
the wheel went over it.

and her arm burst.
it burst.
we were, it was all ripped forever.
probably she lost it.


she was, she was so old.
eighty-something she was.
and they run over her, with her own car, they run over her arm.

flesh, blood, everything went flying out like this.
criminals.
and that, it was all ripped like that.
criminals!
I felt so angry, bloody hell.
well, if I





that way, er, and Susie, eh Susie saw it.













and I was washing my armpits, no shit.

yes.


but what criminals
believe me, that woman suffered quite a lot, because imagine, two fractures within the same arm.
so
and when you already old, this is no, this is no joke at all.
this is no joke at all.
we old people don't heal easily, my son.
at most, a child that breaks their leg
is walking again after three months, as if nothing had happened.
because those bones are nice and young, they are
right, and they heal easily.
but old people don't
and I'm afraid for them.
look, on previous days.
like, I saw that things are getting so bad, even, even waiting for a bus, you're afraid that you might be grabbed and raped.

no, that doesn't have
there are so many women being attacked all over.
so I went to a place.
and I saw, like the one you gave me, that whistle you gave me in New York.

I bought one.

a copper one.
but it's

where did you get it?
in the Via Rica, in the Via Amiga Maria, next to it.


yes, a good make, made in England.
made in England.
then I'm going to clean it well, to put it on my thick chain.
and I'm going to add it on the thick chain I'm wearing now, you see?
her I'm going to
look.
here, as I have that everyday
then, if something happens, as I was doing with the Mace in New York, when I took it out of my handbag at once and held it.
I'm going to have it here, on this chain.
and I'll start whistling as if

no.
bloody hell!
at least trying to
because maybe the person will get scared, if you start blowing a whistle.
the person, you see?
I'm going to the command headquartes with some dogs.
no.
yesterday I was ironing in the living-room.
and like this, you see, the door is here and I was standing here ironing.

I heard something, as if someone had thrown something against my door.
it could also be the wind.
and I thought, no, I thought it was the cat, which had gone out.
but he never does this.
when I went to the window and I looked, the cat was not around.
I don't know what that was.



you feel the door, as if someone was trying to open the door.



it is really deceptive.
well, I went there straight away.
and I looked.
there was nobody, no.
there was nobody.
but it was different when I had Mac.
when I had the little dog, it barked straight away.
as always.
and you knew there was someone there.
but now, without the dog
let's see if one day
have you never seen Herbert Dole's dogs?
no.
Mum, they are really small, like this.
they are like Mac.
but they look like mice.
really?

listen, do you remember that woman who had a dog like that and I asked her if she was selling it?
and she told me no?
no.
this, this, after we left there you told me
that dog is worth 1000 and something dollars.



a black one, it looked like, it looked like yuppie's hair.
black and really small like this!
1400 dollars.

1400 dollars.

and its brother 1500.
and they had another little dog that was white, but it looked pink, pink, pink, pink.
yes.
and we said




because the icing of the cake was pink, was for a girl's birthday.
yes.



no, I'd like a small one.
but not where I live, because where I live I'd have to, I was going to
people are shameless, you know.
they pass by
one day I went out.
and I said
lady, you're not beside your door.
that dog shouldn't come over here without even a leash.
it's over that fence that your door is, so move on.
because if this dog does its business over here, you don't have anything in your hands to pick it up.
will you be leaving it there?
of course, what do you think?
no, no, it's not such a given.
you know in New York you have to go with a newspaper or with one


because that's not, that's not right.
that's not right.
it's not respecting other people.
no!
and I didn't see her any more.
she never passed by.


she never again went that way.
well, listen, there are fourteen buildings.
she'd better go to another building to act like that.

when I moved there
I still have those papers, I've been living there so many years
that they told me and your father, God rest his soul, look
you have to cross
people walk the dogs next to the highest fence
that eight-foot one.

so why isn't everybody told, so that everybody obeys that.
no, so they walk them over there.
because people do whatever they want, that's why.

no.
no, but that's a bit dodgy there.
do you think so?
yes, yes, yes.
look, when they told me that thing about the stove, I told them
so look, I am afraid of this stove.
I don't want to get electrocuted one day, or have an accident here.
because that is two twenty.


therefore I can get electrocuted with that.
no, I'm not going to clean that stove inside.
not inside any more, I just clean this bit you can see, clean.
I don't clean the rest, because the cables are there and
I'm not going to
no, no, no, no, no.
it's caught fire twice.

do you have something to measure in the house?
yes, I do.
and they told me it was twenty-three something.
but now when I take of that thing from Home Depot.
straight away he told me that he said that it was twenty-three something.
he said
yes, but this is a big stove.
he had already told me that Macy didn't have a small one.
in Sears.
that there were only big ones in Sears.
I said
well, if that's where I have credit.
then I went to Home Depot.
my son buys it in Home Depot.
and I could pay him whatever.
Home Depot don't have a small one either.

look at that.
where can you get one like that?
in BrandsMart.
the only thing is that well, you have to use a regular credit card to pay cash.
but they're cheap.
look, I've bought a freezer, right, the freezer I have at home at the moment.
well, no.
for less than 200 dollars.
a freezer like that.
but is that a new shop?

really?


oh, yes.
look, do you know what else I need?
the living-room television.
the living-room television.
it makes me sad.
it's a pity, because that television cost 400 and something dollars on a special offer.

and your bought it.
and how old is it?
your father bought it, two years, two months before he died.
he has been dead for three years, hasn't he?
that's it.
five.
already five?
bloody hell!
five years and two months.

thus, the television is seven years old.
or eight by now.
more or less six years.
well.
no, six years, yes.
and it's already causing problems, isn't it?
many times it switches itself on.
bloody hell!
we'll throw it away, like shit.
then I can't
I told that to Billy.
but he told me that one more year and that television might not be any good for anything.

then I said
well, then I won't sell it, I won't throw it away, because what am I going to buy another one like that which won't work for me in a year's time or less than a year?
oh, because of the HD and the digital bullshit and all that?

no, you have cable TV, don't you?
yes.



so, I was thinking of buying one of those flat ones.

yes, of the small ones, son, I don't want a big one.
bloody hell!
it's expensive, baby.

very 300, 400, 400 dollars easily.
well, 300, 400 and something I paid for the one that I'll have to throw away.



400 and something dollars?

don't you think 400 and something dollars is expensive?
well, that one cost 400 and something.
your father told me
you go
take 400 dollars and bring them to me.
thirty.

we gave them to
no, no, no, no.
from the bank from which I have


so he gave them to Dan, who was the maintenance boss there.

and Dan went to Keiman, because he told him
there is a special offer at Keiman.
and I want this television.
and he gave it to him, in a piece of newspaper.
and Dan brought the television.
he opened the box.
he installed the television.
and for all that, he was given something, for that.
he was really helpful, that Dan.
oh yes, he certainly was.

he was a good person.
the day he went home and saw that Tito had oxygen, the oxygen machine, he told me
oh, I didn't know
Mrs Ava, I didn't know that Tito was in this condition.
I told him
it's been a while since he needed oxygen all the time.
and he said
I, I'll be coming soon.
because he had gone to look for, to see the air conditioning, because your father was complaining about the heat.

and then he brought me a
a new air conditioning
and he said
look, I've brought a new one, so that you don't have problems.
so, we've had that air conditioning for five years.
the air-conditioning in my room has had more than five years of use.
in your room, in your bedroom?
yes.
but the other one, I don't want them to take it away, because they had put it
the other one in the living-room
yes, because Andrés had put in a new one.

and the only reason that he's still with her because she stuck to him
there are two kids


yeah, she stuck to him there
but who knows


that's because she pressured him into it


that's



































and if the incompetent asks, I'm at Beech.












well, it's the same as Derek.





































that I saw an American.
I saw a gringo driving it.
ah, OK.
I know that I've, he told me.




a yellow one like that.
and you say.
it's this one.























no, then he comes in.

he went into the office.










































he started to shout.







yeah, because Matt crashed hers.



















just imagine how it was.
look, how funny that I'm sitting there, right?


and he's in that waiting room because, like, he, Marcos hasn't started, he's waiting for Billy.







































































but what about that.





















when I go back, I was wrong, my computer was working.








when I get over there it's Trevor sitting in the desk.



























so then you know I do like the things he had picked up and stuff.
and I take it.
and I finished that.















even though I, you know.




because she was, she showed me a picture of her daughter.



but a pretty girl.

oh, your daughter is pretty.

thanks.
to me.



and then when Trevor comes, I go.





yes, you wish that was you.

but she was so pretty

and then, that she, you know, again she's telling me about her stepson








she says that he has a neck like this.

thick.
then they did an MRI the other day.

and she says.
and even though it was an open MRI because he's claustrophobic she says that he was


and then she tried calling the guy so they wouldn't call him so that she can get the results.


















then, you know she was saying that it was.

















and, and he gets on very well with her.
so then he was like, he tells Lucy.











then he tells Lucy, you come in with me, so she left her daughter outside.






then today she called to try and get the results.
but they must have done other things because she said that the white blood count was normal again.






so there's an infection the white blood count would be lower this and that.



so then she kept telling the guy.





























so she looked really sad!


I got a husk

so with everything and this, when you ask I could still feel it a little bit.




and today it was chickpeas, chickpea soup.


you know.
yeah, I know, yeah, chickpea soup.


chickpea soup.

and I ordered a latté with no sugar.

then I kept putting off taking aspirins.



and, they had to, they had to









when he was ready now to go to the bathroom.
I took the spray.
and I began to spray it around.


stay over there




I mean, she, the poor thing, she's not a bad person.

you've gotta run in the other direction, as Mia says.





















what has she done now?










she told me.
then I laughed.
































































so that I had to get up and go.




this, did Trevor, did you get the invitation?













then what I had done is gone ahead and printed it out.





























then, so he, I had noticed when I got there in the morning that he had left it there.





then, but when he left today since I went over there afterwards because then he told me Albert had been there to drop off stuff.
























and

and what's her name is Kelly going with us?








and they have to be there, because if not, after



















































and Trevor's gonna be there early?





unless he goes to pick Julia up, maybe.

yeah, so that we don't have to go in two cars.















yes, because if she was listening when Mary came.
and she said.
she told you that Amy was gonna be a volunteer?








what are they talking about?












who?
don't remember, because she is absent-minded, so

then, then Mia said.

































yeah, this isn't to kill time.
it's a foreshow.












but
yes, she's a little







but she was looking around to see what the others were saying.
I think that












































then she's like, when they did the healings she goes.


there was one that from the lady that had two cases.




there was one that, when they said the name and everything.














































but no

















but no.
doesn't Maria-Jose say that happened.



































she's cute.

she has something cute.
no, and she has it now.
yes.
she has it.






her students should take after her because the, that



















yes, yes, it's a, it's the, it's a couple.


remember that we had the ice-creams.






it's a couple.



I hope mom doesn't think they're a couple, you know.

























she has something.



and she has something with animals too.
what?

well, you see.
immediately she wanted to cut, to clip the wings off Joseph.


Pia is the one that's changing.








but.










she's getting to be an old lady now.
or old man.






















yes, but Caroline wants to.





but very soon she wants to.



because immediately.



























































she says that it's New York.
























but when I went in.
and I saw all those photos of that woman.


the photo of the woman.
then they put flowers?





























and I don't know what.















































you're blind.
so what?



















































































































the circle.



















you don't like it?
















































yes grandma, the environment.

yes, yes.
yes, no you don't.





































this is just daft.

but we were talking about the cult.
and how everything, like, it's weird.









oh, sorry.









and it's a freaking garden.


oh my, get out of here, get out of there.















and then one side is a pet shop and the other side is a garden of Joe's.







oh my goodness!
my God!





























are you ill?














































they were up and down together.

















































oh my God, he never shuts up, bro.
















































when you turn 40, what the hell are you going to tell your kids?













and afterwards.









that was when he got rid of it to wash his hair.












there are places in my heart.

that I have wante to hide.

from your light and sanctity.
like treasures deep inside me.




that I cannot.























































this also takes time.











what!






that you can't see them.



















































































like, fuck, what a great pool.

full of oil.













the top of my oven's like, topped, like, stacked










































chicken stock-cubes.

how do you feel?
how do you feel?



police officer.

you wouldn't say police because that's
yeah, officer, yeah officer.


a detective, yes.
officer.



actually you don't want to tell someone you know in fascist Argentina.


officer.
officer.

you don't call your best friend officer.


















































































































throwing stones.
































































































































































































waste-bin.
waste-bin, so it's the same thing.







waste-bin.
it's waste-bin.
waste-bin.




it's just "of the".

just "of the".
slam them together, "of the".


some of the time cause when you take accents and stuff into play those accents can be pretty





there's always "of".
yeah, "professor of French".
if you say "French professor".








































































tell me.









































































and I remember this long-lost, like, Spanish term, you know, which was "to check out ".
to check you out?.

to check out someone
I've never heard of checking you out
to check out someone.
to check out someone.
yeah, to check out someone.


because the thing about "to check out" is that it means to take in visually.









but, so the whole idea was that but, like, "check out", it has this extra component built into the word, of processing








yeah so "check" is like, I am checking her out





to check someone out?
to check someone out, yeah.

I'm checking her out?
or, I like checking you out.
I like checking you out.




yes, or, I'm checking, he's checking out that girl like that.









I'm sizing you up.












I'm checking her out.











there.




















you know, like, we have to check out, like.
we have to check out





isn't it funny how that word mixes "enjoy" and "examine"?
enjoy and what?
enjoy examine?
examine, yeah.




































































I'm going bald!
fuck!
dammit, it's happening.



I mean, there's like, in Spanish, there's "receding hairline", which is just, like, you know, like, it's these areas here.
to get in.










yeah, yeah, the receding hairline.















I wonder where the word "bald" comes from.
bald, I don't know.
















































































































































oh, yeah, yeah.















oh.





















any spoons?
no, there weren't any.
but there were a lot the other day.
where are them?
we don't have already.

but there were a lot.
no, that they do throw it away.
because sometimes you find all the spoons there placed.

I reached the conclusion that they are husband type.
oh, I have to talk with my husband.
he takes off the clothes to go there, to aikido.
he leaves it here at the flat eight hours.
and the shirt.
and the the thing to wash the clothes is less than fifteen inches near to it.
no my hamper doesn't even have a lid.
it's a big, big.

basket that the lid broke long years ago.
he takes the clothes off.
and leave it.
I swear.
he's not even two feet far from the hamper.
and he leaves it at the floor.
five inches here is the pullover.
it's like gentleman.

then he took it off.
I had to talk with him.

I say, you are like other child.
because my son takes a bath.
and leave it.
but leaves everything.
and I have to pick it up.
I have to teach.
have to teach him to pick it up.
when this summer that he is turning, this summer when the nanny will be gone, he is going to begin to do his own laundry.

because he has to begin to do his own laundry, because bloody hell.




and the insolent of my husband is going to say.
look, you're gonna study.
they are very bad-mannered.
because we've had a nanny for three years, they didn't do very much before.
and now they do even less.
he cooks.
that's true.
but you know.
like him.
it's the same as you.


in fifteen minutes has two bowls of cereals.

the other day he tolds me.





and I told him.
eating two bowls of cereal every night those six pounds you just lost.













and he ate the two bowls of cereal.
and I told him.


what's its name?
cheese.
look, why do you have a cup similar to the other girl?
oh, and what do you say about her?










and what is she doing here?
you came to tell me something.
the fifteenth
no, the fifteenth is the mummy day college.

and he analyses your blood-group, and other characteristics.

yes, I have to.
and according to your weight, your blood-group, your personality and other things.
it's that I haven't done this, I haven't done this.






it's because I haven't had a prescription.













I put it on my womb, on my lower abdomen, here and behind.

and then I get so agitated.
and. like, crispy, and.





I.






every month.

twenty-eight days, twenty-eight days.



and that, and that gets stretched.

and that gets stretched.
it doesn't stretch, no.
I'm not happy with that.






yeah, yeah, I used to think, look.
yes, if I get married and I ask my wife please not to have a natural birth because that's a lot of pain and a lot of blood.
no.
no, no, no, but that's better, because a caesarian.

no, a caesarian is worse, a caesarian is worse.


fuck, fuck, you're thinking about, I don't want my wife to have stretched her tight pussy.




but it's, no, it's worse, James, because.
just imagine.
the person recovers more quickly with a natural birth.
no.
exactly, yes.
she gets her shape back more quickly.
yes.
it's better in many ways.
yes.
but it destroys her down there.
but for.









no, I didn't know, I didn't know.

in Spanish, "blood phobia".
yes, so that's when you don't like to see blood.

me neither.

me neither.

no, damn, you're like my dad.






yeah.


yes, yes, yes, kryptonite.

no, my dad is the same.
my dad, he had, he had to stand up to be at my birth.














be quiet.













yeah, he was, no, he stabbed you.

and you almost got killed.

yeah.



that you were.
he couldn't find the vein and he was pricking you.








it worries you.


that's what I was telling you.
yes, yes, yes.
that the mind ought not to focus on problems because it views them as larger.
yes.
so, well, so, look, I'm telling you.
yeah.
and the guy put the needle into me.
and went away.
and I was left there.
so, trying to think about something else, something else, something else.
and I wasn't able.
so when I looked at my arm, I just, I don't know, I began to think, blood, I'm, I'm, blood, blood.
you suffered.

and I felt awful.

yes.
I felt terrible.

yes.
I thought that only happened to women.
no, that's what gives you the sweating.
so that a, a man can have hot flushes?
yes, certainly it gives you the sweats.
you're sweating.
you, you feel weak, you know.
you, like a sudden temperature increase, like.


so that was negligence.






























but it's that I was.





but it's because I don't like pain.

I don't like pain.
no.



but no, the guy.

the guy that we visit, we're going to visit him afterwards, and I'll introduce him to you.
I was like that.
and I vomited.
they did that to me.
but I was so sick because of the situation that I vomited.
and he was like.
oh.
but have you ever totally fainted in your life?
just tell me yes or no.
no, no.
well, you don't know what, you don't know what it feels like to faint.
no.
I almost fainted.

I almost fainted.





















yeah.








what did I tell you?

you have to learn to open your eyes.
and to open your little ears.

because wisdom enters through the eyes and little ears.
sometimes you haven't been listening at all to what I'm saying.
let me finish.

you, you tell me that I talk a lot.
I am going to finish what I was saying.














but what was it that I was telling you?
well, I see blood and I faint.
yeah.





















yeah.











I was, well, I was brave because I was the photographer when my sister was in labour.
I was the photographer.
your sister.
have you got an older sister?
no.
from Carla.

I was there.
when your sister was born.
yes, when she was born.
I thought that you had a sister who had a baby.
no, no, when my, when my was born.
ouch, horrible, horrible
yes, no no.
I felt awkward.
yes.
I felt a bit awkward.
didn't you feel, didn't you feel bad by looking at your mother?
no, the only thing is that I was feeling pain
it gives you hernias and haemorrhoids.
yes, it's like that.


then do not have children.




the sperm and the ovum.

in Spanish you say zygote.
eh, the morula, blastula.

yeah.





















I know, this is a laboratory baby.


this is as if it were a product.
that's not, that's not a person.

no but this is, no no no this is.



a baby, a baby is not a dog you know.
this is, this is, this is so against God and nature that the church is opposed to all of this.
it's so, it's so against life.

what is, I don't know very well what the stem cell thing is that Bush doesn't support.


















I haven't a clue what that is.



and what's that?





because I like sweets.

























ah you, alone.
no no no no.


ah no, I didn't try it.

yes.





yes, that's it.
yes, that's it.
I know all that.
but it is very expensive.
it's very expensive.
yes, yes, yes.
it's very expensive.
they are sweet little leaves.
that you pick.
and dry.
and you put them in your mouth and they make things taste sweet to you.

they sweeten naturally and in a delicious way.
and without calories.
that is this itself.

stevia leaf, that is, this is.
but it is really expensive.
yes, that's why these teas are really expensive.
these teas are organic.
and they are made like in the Hindu tradition, Ayur, Ayur, Ayur, Ayur.












you might not know about some of them like spiritualism.
of course I know about that.


no no no I know, like New Age.

no no no, I know, the New Age, when, so you know.











so in that group I happened to learn about the real spiritualism.




that's New Age.
that is what they call spiritualism in Spanish, or spiritual science.
yes, I know.
I know.
I was in three of those.
three different.
which ones, which ones?
three different groups.
but tell me the name of the groups.
one was called Cima.
another was called Asonde.


and the other one changed it's name later.
but there were those three basically.

and I also was at Círculo Efe.
yeah.


the UFOs.

I was in the woodland, in the mountains looking for aliens.







and I went to these ceremonies.

in the morning.
the, the.



what I liked about Coconut Grove is that that's where the Hari Krishna temple is.
and before they were like tan tan tan.
singing that, that, that, do they sing?
the procession.
they sometimes sing to collect money.

and to collect donations, it's called prasha.

and it is to get free food.
and give food to the rest.

so that people who are hungry eat and learn the Bhagavad Gita.

yes.







it's like a missionary group?
it's a missionary group.


oh no.
that's not Christian.


hey, this is, it's not.

no, this is not.
because at least Christians gave, the missionaries


no no no, because that isn't supposed to be like that.
because at least.
what my understanding is of Catholic missions.
in, eh, they gave them food.
it didn't matter and after that if they wanted to learn about Christianity, they taught them.
but it was not of.







we have come a long way, at least.


Hare Krishna, yes.


what's the meaning of that?
it's a way of blessing Lord Krishna.

and thanking him for existence.
but it's nice.
that is supposed to relax you.

it was interesting.
they usually meditate.
yeah, yes, yes.
meditate.
and eat healthy.
they are good healthy people.
the monks did that.


yes.
they did vespers each
yes.
I was in another group that they called Madame Blavatsky HPB.

it was like metaphysics.
I was in another one that they called El Subuth.
that was a little bit weird.
and I was only thre for a short time because I would visit a lot and I didn't like them and I would go away.

let me see, I was in another that was called
eh, Rosicrucianism.

how do you say it in English?
I don't know.
I don't remember how is it called.
and in what other was I?

I was in El Camino.
I was in.
I was also in this one.
it was like twenty years ago.
it was like ten.
I was very young.

in the, what is it called?
the one of this little black guy that has a full head of big hair and does magic.
damn.
what is it called?


Saibaba is well known in India.
in India there are more than a thousand recognized religions.
yes, yes.





a rebel wihout a cause.














Protestant.
yeah, Protestant.


a little kiss.
no no no, a little kiss.
no a little, no, a little, no.
oh!
ok, a little kiss in the
so you came back.
you came back to the family.
at least look for, at least we understand that, whatever, as Catholics we understand that this is a process.
because, and we have to help each other
eh, to the, to the goal, which is sanctity.
because God, Jesus told us that we all can be saints.

and that's why I was loved by him.
to preach to the ravers.



no I have no idea of what that is.
it's young people who like electronic music.

yes.
electronic music?
yes, techno.
I don't like that.
this.
well, it doesn't matter that you don't like it.
but me, I like it.
and like, really.

I love it.

yes, yes, yes.
yes.
but me, I liked it.
I tried ecstasies when I was twenty one.
but me, I loved that music already when I was young.

at.

at sixteen.
at sixteen, seventeen I used to listen to that music.



well.


oh!

you don't, you don't.
well, it's like I have my issues.
I don't recommend it to you.
I tried something similar, it was LSA.
it was, it was seeds.
they were called Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.
I made a tea.
it was supposed to be with five seeds.

yes.


no this is, this is, this is LSA.
instead of D it's LSA.


yes, yes, it's similar.
no, no, no, shut up.
no.
I've read all of this.






no no no, it's a seed, it's called Hawaii.

what happens, what happened was.
well, it's that I want you to learn from my experience.
what happened was that.





like without, I don't know, interest or intensity.














or Lucky Strike.




but it's that.



so what I'm telling you is that when I smoked marijuana.
I felt some things that I never felt in any other way.
yes.










and I don't regret having smoked marijuana.









this is, this is the Holy Spirit.

no, that's the Holy Spirit.
no I have never felt anything close to the Holy Spirit, never.
no, because you don't, you don't.



yes but.


look, you need catechism.












yes, but imagine if you had faith.
you are such a good person you have to ask God.
give me faith God.
I want to believe in you.
I think that yes, it's true.
if I had faith I would be a better person, maybe happier, but well.
one
well, what I was telling you was this.

I know that I don't smoke anything and I don't do anything anymore.
but some of these days I'd like to try something just once.











no well it's, it's that.

you already know that I had such a bad experience.
I am taking care of you at least.
I'm taking care of you because I don't.
I know, but for me it's clear that it's just once and this is it.
yes.
but the.
it's what a lot of people say right but

but I might never do it.

let me speak.
what happened the first time I did it, I did the five, it's only five.
you make a tea with five, five seeds.
five what?
five seeds.


those seeds, the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.

and he told me.




then, at the airport, the guy that checked our luggage.
the guy knows too much, my friend.
the flight was delayed two hours.
and I was talking to him for the two hours.
and the guy also, you know, like, we started to talk.
on the return flight?
yes.
we started to talk.
and the guy tells me.
I tell him.
you know, I plan to move in August.

you know, maybe there at JetBlue they'll give me a job.
and he tells me, well, you know, obviously with me.
he gave the telephone number and everything.
he tells me.
with me, you know,, try to see what I can do.
besides, you get free tickets.

he, I was boarding.
I give him the boarding ticket.
then he tells me.

and I'll give you my phone number, a guy from the Dominican Republic.
and I.
well, okay.
good.
was he good-looking?
no.

not at all
then I arrive.
and I am waiting like that with Maria.
and he gives me, he gives me, you know, his name, last name, email and telephone number.
it was almost as if he was my buddy.

so he gave me that and suchlike.
and he tells me.


you know, basically I only pay taxes.
I don't pay for the ticket.
ah.
Henry wanted to do that to go to Canada.
uh-huh
then he told me that.
that
no, he.
overly friendly, he tells me.
and can't he get us something?
I'll talk to him.
to see if we can go on a weekend.
yes.
but when I'm living over there, you will have a place to stay.
I have a place to stay.
my cousin lives over there, the one that got married.


he got married the twenty fourth of, Thanksgiving, the same as Carla.

yes?

yeah, so, but he lives in New York.
so, he said
you can come whenever you want, you know, well.
great.
but the same way when you move there, I'll be there every weekend.
and if you're working with JetBlue, boarding passes every weekend.
obviously.
no, what I truly want, my friend, is find a job that,.
and then he also tells me.
no, look, the best way to make a living as a student is to be a bartender.
by the way, I do not want to study at night.
I want to study in the morning, because you know, young people are, I want.
you know because even though.
of course.
I don't want to be the only one in class studying at, at night.
so, you know an office job doesn't suit me.


so what I want is, you know, bartending would be, I don't know, to see, to see how I'd do it, but.
I think that bartending is.
but did you already apply at Pace?
did you send the essay or not?
no, I haven't sent it.

ah, so, there is NYU, it has, and.
but, for example Pace Mari? Road Manhattan, that is another I saw.
there are a few, you know.
it's more, I think all but NYU have rolling admission.

so that you can apply until classes start.
obviously it is on a first come, first served basis.
you know,, that is why I have to apply now so it arrives on time.
but nothing, you know, I am going to go anywhere.
and then in January, God willing, I'll start at NYU.
shit, that's so cool.
it was great.

it was great
it was cold, right?
oh my God, you know I was freezing.

even though I had twenty jackets and twenty scarfs.
oh, really?
yes.
and I imagined you with the orange jacket walking down.
with your high heels, waiting for the taxi.

and I got into a taxi.
but, you don't pay, you didn't take the picture.
man, I took 10 pictures.
it was a day that Maria, Maria's friend, the friend's boyfriend, and I went.
we went on a trip I wanted to go on.
ah, the girlfriend has a boyfriend?
yes, bad.
I mean, they are never apart, they study together.
after class they are together the whole day.

and Maria with all this.
she had a breakdown because she got drunk.










so we went out.
we're talking.
and she starts crying.
no, that I came to visit Ana.
and she loves the boyfriend more than me.
obviously she was drunk.
she tells me.
she loves the boyfriend more than me.

then, you know, she was feeling bad.
and she started to say, and I, and I.


she tells me.
when I talk to dad and mom on the telephone they tell me.
I love you a lot.
and I say.
okay, bye.
and I said.
it's all right, but it's okay, you know, they know you love them.
it's okay if you can't say it.
it's okay, you know?
like, you should say, shouldn't you.
but, okay, it was like that, Maria was feeling bad.
bad, this.
and now, she doesn't want to move, or does she?
yes.
yes, when, when we got to the airport obviously, crying.
we arrived.
in the airplane we were fine.
you know, she was happy.
but the friend did not pay her too much attention.
I mean.
I mean, anyone.

worst, because I mean, Maria didn't go to New York with me, because she too was interested in the universities also.
and she didn't go to New York, so she could stay and be with her friend.
and I was arriving from New York at ten o'clock at night.
and Maria was watching television downstairs alone.
and I asked.

of course Ana is with her boyfriend in the bedroom or downstairs or whatever, you know?
like, she's with him.
and I say.
what a fool, and she is not with you.
and she tells me.

I say.
well you came all the way to Miami to see him, I mean, to see her.
you know, I mean, so when, when, when she was drunk and she started to say all this, suddenly Ana, you know, all the friends came to the park.
that,
and Maria went off with Ana and she started to tell her.
like, no, that you love him more than you love me.
you know?
but then I went to them.
you guys never told me this stuff.
it is too much trouble,.
but it is not that you love him more than you love me.

but no, but it's that Maria is very, very sensitive and she keeps it all inside.

so

until she got drunk.
and it was that that, that I realized and I said, well, I mean.
is this the first time she got drunk?

her first time drunk?
no.
no, but it was the first time I was present.
you know, the first time she confided in me.
damn.
and Maria feels bad, bad.
I told her.
poor thing.
Maria you should go to a psychologist.
when I was there I told her.
Maria you should see a psychologist.
and she tells me.
why?
and I.
Maria, because, you know, you're feeling bad.
and she tells me.
no, psychologists are only for crazy people.
and I say.
Maria, let's go together.

and she tells me.
anyway,. I can't go to a person who's, that I don't know.
and confide in that person.
and I say.


because, like, with me she let it all out so well.
she's, human.
no, I know.

but.
look, I didn't tell you.

but they gave Cecilia her visa.
really, she's coming?
yes, she's coming in August.
and then, honey, she's more beautiful and
she told my mother.

you're joking.
and she says.
that was killing me, I mean.
she told my mother, she told Carlota.
I almost died if I cannot go to Laurie's graduation.
because you know she has been there for me through everything.
oh, so sweet.
in my high school graduation, in my graduation, everything, man.
I am going to cry.
she is so beautiful.
she's lovely.
no, man, I mean.
and in August, when?
oh, I am not going to be here.
no, but I am taking her to New York.

but she's only coming for a week.
but, I mean, man, she is something, so, so lovely, you know?
yes.
but her mother does not help her with anything.
why?
I mean, the mother did not go with her to the embassy interview.
why?
because her mother is like that.
the mother is too much.
I mean, when she bought the automatic car, the mother says.
you're not going to know how to drive that.
and she says.
Laurie is teaching me.
and she says.
and the mother say.

and then I say.
Cecilia, it's because she herself doesn't know how.
and she envies you.
because you are doing everything that she can never do.
exactly.

you understand, then she sees that you're getting on well with Luis; the boyfriend.
yes.
and she.
I mean, the mother said.
if Luis goes on that trip, you're not going to go.
and furthermore, you're not going to go at all.
I'm not going to give you money.
and she says.
well, I'll pay myself.
oh but the mother said.
you are not going to go in August.
and Cecilia said.
she told my mother.
she told me all this, because I have not talked with Ceci.
she wrote to me on Facebook.

and she said.
they gave me the visa, whatever.
and so, you know, she told my mother.
you are like a second mother to me.
and she said.
because you support me in everything, you know.
Carlota, you are always there.
my mother told her.
I want to take you on a cruise with us, Laurie.
I mean, you come.
and I'll pay.
yes, man, she is really lovely.
oh, precious.
listen, with which, with which airline, did you buy your ticket to go to Venezuela just now?
with American.
well, what happened is that we got it cheaper because of the dollars thing.
exactly because.
Venezuelan bolivars.

I mean, it was two million bolivars, wasn't it?
therefore at the official exchange it would be one thousand dollars.
but at the black market exchange rate, three hundred and eighty.
that's it exactly.
but my mother.
I give her three hundred and eighty dollars.
and she changes them on the black market.
exactly.
but all the same, it went down.
yes?
when we went to Venezuela they were, I mean, they were five thousand.
no, no way, it was four thousand.
and my mother would sell them.
I mean, she would buy Peter's dollars at five thousand.
she was giving away money.
yes, and at the moment it's three thousand on the black market.
it means that it is really going down like that.
what, why?
my mother says.
I don't have money to send you anymore, because I am losing money.
exactly.
my mother says.
I was going to do a television commercial.
and she had to change forty thousand dollars.
and she said.

because of the exchange rate.
man, that's bad!
too much.
my mother said.
I'm ruined; I don't have any money for you,.
and I said.
okay mother, thank you very much.
no, because I have to, I have to go to Venezuela in June.
but.
in June.
the seventeen, eighteen and nineteen.
but the tickets cost six hundred.
yes, honey.
then it is too expensive.
and you know obviously, no.
it is expensive, right now I would tell you okay, you pay my mother.
I mean, you deposit the dollars or whatever.
if she buys it and the exchange rate,.
but since the dollar is very low right now.
no, even if I want, even if I want, because I have to pay, it's with a credit card.

so no, I couldn't do it either.
unless you go to the casino.
and you win three hundred dollars.
they charge, percent.
and you pay her in cash.
aha, I know.
you have to.
no, but.
no, but, I mean, I have a notion of going to Venezuela.
I'm there for a week for my cousin's confirmation.
I return, almost directly to New York.
but are you going for sure in July?
and how are you going to look for an apartment?
I don't know if in July or in August.
as soon as you arrive there?
I mean, would you stay in Maria's friend house?
I don't think so, because my parents are going.
ah, they're going with you?
yes, I asked my mother and I said.
mommy, you are going to,.
you know, are you going to send me there on a plane.
and look after yourself.
take care there.
or are you going to leave me.
and.
we're going with you.
and she tells me.
no, obviously, you know, we're going with you.
that's nice.
what was I telling you?
that your parents are going to go with you.
aha, so, you know, my mother tells me.
no, you know, we're going with you.
we'll be there with you until you find an apartment.
and you're sorted.
and settled.
and then, you know, we'll come back.
but obviously we are not going to throw you out and that's it.
and I.
thank you.
and I say.

but, no, I will visit you before the summer ends.
man, because I am not going to graduate in August.
in December?

and look, look at the stupidity, okay?
I mean, I'm missing Stats Two, Research Methods, and Psychological, Social Psychology Lab and Social Psychology, and I don't know what.
I'm missing those four classes.
therefore, Stats Two, I have to take it in order to enrol for Research Methods.
Research Methods I have to take it to enrol for the other class.


I have to do that in the summer.
that.

in the summer and in August, the fall I have to do one class.

stupid, man.
oh no.
but I'm still going to apply to.
I feel like killing you.

so, well.


but, well, I don't know.
because, you know, I got rejected for May.
Carla.


Carla too?


but she says we're lower division, but.
man, I have so many credits.
why?
I don't know.


the point is that
well, I don't know.
what were you going to tell me?.
let me see, the guy from Jet Blue.
look, we went to Time Square.
to Maria's friend's mother's office.
it's in Time Square.
and she was the one that took us to the airport.
and Maria tried to print the, the tickets, the boarding passes.
and the computer, I don't know, it didn't let us.
we called customer service.
and they couldn't give us one either.


okay, we arrived.
and the guy that took care of us, was the twenty-six year old guy from Dominican Republic.
and so the guy, he is like this.
he takes care of the issue.
so he told us.
well, okay, B5, whatever.
we went in.
I went in.
I ate a wrap.
and the flight was delayed two hours.
and I said.
okay.
I got up.
and I asked a guy that was working there.
look, isn't there a smoking room here?
no, there's none.
and I.
you're joking.

and then, but, but he tells me.

did you leave from Fort Lauderdale?
yes.
ah, okay.
so, no, but this was coming back.
I mean, in New, in La Guardia airport.
ah, okay.
there in Queens.
and then I go and see the guy who, who got us the boarding passes, the one that's twenty six years old.
I go there and I tell him.
look, there isn't a smoking room around here by any chance, because another guy told me there wasn't one.
and he tells me.
no, there isn't one.
but if you wait, if you give me two minutes, I'll take you, I'll take you outside.

and I say.
okay
okay, the two hours I had to wait.

smoking with the guy and Maria.
we talked two hours.
I mean, the guy really he knows my whole lifestory.
I know everything about his life.
it was great.
and you know, obviously, he liked me.
so the guy says, the guy says.
that when I return and that, you know.
I give you my telephone number.
and you call me for whatever you need.


okay.
so.
well, you have a friend
I know.
then Maria.
he left for a moment, because he had something to do.
and Maria tells me.



exactly, because surely it was because you had to meet him.
and I say.
he's really nice.
but, what, the guy is really good-looking, you know?
he told mehe told me and everything.
he tells me.
before you come back, call me.
to see if I can get you a ticket, you know, cheaper or even free.
and I say.
okay, thank you.
oh, but he was really nice.
yes.
man, I'm dying to go to New York.
I really wanted to take Peter.
you know, with the money I had left over.
for the weekend that I did not work last week.
last week end?
and they were.
it was two hundred and sixty both tickets.
they were ultra-cheap.

it's that is cheaper.
yes, it's that, it's like.
it was like thirty nine one way and thirty nine back, something like that.
exactly.

plus the taxes, which is what raised the price.
plus the taxes, of course.
but, it's super cheap.
but, I said.
where are we going to stay?
I couldn't tell my cousin.
yes, like, look I'm going tomorrow.
can I stay in your house?
besides, he's actually married.
I would have had to tell him in advance, you know, like.
yes, exactly.

no, I arrived Wednesday.
Wednesday, you know, we stayed in, in New Jersey, where we were staying in Maria's friend's house.
we went out, you know, we were all day with her friend and that.
the following day, I did not go to New York either.
I don't remember why.
but I didn't go.
I went with Maria to New York.
but then that day, I arrived.
and Maria, you know, we were like that all day.
and I met Alberto, my friend.
then we left Maria at the girl's office.
they went back home.
and I stayed with him in Time Square, walking.
that day I had high heels.
Maria made me walk forty blocks.
the bus left us from New Jersey.
it left us in 178th St in Broadway.
okay and the streets,.
my lovely little sister.
no, I swear I'm in a much better position than Alberto.
because he lives in Queens in Manhattan.
but you have good memory for those things.
and I am, I mean.
then she arrives.
and the girl frightens me.
the mobile that I bought.
aha.
she was afraid to take the metro, the subway because she didn't know.
you know, she didn't know what train to take and that.
and I tell her.
Valeria.
you know, she made me walk from 178th St to 130th St.
in high heels.
oh no, and she was obviously in tennis shoes.
and I say.


and I say okay.
until a moment arrived and I told her.
that's it, no more.

we went down, that's when the guy told us.
just take that one and mumble, you know, and.


and I say.
okay.
scared,, paranoid, obviously.
I was really paranoid, like, okay, you know.
they'd told me that this was a bad place, you know.
of course.
be careful.
and besides, when he dropped us at 178th St.
we were walking.
and Maria calls her friend's mother and tells her.
look we are at 178th St.
get out of there.
that's a bad neighborhood where I don't know what, and this and that.
and I say.

that it is a bad neighborhood and stuff.
I called Alberto.
and he does not answer.
and I left him a message.
Alberto, call me.
rescue me, we are in a bad neighborhood.
help me.
I don't know how to get there, how to get out of here, and stuff.
Alberto tells me.
no, you know, it is not a bad neighborhood.
but rather there are a lot, a lot of people who, everybody is going to flirt with you.
you know, everybody is going to say things to you.
but don't pay them any attention, just keep on walking.
and I, well, okay, so I tell Maria.
Maria, walk quickly.
and as if you know where we are going.
I mean, don't look as if you're lost.
and she's.
well, okay.
so both of us walked forty blocks until finally we went on the subway.
and well, there we were, yes, we arrived to Time Square, terrific.
and nothing was happening, so they left.
and Alberto.
you know, and he went.
went to Pace University.
that day we only went to Pace.
but we walked all round Times Square.
you know, that day we walked.
didn't you go to the Empire State Building later?
no.
what it was, was a trip to look at universities.
that means I didn't go to the Empire State.
I didn't go.
I didn't go anywhere.
the Statue of Liberty, no?
nowhere.
girl.
but the thing is.

exactly.
instead of the tourist places.
but the thing is, the thing is that I wasn't there.
you know, I wasn't there to, to do that.
of course not.
but to go to the universities and that's it.
but, I mean, your choice is NYU.
in January.
but.
so what is your second choice?

my second choice, I mean, no, I'm going to apply to all of them.
I can't apply to NYU at the minute.
so in August I apply to start in January.
and right now, you know, I'm going to apply to all the ones I saw.
I saw like eight universities.
and you are going to continue with Psychology or not?
yes.
yes, but no.
I mean, yes, for the time being.
but if from here on I decide another career, I'm going to change it.
because, you know, what I like are fashion, design, acting and all that.
so we are at the girl's office which is on the sixth floor.
and in the, in the building opposite.
you know, it is all glass, so in the building opposite there were also other girls in, in the, in another, in another office.
they were all were dark, except in that one.
and there were five women.
then one takes off her shirt.
and puts on another one, and I don't know what stuff.
and the people, you know.
like, it was a design thing.
where they designed shirts.

how do you say it?
I don't know.
I don't know, I mean that, that they were hemming the shirt.
you know, like, fitting it.
and it was, you know, like, like a design company.
OK.
so I'm looking at that.
and I said.
shit, imagine how nice it would be to study design in New York.
and be in an office like that, designing clothes.
and I said.
you know?
it really grabbed my attention.
and then, you know, I started to think.
and I said.
shit, what if I change from psychology and whatever in NYU?
man, I swear, I was about to.
you know, I said.
I am going to change and study Business.
only because, look, in NYU they have a program.
I don't know what you do to enter that program.
when you study Business there is a program where you have the option of studying maybe the four years of the course.
the first year in New York, the second one in Paris, the fourth in London and the fifth one in Shanghai.
shit.
I mean, I saw that.
and I said.
I'm not going to study Psychology; I am going to study Business.
but NYU is very expensive, isn't it?
yes.
it is fifty thousand a year, including the dorms.

shit
but the dorms are.
do you know Manhattan, more or less?
you know Time Square is on 42nd St and.
and I mean, Seventh and Eighth St are near there.
the new dorms at NYU for upper classmen, which is what I would be, are on 23rd St and Third Avenue.
I mean, it's, I went to a college that is there.
and we walked to Time Square; you know, it's twenty blocks.
and really for me the blocks are twenty paces.
do you walk quicker or not?
yes, and the worst is that, yes.
so, you know, so the guy tells us.

granite counter-tops.
washing machine and dryer inside the apartment.
shit, nice.
you know that's what I said.
in that dorm, yes, I'd stay.
you know, I mean, in the other dorms, I saw them
and they are horrible, horrible.
but did you do tours in the universities?
yes, yes to all of them.
ah OK.
the only one where I didn't do a tour of the university was NYU.
because I went.
I mean, it was an hour of, of, an hour and a half of an information session.
and the other one, it was about, about, about the college.
but, you know, after the information session, I liked it so much, that I said.
the truth is, I don't care.
and besides, Maria was really tired.
so, you know, she wanted to go back.
so we didn't do that tour.
but we did.
you know, the information session.
I swear, only that the professors are the best.
everything is, like, truly excellent.
it was the one that grabbed my attention the most.
so it's fifty thousand a year with the dorms.
and thirty-five, between thirty and thirty-five.
I don't remember, without the dorms, I mean, the tuition only.
but, you know, I am applying to the.
so they can give me something.
of course.
and I am going to apply for scholarships.
and all that stuff, you know, obviously all the help I can get.
of course.
help.
but the rest, you know, no.
oh, I don't know, I am really excited.
I want to leave already, you know.
oh, yes well, we, Bruce and I, we have to.
right now, because of the classes and all that.




and do a class in UCL, it is the last one I'm missing.
to see if they accept my credit.
well.
because Olga did that.

because Olga graduated in UT.
and she left for DC.
and she was short of one class.

and they gave it to UT so that they could give her the diploma.
yes?
but she went.
so.
she applied as a transfer.
I don't know, I have to ask her.
because.
in the universities that I saw, I mean, the transfer students, they accept, like, sixty-eight credits.
they don't accept them for you.
you know, if I have ninety credits and want to transfer, they only accept sixty-eight.
I see.
it would be a credit that FIU has to accept for me.
will it be?

no, I don't know if it can be done, but you'll have to find out.
but that would be for, for when?
yes, I have to.
for August.
I mean, to move in August to Orlando.
to move in August to Orlando.
ah, because I told you about the work, no?
the one that the girl told me about.

but I would like to offer you a display room for yourself.

and I said.

no, but I don't know.


what, for real?
but she told me.

and I tell her.

because Bruce said.
well if we go.
because, we're planning to go with all the family.

you're kidding.


there are twelve persons.

I mean, my mother, her boyfriend.
because at the moment, my mother is not going to get married, because his twenty-five year old daughter has a cat.
then my mother told him.
because she was going to move to his house when they get married.

and him and her would be living there with the cat.
but your mother's apartment, I mean, she is not going to sell it yet.
no, it is for us.
exactly.
so listen.
so my mother told him.
well, how about.
and she told him that.

OK.
exactly.
my mother hates cats, animals of any kind.
my mother said.
besides that, she said.
the cat throws up every two minutes on the sofa.
disgusting.
and my mother has to remodel the whole apartment, because that problem of the wife, the ex-wife.
aha.
so then she said.

you know, it sheds thousands of hairs as well.
no, no, no.
my mother said.
no, no.
the cats are treacherous.
so.
yes, then my mother said.
well, you know what, I'm just get a new,, like, you have to get rid of the cat or I'm not going to move in.
exactly.
so he said.
well, so he told Mariela, his twenty-five year old daughter.
he told her.
look Mariela, we are going to have to get rid of.
the cat's name is Apollo.
OK.
then he said.
Apollo has to leave.
because besides that he was really stressed out, because that day the cat threw up three times on the sofa.
and so, you know, he told Mariela.

and she started to cry like a one-year old girl.
and she is twenty-five years old?
that it is my cat, that you are not going to take him away, that I don't know what.
so my mother said.
OK, thanks to Apollo I realized that it is going to be a tad difficult to live with her, because my mother says.

the woman of the house, exactly.
you know, my mother said.
but no, because it is her, because it is her house.
then he, she said.
he said.
well, let's move to your apartment.
then my mother said.
OK.
so he said.
well, there are four rooms in my apartment.
and he said.
well, one room will be.
obviously him and my mother when they get married.
and it would be the nanny with Mario.
the little one and a half year old boy.
aha.
and there is one room left for my brother and I.
then he said.
that's not really fair, because if the two of them come at the same time, your kids don't have anywhere to stay.
exactly.
so my mom's like.



okay, let's rent an apartment.

but then my mother said.
it is ridiculous.




so, they're waiting for her to leave home so that they can move in.
and, you know, they live in the apartment, because the little boy lives with his grandmother.
because since he works all day and that.
ah, it's a shame, ah, no.
everywhere they go, he has to take the nanny.
because then the nanny lives there with him, twenty four seven, you see.
exactly.
a problem, a problem.
did I not tell you what happened to me in Venezuela?
wait, wait, before you tell me, do you know that Miguel is getting married?
yes, when he comes back from.
what do you think?
, not that, yes, I agree.
yes?
you are the first one to tell me that you agree.
no, I agree because I feel my cousin has matured with her in some respects.
and I feel that he is not Antonio Perez.
I don't know why, but it gives me more reassurance.
no.
OK, but do you know her situation?
no.
she doesn't have legal papers.
ah.
that is Juana's, Juan's, everybody's fear.
your uncle still doesn't know.
I myself didn't know that.
I think they are not going to get married, because I think that when he tells your uncle.
your uncle is going to tell him.
you are crazy, you are a child.
I mean, think things through properly.
I mean, she is a girl of twenty-seven year with a boy of twenty

and another thing, I mean, I really do like her a lot, I adore her, she's great.
today I called her and crying with me and I said.
oh, you know, be calm, he will be back soon and stuff.
but I do feel that she does love him,.
no, no, yes, the.
that's why.
the, my problem isn't the papers thing.
sincerely, I do think, shit, she'ss twenty seven years old.
I think she is certainly ready to get married.
because she.
no, of course, besides.
you know?
what would she do with a boy of twenty-seven, twenty?
actually, if she really didn't love him, why the fuck?

but Antonio has matured, but it does not mean he is mature.
Mari is too immature, really too immature.
I am going to take one.
I mean, it does not mean that he is, that he has matured.
I mean, he has matured a little bit, but he is not mature like that.
yes.
but.
no, no, no.
I mean, I follow it like.
the only thing I would say doesn't seem right to me in their relationship is that Antonio is too happy, too calm, you know, I mean, too happy at the moment now that finally everything is turning out well for him.
you know, what he likes is to go out and fool around; and, you know, and have a good time.
and she is ultra-sulky.
I mean, everything has to be her way, and if not she gets sulky.
for example, the day I arrived, Monday.
well, I arrived at two in the morning.
we went to Juan's house.
we were there.
and later we went to express, Carmen, Miguel and I.
and Carmen was really sleepy.
so she went to sleep in the car.
and Miguel and I, we were eating.
he was eating a hamburger and I was eating two meat pies.
and we were eating this way, very normal.
and Carmen comes in.
she screamed.
open the door.
Miguel, I'm leaving because I don't know what, that you are in the house.
and I said.
OK.
and I said.
give us a minute.
you know, Miguel had only this much of the hamburger left.
I tell her.
wait until he finishes the hamburger.
and, you know, calm down.
but, you know, things like that.
and it's not the first time either.
she's, like, very sulky.
she is Sofia part two?
no.

honey.
so you know, that it does not seem right because.
I don't know, I mean, I know he is happy with her.
but he, I know he has not got over Petra.
and Petra has not got over him either.
I'm not saying either that he should be with Petra, because that relationship is already damaged.
it's not going to, it's never going to be the same.
yes.
that is Otto and Alicia.
exactly, but you know, like, I don't really know, I mean.

I don't know.

and I mean, they've been together for two months.
okay, I take you point.


but listen, at the same time, you know, I don't know, I feel it's very quick.
I don't know why.
and has somebody told him that?
Juan is the only one that told him.
it doesn't seem right.
I don't agree.
I just don't know.
and when he told me.
I, Juan knew.
so him and me were outside alone.
and then he tells me.

and I said.
well.

and I tell him.
OK, the bad news.
I thought it had to do with Mariela, the bad news.
so he tells me.

and I said.

and then he tells me.

when he told me like that.
then he tells me.
before you say anything, don't scold me.
I ask you.

I bit my tongue.
and I said.

I am not going to give him my opinion, nothing, because he doesn't want it.
maybe because they have told him already, then.
exactly, exactly.
he tells me.
I don't want you to be like Juan, because he scolded me.
but I didn't know she didn't have papers.

I'm not saying because she would seem to have an interest or whatever.
of course.
you understand me, because.
no, because, yes, yesterday when we were in the, you know, they went out for a moment and her sister, her, and me stayed.
the girl looked at me.
and she burst into tears.
and I said.
no.
so she started to sob.
and she tells me.
I'm not going to be able.
she tells me.
no, I mean, I'm not going to be able to be without him for that long.
and she tells me.
you know, I have been living with him for three months.
and I love him a lot.
I'm not going to be able to be without him.
but he's going for two months to.
and then he's coming back.
and he comes back the tenth, the fifteenth of June.
and he stays for a while?
Juan told me that they give him two weeks.

we have a friend, Adrian, in the.
that he, he has come back, but not for long.
I mean, all the vacation that they give him, obviously he comes here because he has his family here.
he came when I was in New York.
but the, the last time he came, before that one.
ah, my cousin told me about that.

that he is a, a, a black guy, a pimp.
he told me.
he is from Nicaragua.
I don't know why he told me.
a friend of mine is coming from.
and we're going to go to Laguna.
but today it's like.
and you know he said.
I don't know if you like the music, because it is hip-hop.
and I said.
I'm not going to go because I don't like it.
OK.
and he told me, like.
no, well,.
don't make that mistake.
I went with Miguel one Friday; never again in my life will I go on a Friday to Laguna.
it was because the Saturday, Miguel's birthday, it was hip hop.
why?
and they changed the DJ just recently.
and I said.

I hope that some day this fucking cold will go away.
fuck.
all this cough, yes, this cough.
because she is going away next week so I have to put in more hours.
girl, but who comes up with the idea of making bubblegum with these different flavors?
yes.
yes.
did you take any aspirin or something like that?
and where did you take so many sweets from?
who did you confiscate them from?
who did you confiscate them from?
all these sweets are from your daughter?
but why does she have so many sweets?
fuck then.
but, but Catalina, this is like.
oh, you got so many eggs?
fuck.
fuck.

do you remember it?






















how is the shrimp?

you are so fucking bad, Ramona!
and it's going to go on hurting you.
but didn't you realize that you were getting burnt?
how long were you outside?
and you felt asleep?
babe, the worst hours!

fuck, you seem like a tourist.
you're a tourist.
stupid.
fuck, either you're a tourist or you're stupid.
which beach did you go?
she, you were trying to be a tourist.
she was trying to be a tourist.
that's why I told you, she was trying to be a tourist.
no, oil of
do you remember?
with mercurochrome.
mercurochrome.
my mom has a very famous and colorful story.
when I didn't have, my dad and me.
yes me.
tomato.

my mum since we were kids she was always obsessed with sunscreen.

my dad and me, we are the fairest ones.
I was about a year old.
they were in the Dominican Republic.
she sends my dad.
we went to the beach.
and she forgot the sunscreen, the Coppertone.
she sends my dad to a little shop on the path.
yes, but she says that she speaks, understands Spanish?

aha, oh yes, I'll keep talking in Spanish.
bitch.

Ramón, we forgot the sunscreen.
go in there, or you and María will get very burned.
my dad like blondish-coloured hair, big blue eyes.
he looked like a gringo in the middle of the Dominican Republic, where everybody has a nice tan.
I need, you know, sunscreeen.
they sell my dad a little bottle.
and straightaway she says.
this, what is this, Ramón, this, you know?

I don't know.
you asked me for sunscreen.



it was olive oil with mercurochrome.
oh, I'm sorry, I said baby oil with mercurochrome.



























did you burn your back or not?
but you spent the four hours laying in the water like that, getting burnt like a lizard.
like a lizard.


uhhuh, yes.

fuck, Lorrie, you are worse than tourists from Iowa or Kansas.







fuck, but.

a little hat.
son of a bitch.




yes a
he doesn't put on sunscreen either.
and did you put sunscreen on your daughter?
I'm going to slap you!
I'm going to slap you!



yes, the fact is that we insulted you.


and she, and she's the one who cost us, cost him a million dollar project.
don't you remember?
were you here?
no, you weren't here.
no, she is the one from Sunset Heights who's now on Main Drive.
it's a pain.
you have no idea.
Sunset Heights is delayed all the time that there is because of her, because of her.
one year.
poor Andy, all the projects have given him headaches, all of them, poor guy.

Cati are you going to charge us for using your lotion?



















good morning mister García Pérez.


how was it?

did you go anywhere or not?






is that that is not full?


because I would imagine that in the time after Christmas there would be no space for
well Juana says that last year she went to Disney before Christmas and that it was very nice because there was nobody.

like two or three days before Christmas
and I tell her: Juana, are you crazy?
she tells me.
there wasn't anybody.



so Mr Bowers called me.

you know the neighbor from A One who complains about the light, the dump slide in his backyard or something.







and apparently he sent the principal of AOne one of those insulting horrible whatever emails that they told him, you know, you can't communicate with her anymore.



check the photometrics with the light shield is something you know whatever

well, that's why I've been calling to Pedro so that he tells me which one it is so that you know which is the pole that we put it on because I don't know which one it is

I think that it's the one next to it

and then his other thing he noted that when he was at the UOne siding and connector road that we put lights on

he tells me that those are even closer to the neighbors'.




ok so it'll be the same thing and we may have to put house shi you know home house shields on those in order to at least remove a little bit because he wants to at least show the.
look when he didn't have a shield this one was the one that corresponded to you.

















I was telling him that there are people who
I was telling him that there are people who might think it strange.
what?
to do that
María was telling me that
well, because not everyone likes being recorded while talking.
yes, but I think that, because they don't recognise, because they don't know that
no, no, I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know,.
no, she's not silly or anything but
well, for my part, the truth is I don't really like her either
the day that they asked me to do the advert, the recording for that advert they were going to do about that story of the woman who had the insurance problem.
I didn't want to do it.
I did it because, I did it because my boss told me that I had to do it.
and because I didn't have any other choice.
but.

yes, yes, well no, because I don't have it


because they took it to Spain.
ah, but are they back already?
and
Caro's not back.
they're on vacation.
oh, in Paris.
see you tomorrow, tomorrow
he told me, I told you, didn't I tell you that that girl Mary Smith
Mary Smith a girl that comes.
not a girl, she's an old lady who lives in London.
she's going to move to Paris.
and she used to work for the Exploratorium.
she spent, like, twenty-four years working for the Exploratorium there in California, in San Francisco.
I don't know what happened there.
but she ended up in London, working in London.
but I don't know if there's a science museum there.
and just now she's moving from London to Paris.
she tells me that they have a place.
I don't know if they're renting it to her quite cheap or something.
and that they have a separate bedroom for us.
to arrive,.
yes, next week?
no, whenever you want.
when you see me arrive some Friday with a suitcase in tow.
yes.
then you'll know you're leaving.
but she says to me.
yes, I have a room.
and she doesn't rent it, she doesn't
no,.
yes, sure.
no?
she doesn't, because it's an apartment, right.
no, but maybe she'll find a roomate.
a roomate.
she's a little immature to
yes, a little, how would you say it?
mature.
mature.
no, because she can't find another woman to live there in the same conditions.
I don't know.
no, she doesn't need it.
oh, OK.
she doesn't need it
I think that she's always been single.
I think
I don't know
I think that she's always been single
and what happened in the end with the one in Mexico?
with the,.
ah I told you but you were falling asleep.
she told me.
she sent an email saying that there was, that there was another person managing it in her place.
uhuh, but they were trying to establish the museum as a separate entity, ween't they?
no.
all the museums.
they divide the museums.
there's the Science Musem, the Museum of Light and two more.
it must be a very big complex.
so she is seeing.
she was, she was in Universon's management.
I don't know if that means that they all are.
I think it means they all all are.
she's in Universon because you go to the Universon webpage.
and then there's, there's a place you can click to see the Light one, the Sciences one, the different ones.
the different ones.
so she is seeing if they separate it.
and put all the museums under her.
and what she gave me to understand was that the general management is, like, combined.
that not only the museums are under that management, but others too.
other things.
other things that aren't museums.
that aren't museums.
so she's seeing if they give her the museums.
but then she had charge of everything before.
it seems.
it seems, seems that there was.
and if they give her the museums she'd be reporting to the person who's currently in that position.
I don't know.
or, or, or they give her the other part.
and they leave her alone.
it's really a whole city in there.

it's the Unam.
ah, everything is part of the university.
everything is part of the university.
that's why it's a little strange, the way in which it's organized.
so OK, but then, but she told me that I shouldn't worry, she and Edith would be glad to go there.
she implied, as I read it, that it was her and Edith.



that's in October.
in October you are leaving for what, a week?
in October, no, only some four days, that's all.
four days.



Lilian, well, but in your bedroom, because Lilian is watching the other film.
you know what, Antonio, turn on the heating.
what was I going to tell you
what was I saying?
that I'm hungry.
what would you like to eat?
do you want to get something or?
well, it's that or pasta because
no, I don't want any more pasta.
it's not good to eat pasta at night.
but.
I mean, it's no bad, but.
yes, but I'm not going to start cooking something this late.
I'm not telling you that you have to cook.
that's why I'm telling you either we'll go out and get something or I'll make some pasta because pasta is fast.
maybe banana soup.
no?
and the kids?
banana soup.
what else was I going to say to you?



and what was I saying?
about the woman in the Mexico Museum.
that she told you yes, it was,.
yes,.
it's, like, four days.
but there I don't know if I'm staying with Jessica or
why?
her family, what does it have to do with Jessica?


well, don't take a shower.



but you have to shower first.
you better take a shower.
take a shower.
and you come with me.
do you think he understood what I just said?
yes but he didn't agree with it.

he doesn't want to go in pyjamas?
he doesn't want to have a shower.

shower properly.
Mirna wanted to come because she thought that if she came to do this she'd get paid.
but she will be paid.
yes, but who is she going to talk to?
I don't know.
but do you think she speaks enough Spanish to do it?
no.
I told her.
sure
I told her.
what else?
and why does it have to be in Spanish?
I don't think so
it has to be bilingual.
but, honestly, I don't believe that a person, that they are bilingual.
in the sense
that Antonio and Diego are bilingual?
I don't think they're bilingual.
no.
no, because understanding, half-understanding or half-reading something doesn't mean that you are bilingual.
that
that's why I say.
I don't have, that's not my concept of bilingualism.
but if we record everything in Spanish, what does it have to do with being bilingual?









or to do what you're doing, that you're talking in English and I'm answering you in Spanish?
something like that, but I don't think so.
honestly I don't think so.
I'm making it interesting.
let them study.
and do you think we can, do you think we can talk for thirty minutes?
yes, you don't, you're not speaking.
I am.
you're not.
I speak when, when there's something, some topic I'm interested in.
I speak.
but you get desperate when I speak because you want me to hurry up.
you don't like it when I start to.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
it's that.
no, let me talk.
you really don't like it when I start giving details and explaining this and that.
you want the point.
you want me to give you the bullet points.
and tell you, ta-ta-ta, it's like that.
and that's it.
it's not like that.
it's when, when you want to say something.
you first tell me.
he got killed.
and then you begin how it was that he got killed.
no because then.
you've already told me that he got killed.
well girl, you don't have to, have to tell me how he died.
no.
and you're like that too.
but that's, that's part of the narration.
don't tell me, don't tell me.
you're creating, like, suspense.
so you're paying attention because.
I don't want it, I don't want suspense.
so now, from now on I won't tell you things.
someone get killed because he had an accident with the motorbike.
that's it.
and then I'm going to ask you for details.
but I feel like you're not interested because I tell you things that interest me and I see from your face that you are not interested.
and that you're only listening out of politeness.
no
well, when you start off about Lorenzo it sometimes doesn't interest me.
but that's my job, it's part of my life.
I'm there nine hours per day.
and I, and I'm telling you because I want to share something about what I do for most of my day which is important for me.
I want to share it with you.
but.
and you're not interested.
but a lot of the time you're not interested in mine either.
so then what am I going to tell you?
that I came here to cook.
that I came to do the laundry.
that I fed the cat.
that.
but there are other things, for example
number one when I've taken you to the museum and shown you a piece that I've done, sometimes you're interested and sometimes like
yes, but I don't interrupt you when you start telling me things, for example about these.
I'm not talking about interrupting.
I'm taking about interest.
I don't hurry you up either.
even if I'm not interested, if I'm not interested, I'm not going to tell you.
well, and so, and.

just like you tell me.
sometimes you don't even let me continue telling you the story.
you're always hurrying me up.
I do let you tell me, story.
no.
I sometimes ask
but you get annoyed with me for asking.
because let me tell you the story, let me tell you the
but it's nothing out of the ordinary that I'm asking you.
it's not extraordinary.
no, but it's not about you asking me.
it's that sometimes you even go like this with your hand for me to hurry up.
because I want to know.
like trying to get it out of me with a spoon.
no.
but it's not to make you hurry up.
it's because I want to know how the thing ends.
what does it have to do with that, it's because I'm interested in knowing how it ends.
well, but then be patient, because when you go and see a two-hour-long movie you're not there going crazy to see how it ends.
ah no.
please, I tell you about what I'm reading, a book.
and you're asleep in two minutes.
and I don't get annoyed.
because you read boring books.
no way, no.
they're not very interesting things,
no, but.
and it's not like you tell me something at ten in the morning, you explain it at eleven at night and I can't resist.
you're not OK.
and when I start to speak, you lose conciousness.
I'm not OK.
because when I go to bed, in five minutes I've already turned around.
and why is that black there again?
because it turned black.
and we never fixed it.
no, no, I painted it.
no you didn't.
the bit you painted is over there.
when the water leaked from the air conditioning it got stained.
but that's the bathroom thing.
I put some Killz there.
you put what?
Killz.
it's a product against mildew.
here?

it's a can that pulls up.
I don't know.
maybe it just kept growing.
I don't think it kept growing.
but the stain stayed.
that has to be painted or repaired.
so?
I want to earn my money.
speak
tell me something.
well now we have to rethink what we are going to do with the two thousand dollars less we are receiving from the income tax.
it's, it's not, it's not, four thousand.
I was expecting three thousand.
I thought that
I thought it was going to be four thousand.
no, last year it was three thousand three hundred.
what we are going to do is pay the card.
what do you think we have to rethink?
there's nothing to rethink.
no, because we had thought about doing the bathroom, doing the roof.
ah, no, that's to pay the card.
I say we have to pay the cards
and, and deal with it.
the bathroom I'll start doing whenever I can.
if, if I take out all that.
I buy the toilet.
I install it.
it's a hundred, a hundred and fifty dollars.
if I start doing it bit by bit, it's not going to come out at, at, at ten thousand dollars, with what those people are asking, two thousand for a bathroom.
it's the labour that's costs most.
I've just saved two thousand dollars painting it.
nothing for it, we have to pay the cards.
I say.
we have to pay all debts.
yes.
I don't want to be in debt.
but it's not only paying, it's also about not spending.
you don't see me spending money.
I'm here every day.
except tomorrow, when I'm going to go to a, to, to watch a movie in Miami Beach in,.
it's called The King of.
with who?
alone.
it's not a movie.
it's a documentary.
it's called The King of Corn.
alone?
yes, I'm going alone.
no-one wants to go with me.
I'd invite you.
but no.
you'll say.
ah, that one's good, that one's not.
what am I going to do with the kids?
that's what it's about.
the first, the first part of the book I read about Omnivores's Dilemma.

that's it.
the industry of
grain.
grain in this country.
and its negative effects.
and how, how, how the grain industry is responsible for, for a certain proportion of the obesity in this country.
ah, today I was reading in an article that came out in the newspaper.
I think it was about Peru.
that, that to.
it seems that the price of wheat is so high to make bread that now they're making bread with, with potato flour.

potato flour, how delicious.
because it's comes out, yes, but it comes out cheaper than using wheat flour.
no, and the, and also wasn't there a, a, a riot about the price of tortillas?
but that was in Mexico.
in Mexico, but also because of the grain.
yes, but you can't make tortillas with potatoes.
no.
but what was I about to tell you, ah, you have to give me some money because I need change,
for the, the meter.

I gave you some.
pardon?
I, you the other day.
the other day.
what did you do,?
that coffee thing, I used it for coffee.
it's, it's true.
I have, like, one dollar fifty in change.
I really need some more, just in case.
but now you can pay with your card, can't you?
I'm not going to use my card.
I did it once, and not
I'd rather coins or a dollar.
in that blue thing, you say?
to begin with, I don't even know if there's any there.

but María already told me where I can park.
close to the place, I showed her where the door was.
it's about two hours, isn't it, more or less,.
she says eight thirty to ten thirty.
but I don't believe it's two.
well, it could be.
a two-hour documentary?
I'll show you.
it's in the Miami, Miami Cinematic, Miami Beach Cinematic, Cinematic, it's called.
Cinematec.
ah, I'm going to tell that guy, maybe he wants to come with me.
or we leave him there with the kids?
yes, of course.
no?
no.
did you leave the, the, the computer up there?
yes, I turned it off.
ah, but I don't know if he'll be interested in this because it's about the United States, right?
what?
the grain thing.
no, but maybe if he doesn't have anything else to do.
and how much is the ticket?
ten dollars
ten dollars to watch a two-hour documentary.
let's see what happens, man.
ah, you know what are they going to show there, if so, I want you to come with me?
the shorts.
the, the shorts, the short films that they nominate for the Oscars.
almost all of them are from other countries.
and they'll show them one after the other.

they're like fifteen, twenty minutes each.
and there's, like, four or five of them.
and they'll show them there all in one night.


I think it's the 29th of March
you know, now I'll show you.
yes, I'd like that.
and it's only ten dollars.
and they're pretty.
I was watching the clips they show when, the ones they put on at the Oscars.
very pretty,
but what are they?
what about?
they're different things.
like short stories?
short stories.
but are they little models?
but different kinds of little models.
the animation is completely different one from the other.
one from Russia, one from,.
but they're very pretty.
there in that same place?
in that place.
I"m going to see if I can find a pamphlet or something.
and we'll go.
I'll see how it goes.
that I also want to see.
there are things to do in, in, in this city.
if you know how to look.
if not, there are still things to do.
there are things to do.
what happens is that when you have kids, you have to look for someone to look after them for you.
if you don't have anyone to take care of them for you for free, you have to pay.
and it gets expensive to hire someone to take care of your kids for you.
talking of that.
so do we have to call tomorrow?
we call.
or we let Antonio ask, that for example it's Antonio.
to Juanita
if Antonio goes to stay with Sebastian.
and Ann can stay there too, right?
and, and Lilian?
at Carlita's.
then she has,.
or maybe that's Carlita's plan.
they are, they two were planing to, from 1st of July.
um, I don't think they'll come out well.
but whatever happens.
but the other day that, that supposedly at the weekends she was to sleep at Jenny's for her birthday, the mother said no, because she'd got bad grades.
that's why, that's why.
it's not reliable with that woman, so I really don't want to do it.
yes.
well, so you call the other and Juanita.
to close the deal.
yes?
yes.
I'll call her.
they never say no to you.
they never say no to me?
no.
you're charming.
Juanita doesn't say no to me, but
neither does Paula.
I don't know, I don't know.
that Paula, she doesn't listen to me.
you're kidding.
it's always, oh Noah, whatever.
never.
yes.
when did you see that
she's always nice to you.
this plate is to one side.
it's to one side,
all of them are to one side.
but are these to the side?
yes.
no, don't do it now, boy
it's going.
that's good
leave it, leave it, it's going to raise dust
I think it should be more to the side
please
it's not going to get any more dusty
I'll clean it
I went in there to clean the day I cleaned the whole place.
what was I going to say?
yes, those people don't listen to me.
maybe Juanita, because the poor thing
bad service, yes, some
and she sees me there working, and with the kids and all.
you're not happy with that because they're women.
isn't that right?
and the other one is not the same.
the other one is lonely too.
but I think the other one moves more.
she works.
and she has her mother there.
she ought to have someone who'll give her love.
that Mauricio is not going to look at her again or
did you tell Mauricio?
no.
it's not that, he's just a boy.
Mauricia has a whole other concept of.
ah, talking of Mauricio, we were looking at.
Lilan put.
I don't know where she found it.
a website similar to the one I found in Washington to see where to go to pass the time.
and it said there the places where you can go to listen to Latino music and dance.
I was today as yesterday the thing is that we both really want to go and see how it is
eh, Bungles becomes a place to dance after I don't know what time.
La Covacha.
and La Coacha.
then I told her.
well I don't know La Coacha because Teresa says.
Covacha.
Covacha.
yes.
and I told her.
I don't know, but it seems to me that this is to go and do a search
get up.
I read in English that it was for hunting.
it's for hunting.
because there's where my, my friend Mauricio goes hunting.
see if they lend it to her.
who did you say that to?
to Teresa.

yeah.
and I don't know if Lilian paid me any attention.
and Teresa, doesn't she have a single friend?
recommended?
for?
to Mauricio.
I don't know.
I really can't introduce anyone to Mauricio because later I feel bad.

yes, when he starts giving her the runaround.
and then he leaves her.
no.
he isn't really trying to mess around.
he tries to, to, to, to be upfront.
he's probably trying to give them the impression that he isn't.
but all the women just see that that the guy is saying.
but how come he says, he says that he doesn't want any compromise?

but deep down does he want to meet someone with whom he can share his life, or not?
or does he intend to remain single for the rest of his life?
no.
I think he wants to find someone, right?
I think he.
I don't know.
but if he goes like I don't want anything to do with anyone then he's never going to find anyone worth the trouble.
that's just it.
look, Mauricio he has always had this old person kind of thinking.
of, of.
and?
and now that he's, like, middle-aged it's even worse.
yes.
he's very, very used to doing his own thing.
yes but that isn't, that doesn't mean.
what he has to do is to be clear.
what is it that he wants?
he wants to continue flitting from one to another until he's just a dirty old man dating a girl.
not a dirty old man, that's unfair.
well
an old ladies man?
everyone has the right to pick and choose
or, or does he really want to find someone he wants to marry and have a, a family with?
well then, it's clear he has to sort out what is is he wants.
it's not like the first woman who happens to cross his path is going to get married to him.
andd it doesn't mean that after three months of dating someone he's going to get married either.
but he should be more open-mnded, so that that panic doesn't emerge which gives him that, that merely mentioning the word marriage freaks him out.
I don't think he freaks out.
I don't think he freaks out.
but I don't want, he doesn't want to be, he doesn't want an hassle.
he doesn't want to risk upheaval.
oh well, if he doesn't want any hassle, then he shouldn't get married.
he doesn't want
why are you angry at me?
because you always say the same, that I give you a lot of hassle.
I've never told you that you.
but you think so.
and I, and I read your mind.
remember I can know how to read your mind.
yes.
aha aha aha.
yes.
the medium.
what's that girl called?
mmhm medium rare.

what's that girl's name?
Alison.
Alison.
Alison Plaza.


definite that,.
and certain that,.
ah yes.
name.
car crash.
who knows what,.
he must be having fun.
very nice.
well yes,, occurred.
I don't know.
I didn't see what time it was when we started.
in numbers.
let's see.
yes.
let's see.
I think here it says twenty-one.
but I don't know if that number is changing.
I don't know, I don't know.
we never speak this much.
that's why I'm telling you that you think we have enough to talk about to spend thirty minutes
but isn't that sad?
yes, it's sad.
but why don't we?
we have nothing to talk about.
so, because we're ugly.
or we're.
I don't know if it's because it gets to a point when
I don't think it's that we don't have anything to talk about.
it's just that we're selecting things.
or unselecting the things we think the other.
well at least that's what happens to me.
that I already know which things don't interest you.
so I say to myself why, why am I going to talk about that?
why am I going to tell him if it's like telling it to a chair because he doesn't care.
I'm suddenly interested?
no, because I've already tried.
and you're not interested, so what's the point?
what sort of thing, give me an example.
like things about my job for example, I know that as soon as I start telling you about the convention.
or when I start telling you about, about, about a project I'm doing, something like that, it's like I lose your attention.
and then mmhm mmhm.
and then whenver you get the chance you change the subject.
and then I say,.
but there are other things to talk about, philosophy, politics
yes, but I'm not always.
for instance, for instance, I'm not always in the mood.
to talk about such abstract things.
sometimes I want to, I want to tell you about what's happening to me, what's worrying me, or what moves me, or what interests me.
but you can tell me that.
yes, but if I start telling you something that interests me, something that, that worries me then you tell me off.
yes, that you worry too much about this you and that you.
no, because everything worries you.
no, but you worry about everything.
but if I tell you something that interests me, for example, about my job, then you get jealous because, yes.
just Lorenzo, just Lorenzo.
but it's that Lorenzo is there.
and your Cubans here and your Cubans there.
then it's like, it's like I don't even feel like telling you
telling me about the Cubans.
I'm not talking about the Cubans.
that's part of my daily routine.
yes.
so
look who showed up.

I'm not going to see to Enrique because he has a trial the week of of the twenty-first.
Lily, it's not true that the mother when she has her baby has to have this baby-related thing.
and only her, honestly?
no, Mum.
so.
you are not listening to me.
no, I am listening to you all too well.
Enrique is not going to be at home preparing for the the
look Natalia, they're there, they've already arrived.
oh my God!
welcome!
they're closing up here.

how are you?
oh, fine.
yes, that's good!
how wonderful!
would you like a glass of water?
would you like a cup of coffee before beginning?
eh?
I want you to have plenty of energy!
I think that his face shows he's agreeing.
yes, he wants coffee, he wants coffee, he wants coffee.
look.
Peter, this is Lorraine, a colleague of mine from work.
she is the one who keeps us organised.
yes, she's doing a
with the wires.
she's doing a postgraduate degree.
and now she has asked me to help her.
and obviously I cant't refuse, because she helps me such a lot in my work.
but it's a nuisance to have this.
no no no no.
so if you.
OK, I'll teach you?
Natalia you're not to go upstairs please because we're going to break off with this.
I'll teach you like this.
no, Mum, I'm not going.
I'm not going going to the garage.
OK.
follow me to the garage.
I have.
first we need to begin with this.
to remove this first.
it's like this there?
and that what.
and it's a colour like this, isn't it?
to finish all this.
what it is, is
and all this?
a similar colour.
OK.
and I bought two gallons.
is there enough?
if we're not looking for another one, yes.
and and this one too.
this part too.
the same colour.
and the alternative colour is going to be this one.
and that one.
so this one is also the same colour of yellow.
OK?
it's easy, see?
then a colour then you expect then a colour for this and this.
where is the mirror.
and then a colour for the kitchen.
because the kitchen isn't anything.
it's only this wall.
the rainbow is already beginning.
no, but it does not stick.
I think.
it's a colour for here and here.
Lorraine afterwards has to come and see how it is.
this is easy, isn't it?
aha.
yes.
and those are the three colours for down here.
and then a colour for my bathroom and a colour for the bathroom of
eh?
this is great.
no, no.
and I have I have a colour sample for Enrique's room, only one wall so that it looks as if it is painted.
but I'm not going to paint the whole room.
only.
one wall.
and that is the fifth or sixth colour.
but I'm going to show you the yellow.
no.
I have to have to be lively to keep up with her.
these are the two colours for for the.
don't touch it.
don't touch it, you.
I know, Mummy.
These are the two yellow colours.
ah.
you see?
yes.
ah.
look, these are the the main ones.
you can begin with these two.
and this is the room with the other colour.
OK, Mummy.
leave this here.
we're not going to touch this now.
yes.
now we'll make you a little cup of coffee.
Lily, now you're going to sit down for a while.
Mum, I'm fine.
no, didn't it give you some pain?
but this is normal.
they are pains that are inside.
what do you know about it?
hold here so that I can go and wash this.


no, really.
oh, and you've recorded this about me, Mummy.
OK.
no, I'll do it.
you sit down, Lilita.
yes, what?
you don't know.
that's five rooms.
it moves, well
aha, bit by bit?
yes, it doesn't weigh a lot.
but the weight is normal.
if that makes sense, what I've said.
the usual.
whatever you can
it doesn't weigh much, but just the usual
but the usual for gentlemen like you, right?
listen.
what
look, I'm sorry, it's up there, I couldn't take the bottles that were left.
because I'm too short.
but there are a few bottles left there that I couldn't get.
I don't know if Lorena can help us
no, no, no, no.
it's going to be left there?
but to that
and this side over here?
on this side over here.
open up here.
up, I couldn't free any space higher up.
but that can be moved, right?
because I couldn't reach it there.
you want us to take it out?
where's the party?
no, no.
hey Lorena, come here please.
no.
oh yes?
but no, it can't be moved.
oh no, it's gonna fall.
no, Lorena come here and help mommy.
look.
see how much we love her?
here.
those are bottles we never use, girl.
you can take it.


Enrique does drink a lot of whiskey.
yes, but that is over there in the kitchen.
no, but we've got lots of whiskey.
those are bottles that were given to him.
and they hardly use them.
so they pile up.
the thing is in our little house we cannot have parties like that because there's not enough room for so many people.
look how many peope are here right now.
well, yes.
aha
but what was funny is that it weighs a lot, but the usual.
pisco, oh
what's that?
the Peruvian drink.
how do you drink that?
oh yes?
with ice and everything?
yes?
but
but that pisco must have been stored in there for ages.
yes, yes, yes, alcohol doesn't
it doesn't go off.
perfect, I do have a lot of books down there.
that's unusual.
there aren't that many.
but they are the usual ones.
that's what is definitely going to make it heavy.
this certainly weighs a lot.
no, laugh
sorry?
oh yes, there's her baby, she's got her baby.
hey Lily, the funny thing here is that every time you move I
I'm sorry mommy.
I've got to start thinking how you are walking so that I can walk.

see?
but, but it's heavy.
that weighs more than the furniture, indeed.
that makes it, but can't you move it a little so that they fit there?
it would break.
because it weighs very little.
you know
no, those, those can be moved.
that's easy.
that's normal.
look, look, it's started to break already.
and if you put it down then it doesn't matter.
no, that is only books
oh there's a space.
what space?
oh it's a photograph.
no, a book.
a book.
about Buddha.
I've got too many books.
you're telling me.
or are you asking me?
but I don't like throwing them out.







you've got
oh look.
see?
it's easy.
I told you.
it's heavy.
but it doesn't weigh as much as she said.
right, then I'm going to
I'm going to make some coffee then.
oh my God.
you want to make it so that I can sit down?
I knew it was finished.
don't worry.
I'll sit down.
no, but where do you keep the, mom, where do you keep the coffee, please?
oh
in the coffee tin.
Lorena, will you take coffee?
yes, she takes coffee.
here's the sugar.
oh.
what's up?
Lily, sit down so that the, the

sit down Lorena, dear.

do you, do you want to play skipping?
oh my God.
oh
so what she said is true, that it only weighed a little.
the usual thing, aha.
you want some light?
it needs some light, right?
ok.
Lily, I can't follow you any longer.
I know mommy.
you turn the light on with that.
then you can turn it on with this switch.
and you can open the.
that's right, you've got it.
hey Lily.


look how quiet he is.


look how quiet he is.











Lily, it it tomorrow that you are going to the doctor?
the appointment is at three.
at three?
yes, but mommy, I'll go alone.
you don't want me to go with you then?
no, no, it's not necessary that you go with me.
oh then I'm not coming tomorrow.
no, no, you may come.
but you don't need to go with me.
oh
I'm coming.
but I won't go with you.
you can come with me if you want to
but it's not necessary.
well, I don't know about Dad, because tomorrow Dad's gotta go to that insurance thing.
I don't know what time he's coming back.
if he's comes back on time for you to go.
so whether that will happen I don't know.
that's why I'm telling you I don't want you to get all stressed.
at what time is your appointment tomorrow?
I told you, at three.
three.
it's the ultrasound, it's at three.
and the I've got the the doctor is coming to see me.
and he's going to examine me
and he's going to see if I'm dilated or not.
after today I think so.
no, I did get a little pain down here.


he was so quiet there.

mommy loves you Pucho.
yes, mommy, I'm going to
Lorena we may have a woman giving birth during graduation.
no.
giving birth because at the speed it's going it ends right now.











Lili is this soda bread?
it's delicious.

who gave it to you?
no, I bought it at Dixie's.
for Saint Patrick's Day.
in Saint, I don't think so.
why didn't you tell me so that I could fetch it?
oh mommy, I didn't think
I love that bread.
I thought so much about Sister Mary.

see that right away, I know it.
if you want
if you want a little piece with butter.
a little piece.
and another piece.
I, eat it, eat it.
and another piece.
take it, take it
no, no, it's too big for me now.
but I love it.
as soon as I saw it I said
oh, this is soda bread.
it's soda bread this too
this is a special Irish bread.
the woman who was my boss, a nun, was, was, oh, Irish.

Irish.
and she always made me this.
and she gave it to me.
and it's so, at least we love it.
but after I came from New York, I haven't eaten it again.
but it's, we really love it.
I think not.
mommy, and did you call her for Saint Patrick's Day?
yes, but I couldn't talk to her.
she wasn't in.
oh well, but you called her.
but I left her.
yes, early in the morning.
it was early, it was on the same day that, no, the day after there was a crane that fell on a building in New York.
yes.
yes, yes, yes.
aha.
yes.
but I called her the next day.
no, no, dear, I'm making coffee, sweetheart
no, thanks.
that.
you want some coffee at last, really, sweetheart?
yes.
you and your dad want some coffee, right?
yes.


















I've just made the cupboards at home.
and the carpenter says
he told me
I have a lot of bother putting them in in accordance with the precise measurementss
but none of the walls are the same.
there are no floors.
then it all ends up after I've already got it all measured.
and it's all the roof, the wall or the floor's fault.
yes.
and here, look.
over here it didn't end up up there.
a part was left there.
oh really?
levelled, aha.
it's not very heavy, right?


as I far as I could I took things forward.

you know, I moved the table a bit.
but nothing could be done beyond that.
mommy, I want a little bit too.
no, of this?
I want to.
well, but don't, don't, but
just a little bit and no more.
to moisten your lips.
to moisten my lips.
I'm gonna give it to you from a spoon.
no, mommy.
is that a little bit?
right.
this coffee is very strong, Lily.
sure.
oh, and how's your wife?
yes?
in which month is her, already in the fourth.
in the fourth, oh my God.


how exciting.
right.
well, the third isn't that exciting.
no, that's mean!
the sleepless nights.
no but be careful because if it's a boy his preferences are going to be different.
then you'll learn new preferences.
Peter, you already have three children?
Peter, when are you going to know?
when are you going to know?
two.
and the sex?
the ultrasound, and then they are going to know the sex.
how exciting.
oh my God
how exciting.
and don't you want another girl.
you want a boy.
no, Peter told me that if it's another girl, he's going to try for the fourth to be a boy.
see?
he smiled back quickly
like saying
Nataly you are talking too much.
my sister-in-law, Lorie.
she told her husband that.
she's got a three year old girl.
and twins.
a boy and a girl.
recently born, they are five months.
and she told her husband
Alberto in a year's time I'd like to try to have another boy.
because they want two girls and two boys
but Alberto
on the contrary, because she's at home and doesn't work.
but her husband arrives home after work
and he is the one who cooks.
she's lucky.
he's the one who cooks because she, with two twins.
no, no, but it's true, it's true.
and she's breastfeeding them so it's a lot of work.
so she says.
and, and I believe her.
no, but it's true, it's true.
no, wait.
then, her husband works all day long with, with FPL.
he's an engineer at FPL.
he arrives home to cook for his wife.
and be with the three-year old girl.
bath her and
yes, but the three year old girl is like four kids.
yes, because she's she's crazy
she's cute
she's gorgeous.
but that girl won't stop.
she's hyperactive.
poor Albert.
huh?
no, no, but she's
no, no, but this girl is super.
no, she's like an earthquake.
she's beyond normal.
she's an earthquake.
sometimes not even that because they have, and sometimes not even that because she drops the bottle.
and then they start crying because she dropped the bottle.
no, but.
your wife works, doesn't she?
yes.
so there's work for the two of you after work.
no, Peter's a good father.
he learnt from his dad.
I think he didn't hear me.
yes, he heard you.
that Peter's a good father because he learnt from his dad.
he kept quiet.
you are the dad.
no, no, he didn't hear, he doesn't want to hear?
I'm going to talk to your wife on Sunday when she goes to Mass.
look at Pucho, how quiet he is, hiding over there.
no, he's beautiful.
Pucho.

Pucho?

but there are lots of concerns.
Pucho slept like a baby last night.



oh yes?
oh God.
what does he wake up for, Peter?

oh.
hey, Lily.
just so you know, honey, but you should buy another coffee machine.
did you hear?
oh, well, yes.
no, no, no, don't worry.
no, yes, because it doesn't have that.
oh no, what we did was.
it's got no handle.
no, we made it in the big one.
you know what, mommy?
why don't you serve the.
yes
mom, and why not the the little cups, the smallest cups.
how many are we?
don't you want some coffee?
because in those the coffee gets cold very quickly.
huh?



Peter, I'm going to give you the coffee.
and can you pass it to your dad?


wait, you know, if I put my hand like this it produces froth.
that's a trick.
no, no, no, you know that at work.
they once told me that if I had trouble with.
he said
no, son, I learnt that from a lady so that in order to have froth you have to do that.

no, no, look, thank God.
and the Virgin.
Lorena, you want a lot, a little?
no, a little, like Lily, right?
you almost have no froth left, Lorena.
Lily, you have to get the big ones because there aren't any of the little ones left.
well, you can give it to me to know.
they all have coffee?
yes.
mommy, serve yourself coffee too.
oh my God.
I don't have small.

Lorena, are you going to work now?

I thought you were free today.


let's see, how much did you give me?
how much did you give me?
it's really too much, what you gave me.
no, it's nothing.
I'm sorry, dear.
but, that's a lot.
please, mommy.
that is not, please, that won't do me any harm, and the baby won't taste it.
well, I'll definitely tell you something.
I'm going to be at the doctor's with your father.
and Enrique is not here.
when you start drinking coffee it takes you
that's better.
you are so cheeky.
the coffee is delicious.
Carmen is worse than you.
oh, so at work you take little sips?
no, but once.
no, if coffee.
and especially this one which is so strong.
watch out, mommy.
Lily, believe what I'm telling you.
no, it's not because of you.
I've been careful every time I by my side.
no, it's not because of you, I don't want this to break.
you, you are moving.
and I'm going backwards so I'm like this.
you didn't even notice.
no, I didn't notice.
you didn't even notice thar you moved with me not by yourself.
oh.
Lorena, so what you're doing today during the day, you don't have to worry about anything with your career, do you?
no, the, Lorena, mommy.
aha.
she knows literature.
she knows languages.
she knows about computers.
she knows.
she is a woman.

she knows a bit about everything, this girl.
that's good, Lorena.
therefore you don't have to put up with anyone.
I don't.
she doesn't have, she really doesn't have to put up with anything or anyone.
and it's your age, darling.




uhuh.

Lily can you walk around, I want to see the color for a moment.
yes, mommy.
I'm sorry, Lorena.
let me see the color.
oh yes, it's almost the same.
yes, it's almost the same.
a little more.
a little darker
stronger
yes, it's nice.
so I didn't want it all yellow.
and that's why I said.
yes, it's more or less the same.
where's the sample?
I mean if.

Lily, the sample, they haven't put it away yet
it looks like.
that's what I wanted, something similar but that.
yes.
it's similar.
it comes out


OK, let's just go over here again.

yes, let's go over there.

you go ahead.
OK.




sit down.
no, I'm not going over there.
look, sit down over there.
I'll sit down over here.
but I'm saying that because of the cables.




















but look, what we can do is the following.
later on you leave the baby with me for two or three days at home.
you paint.
and then when it's done the baby cn just go in.
being away from the baby for two or three days is OK.
forget it.

then when you go running to get slim, take the baby.
and run with the baby.
no, I'll go with a baby carriage.
or you can come.
I can't, I can't stay by myself with the baby, darling.
no, yes, here for an hour.
you are so cheeky.
I told you Enrique quarreled with me because of that.






you should have asked him permission.
what happened is that he didn't quarrel with you because you are pregnant.
no, no, mommy those things, I, no, I didn't want to hear it.
if he doesn't quarrel with you any more.
Enrique has a method for getting things done.
he quarrels
he says no.
and then
you know what, why not.
is he his father's son or my husband's?
the son is identical to my father and his.
he says no first.
he quarrels.
and then he won't listen.
it's going to be done and that's it.
but he quarreled with me anyway.
and I ignored him.
I was here in the kitchen.
it's really advantageous doing so nowadays in fact.
but it's really expensive
you never know what's gonna happen.
it's very expensive
and it's not just for the baby.
but for all the babies we are having.
the cousins and all.
us, the cousins.
it's got a good hundred percent, the baby.
seventy five percent the brother or sister we'd have.
and fifty per cent.
your neighbour is here.

waiting



uhhuh
here it's OK, working.
and here I was
I called
do you have anything on Thursday?
at eleven

I called that phone number dad gave me, the one published in the newspaper.
I called it.
because I got tired of calling the others who told me that.
the guy told me
well, we're getting close to the, more than one hundred thousand.
he asked how much dad's was.
and I told him ninety
he says
well, it's so close.
we could try to see if anyone is interested.
hello?
I called the number of the
that I had already found that same company on the website.
from that article you found.
and the man, the guy, nice guy told me
well, usually, they are more than a hundred thousand
and then he asked me how much yours was.
and I told him it was more than a hundred thousand
and I told him
well, yours is ninety.
and he told me
well, it's so close to a hundred thousand
why don't you come?
it'll cost you nothing.
we can see if there's any bank interested in buying it.
it costs nothing.
so I said to him
well, they haven't told me that if it was it's already more than seventy five and has no value.
no, well, it's not necessarily, you go by the
if they can keep paying.
and they see a life expectancy report.
they can see if it suits them or doesn't suit them.
he told me:
it costs nothing for you to come here, and find out, and that.
then he told me he would make us an appointment on Thursday at eleven in the morning.
do you have anything on?
OK
it's in next to the airport.
yes
they are called, it's a brokers
I haven't called him because Pedro told me:
no, that if they weren't on the list for whatever reason
but as all the rest haven't given me any interest, let me call the number that they have here.
so
so, exactly.
then he said to me
ok, and tell him to bring all the papers he has.
and I said to him
well, he has a specification certificate that the company bought it for him with the ITT
he told me
oh, what a coincidence.
his father-in-law started in the insurance company with something he was doing for the ITT.
uhhuh
and he said exactly.
yes
he told me
it costs you nothing to see if anyone comes to buy it or not.
well, I was reading the policy.
and they give you time.
I mean, you don't have to pay it immediately.
they give you thirty.
exactly thirty days. and, and when it's due, I mean
no, there's no need to pay it instantly at all.
exactly.
exactly, exactly, exactly.
OK, he is.
well the effective date is July.
look here the effective date of your policy was July eighty-five.
yes, yes, yes.
but the, the, the payments, if you don't make them immediately, they don't take it from you.
immediately
I've just read that.
but I don't know where I read it.
I don't know where I read it.
uhhuh
uhhuh, he said
well, it's so close to a hundred thousand
he told me
maybe someone might want to buy it.
they do a life expectancy report for your dad.
to see if, based on people from within his age-group, how much if they die, etc, etc.
I said to him:
well, but that's the same as the Last Rites
he told me
no, that's if the person is expected to live two years or less.
and he told me
it's not the same as what applies to your dad
and I
well, OK.
yes, I will look for it, yes.
half past nine to be there at eleven
that takes
will you be there at eleven?
no, no, no.
it's at eleven



OK
oh, no, let's not get too excited.
you still have to find someone still who's interested in buying it.
well, but for the good he said.
it costs you nothing.
so, if someone is interested.
they are brokers.
that's what they do.
they're not.
yes.
exactly.
I know that they sell insurance policies too.
but now they are also getting involved in, too.
I can't tell him no.

I adore being with my family.

I know, so when they were gonna make the statue he was just this little mini guy, really small like a dwarf.













it's fascinating to be with you and with my aunt, with George and Uncle Dad.




























to speak Spanish or different types of languages.







so to close the conversation, what, how do you feel about your family?







I don't know, they're not into getting together with many people, you know, I mean, there's no
no problem
yes, that's exactly what I was going to say
there's no room for drama, right?
or maybe it's only those two, right?
they never go out or anything
it's not like they were going around saying, I don't know this, I don't know that
and not even, because neither of them goes out, you know, so
if Marcano has never gone out
no, well, yes, well, but, and so she doesn't go out any more, so
so she, like, there's no
I don't know how and where they saw you
because they're always together, you know?
there's no
well, yeah, that's how it is
if you want to be in a relationship it has to be because people
well yes
or whatever, because the guys have totally isolated themselves
well don't let anyone stick their noses in, right? people seem to love getting involved in other people's business
yes, well, I agree
and work, how's it going now, did you end up leaving
no, well, I left
I left early, and after I decided to leave, I stayed for a little while
and they told me that the road is bad, so because I had, like, half an hour that a call
and I was, like, yes, OK then
and what happened then
it's not that bad
he told me go home
what?!
and they paid me the rest of the day, so I don't know
that's fantastic!
it's really good
and you haven't applied yet?
I applied online
I applied with this guy called Ryan, he helped me out over the phone
but he told me that he wasn't going to be hiring for a while
when was it that you applied?
like, in, in, I don't know, like at the beginning of February, or January, around then
apply again
shit, such a dumbass, bro.
there's no
so by the way
they're going to, just wait and see, they'll hire you then
such a dumbass, but there, by the way
yes, I was on the phone with Laian a long time, man
a word and
so in the end weren't you going to get into American Airlines or something like that?
remember that, it's just that, brother, look,
you know that I'm, I get really annoyed by calls in hotels
right.
and now with the calls to American Airlines I'm going to get annoyed heaps more
right, I can imagine, but, well
OK, I mean, they can set you up with a stay in a hotel, you know?
but with a trip or something, if you get it wrong or something, the client can get
yeah, they get angry at you and they yell at youn man, it seems incredible, it's incredible but
but they give you a lot of crap, man
a friend of mine persuaded me to go for Taca
aha
well they pay well
you know, but
they pay well
and the discounts you get
you only pay taxes
oh cool
to travel
no, but a friend of mine that already works there told me this, that it's, like, the most they give you is a discount off the highest rate, I mean, the most expensive rate
so it's like it has its pros and its cons, right?
well yeah, but
and what did you do at the weekend?
what?
what did you do this weekend?
on Friday I went to one of my mate's houses
whose, Manu's?

whose, Manu's?
nah, it wasn't Manu's, but it was in front where Manu
his name's Moncho
and after that we went to Filberto's house
the other guy that was with us in Bahama Breeze
and we were there, and
well, I went to sleep and everything
so we were supposed to go for a drink but in the end I didn't have anything
but all the same I stayed there to sleep
and after that, on Saturday, we went to Manu's house
and we were there for the whole afternoon and night, so, playing board games and messing around.
you know?
then
and on Sunday I didn't do a thing.
I spent the day shut inside
and nothing else
I don't even know what day it is today
and what about you, what did you do?
well you know Landew? Well he came over here to spend some time
and he came with the girlfriend
mmhm
and we went out, the girlfriend, him, me, two friends, and his cousin
so we went to the mall
and afterwards we went to a house party in the house of a friend of his
mmhm
and, whatever
nothing out of the ordinary to tell the truth
I didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
so, yeah, on Sunday, I didn't do anything
and you haven't spoken with Lea?
I spoke with Lea on Saturday, she called me to have a go at me because I didn't go to Din's party
really?
and the truth is that I didn't feel like going
I haven't spoken with her since that time in the Bahamas Brize
really?
like literally, I haven't spoken to her at all
she is busy with her Ruto?
we haven't even chatted or anything

yea, she's busy with Ruto
they're together for good?
well I just can't stand Ruto
I don't get along with him
yeah, me neither
nor Fred

nor Fred?
I get along with Fred
I've known Fred for decades
I've known him since high school
it's not like he's a really good mate of mine or anything
but I get along pretty well with him
but this Ruto, I dunno, he just gives me a bad vibe
and how's that?
I don't know
yeah
if it's good for her
you know
if she loves him and that?
it's her business, sure, but
but let's hope that he doesn't cheat on her
yeah man
because you know that Lea is really sensitive and sentimental
and if the guy cuts her off Lea's going to be a mess
so, yes, no, but the guy has insisted on so much with her, well
it's like, I don't know, as if the girl's growing apart from me by going out with the guy, you know?
yes
so it's like
weel, OK, it's up to her, you know.
she knows that I'm gonna be here whenever she needs me, so, but
absolutely.
but I don't know, whatever.
I spoke with her after Bahama Breeze, I think it was the day after, the day that Filberto, Manu and I went out
oh ok
and so apparently the plan the day of Bahama Breeze was that we would all go out together
mmhm
like, she was there
well she said that yes, she was going to go with us, and whatever
and the girl wanted us to do something really cool and wild, I don't know what.
and so everything, shit, well
wow, okay
we'd planned that
but then, the girl, I don't know, I'm sort of discouraged, so we just chilled out.
oh ok well
so after a litle while
we went to the movies
she told me
and me,
we went and well
I said to her
what?
you already know
she suggested Step Up Two to me.
and this movie, well, it didn't interest me at all.
and so I told her
in the end I think that I would finish going to see Step Up Two
I said to her
but surely Ruto's going to go
well, you know what I think
I said then
who's going to go?
is Ruto going to go?
huh?
apparently you said that Ruto was going to go
yeah I said that
so the film was crappy, but I'm going to finish, I'm going to finish watching it for you.
I said to her
but I know that Ruto is going to go
I said that
so I'd prefer
like, what's the point if you're going to be uncomfortable, right.
so I said to her
enjoy it, have a good time
and she was like ok and whatever
and she never wrote to me again
she didn't even make a damn call
then, like
and when it is again that you're gonna graduate?
in six weeks
you're nearly in Nicaragua
I don't know, man

I don't know hey
look, I'll tell you honestly, I mean, with the studies you've got in Nicaragua, no
no, no, I know
I mean, it's like, I don't know, heaps of stuff is happening in my life at the moment
it's like my life and its direction are changing, you know?
in my opinion you would be better off here
well, I reckon that finally I will end up staying here even though I don't want to, so what the heck.
but you're going for the whole summer over there, right?
nah, I don't think so
I haven't got enough cash for that
how long are you thinking of staying?
it will be up until December, God willing.
so as soon as you graduate, you're going to start looking for work?
yeah, I mean, I like my job at Univision
with that I'm doing pretty well
I wouldn't give it up for anything
I don't know, but I tell you, you're already in your career right?
maybe, I don't know
I mean, at Univision what I'm doing is cooking programs and stuff like that
I'd rather put my studies to one side so as to stay at Univision
well maybe you could do it with Univision, right.
mmm well yeah
I saw that you met the people from Rebelde
I saw it in the photo
so you saw the photos on Facebook?
yeah
no, the thing is that, I mean, the guys always get there.
but they always go with heaps of security, man
and this time they were going with Pedro to his house
so they were like more available
so I could take photos but the camera is always working

well
right
and what plans have you for the weekend?
for this weekend?
on Friday I'm going out with Manu and Filberto
and yeah, I'm not really sure, we're still thinking about what we're gonna do
do you wanna do something together?
yeah, come with us
we wanna do something wild, get it?
sure
Manu, Filberto, Moncho, me and
yeah, count me in, let's go!
ok, i'll let you know, so
let's do something.
it's still not set in stone
and on Saturday my mum's going to Nicaragua
awesome!
well, I don't know
I think we're gonna have a get-together here at home.
or yeah, whatever
so, anyway, I'll let you know
you know you're welcome, yeah
sure, thanks
so we'll see what's up then?
we're still thinking about what we're gonna do on Friday
because these guys are all like, we wanna go out dancing, we wanna do something wild
something wild
yeah, something wild!
and I'm like "fine, ok"
because it's been ages since I danced last, you know.
sure
and so, well, yeah
and
and you haven't got any plans?
nah, at the moment I haven't got any specific plans
I think one of these days one of my best friends from Nicaragua is going to come
do you remember this little guy from Mini-Gente, Armando?
Pocket-Person!
Pocket-Person, that's it!
really?
he's coming on the eighteenth, wait a sec, i'll check which date, man.
no, it's the next week that Armando's coming
so yeah, definitely, when Armando comes I'm going to take him out and everything with us
tell me about this guy, I don't know him
I mean, no-one's ever introduced him to me
but I don't know, it's made me curious to get to know him
he's a good guy, so yeah
he's, look.
you'll laugh your ass off.
he's really funny.
and he's one of my best friends
I've known him since I was little
oh rightactually I think I have him as a friend on Facebook, as Armando Cura
yeah, Armando Cura
yes, I think that, no, no, no, I don't have him.
I think I've added him, yes or no?
well I don't know
so we'll go out, great!
and how long is the guy coming for?
I think he's coming for 10 days
so he's only coming for a little while
yeah, for a little while
he's only coming to spend the spring break here and
so he won't be here for Easter?
he's leaving on the 25th, so must be eight days or something like that
so is he coming for Easter?
yeah, he's coming for Easter, that's all.
don't mess around, these people that are in Nicaragua must be going crazy
I'm coming there
cool, I'm staying by the sea, man.
but he's not in Nicaragua, he's in Mexico
he's in Mexico?
yeah
whatever, in December when I met him in Nicaragua, he was on holidays
he was on holidays
he studies in the Tech Institute of Monterrey
oh ok, well I don't know
Mexico isn't a city I know very well
you know, it's not one of my countries, but shit, yeah
well yeah, I don't know, maybe we'll have a bit of a look around
I told my pal, they're going to laugh theirs asses off when I tell them.
that one of my best friends from Nicaragua, Robert
right.
he's going to come here because he studies in Lincoln
Robert who?
Carrera
do I know him?
no, I don't think you know him.
let me see if I do know him
that name sounds really familiar
I've got him on Facebook, if you look on my Facebook, he's number one
here he is
well, the thing is that they threw him out of college for drinking in class
for doing what?
for drinking guaro
so they told him that
look, you're going to have to do home-schooling
they told him
you're only going to be able to come in to sit exams
and, but, I mean, you can't go, I mean you can't go to the graduation party or the graduation.
damn.
yeah, I know,
that's really shitty
it's horrible
it sucks, man.
can you imagine how bad that would be?
not being able to go to the party nor to graduation is really sad
yes, that's sad, I mean.
the graduation is the worst.
yeah that's what I said
if they were to give me the choice between the party and the graduation, I'd choose the graduation
definitely
that's one time in your life, you knowthere's always going to be a ton of parties
nah, I'd prefer to go to the party
what?
I'd prefer to go to the party
I wouldn't prefer it
it's not
what was I going to say?
something like he ended up sneaking into the party?
yeah that's what actually happened in the end
it's really easy, you sneak in and you don't give a damn what happens, you know?
especially cos they do like a masquerade ball
definitely, it's really
much easier if one does it
at last, and what else?
nothing, well, that's all.
and how much time have we been already?
I don't know, like
I feel like we have spent, like, three days chatting.
and there are still ten to go
ten to go
have you counted them?
yeah
oh fantastic, I thought there was more, don't mess me around
there's ten.
and for 20 dollars chatting for half an hour doesn't do anyone any harm, man.
I'm going to tell him to leave them with me
and I'll give them to you
it's a lie, I'm going to spend them
leave them with me
no no, I'll look after them for you
and I'll give them to you at the weekend
okay sure
hold on, didn't he say that we have to fill in a form or something like that?
and have you got this form?
surely the guy's got it
but he was outside reading, because he said to me
I'm going to go outside
he says to me
so you don't feel uncomfortable
well, like you know, when there's someone who doesn't speak Spanish it's kind of rude to speak Spanish in front of them
yeah
even though he wasn't listening
yeah
so then he said to me
so you feel more comfortable
and you don't feel like you have to speak in English
then he said that
I'm going to go outside to read
he took a magazine with him
and there he was reading outside
yeah but don't you think that it's stupid that we're talking about this?
how?
don't you think that it's stupid we're talking about this in the recording?
no but it's him who knows
he wouldn't understand what we're talking about
but why does he want it?
I haven't got the least idea
just some other thing.
Manrique told me
what did Manrique tell you?
about someone Spanish to, to, to, to help give classes or something like that.
could be
maybe they're trying to see how people communicate, youknow, to, to give a conversation class?
or maybe they're developing a new course or something like that
what do I know
the guy told me that he was working for, I don't know which company, that does research.
something like that he told me
I didn't understand him very well
okay
how gossipy are we Latinos?
yeah, to show how? we are
think about how many people we've talked about
but what's happening is that if someone catches us when we pick on someone, the microphones will burn?
not even God wants that
and the truth is that we haven't spoken badly of anybody
no but in fact we've only been just catching up now so
but no
on what happens in a swanky neighbourhood
no
yeah, what happens in the Reparto Chip?
hey, what movies are on at the moment?
I don't know
I feel like going
but I haven't got any money until Thursday
me neither
so that's why I'm sitting here in front of the computer
and I don't know, I'm looking.
but nothing else.
I'll have a look what there is
and so?
and so.
what else, brother?
well, not a thing, not a thing.
that I was going to tell you and.
did you go to Frost on Thursday with all the guys?
no, I didn't go
why not?
I didn't feel like it
who went?
I don't know
I didn't go either
you don't know that it's been a while since I've gone out, man
okay
wait, Manu is calling me
hello
I'm talking to DP
the thing is, I'm helping
do you remember that I told you that we were going to help a guy to
so they are recording us
yeah, no no, everything's okay,
the guy simply wanted to listen to how we spoke or something like that
like the guy couldn't come
so I have him on speakerphone
but everything's fine
I'm chatting to Tania as well
okay.
no, it's cool, no worries dude.
no
okay well we have some time left.I don't know how much
we were talking the guy for half an hour
and we've got about five minutes left
I'll call you as soon as I finish
come on brother
a hug, love youthinking of you
bye
aha
and so?
well, what were we saying?
about Fronz
I don't know
and where did that thing about Pin happen?
huh?
what happening to talking about Pin?
the stuff about Pin?
yes.
still delighted.
no, no, no, about his birthday at the weekend
it was at Richard Corso's house
I don't know who he is.
huh?
I don't know who he is.
Marla's
ah Xavier, I heard you say Richard Corso
and I.
how stupid would it be if he were called Richard.
meaning Xavier Corso
it's that I've also got a friend called Richard Corso, that's why I made a mistake.
yaquis.
but it was in the house of this guy
and why didn't you go?
because I preferred to go out with Matthew, it had been a while since I saw him
OK.
and besides, Pin isn't my brother either.
OK.
I would have gone only to see him dance
that's a show
why put on Calabria?
Calabria, the guy and
you see?
man, that's hilarious
huh?
eh?
what happened?
that that's hilarious
I told you
OK.
that was during Mariela's birthday yeah?
yes, man.
I think that I deleted that video, I didn't even put it on Facebook, so
it's not worth it
yeah, it's not worth it
okay good.
how boring
and when are you going to Nicaragua?
God willing, until August
God willing?
God willing.
if divine providence supports it
until August, we'll see
what was I going to tell you
man now I don't know what to talk about
I don't know what to say man
huh?
I don't know what to say
like when they are recording you, you don't know what to say
if they weren't recording us, we would be talking so much shit right now
yeah
listen to me
and what happening with Ryan and Ana, are they still into each other?
who knows
well, if it's not on Facebook, it's not official, so let me check.
yes, no, yes, I don't have either of them on Facebook
Ryan Pimons
yeah, he's in a relationship with Eva Hinojosa, so they are still going out
ah okay
I'm going to write to him, by the way.
huh?
I'm going to write on his wall
but he never replies
I don't know
yeah, I can see that the last message was Happy Valentine's Day
yeah
so
he never responds
he doesn't even log in.
yeah yeah
and what are you telling me?
nothing new, honestly
right now I have to pay my mobile bill
I want to see when I'm going to get paid
I think it I get it on.
I hope I get it on Thursday so that I can pay on Thursday itself.
because what day is it today?
today is the 11th
huh?
today's the eleventh
eleventh.
we've got five minutes left before it ends
oh my god, you have been counting
I'm hungry
I hope I get paid today
well, if they don't cut you off.
you.
no, they're not going to cut me off, but
ahh
Pocket person
you see, I'm telling my mates about Armando
what's up with Armando?
nah, that the guy's coming here
it's that we were always looking at him
and we were wondering, like, how old would this guy be, shit, I don't know
the radish goes for the size, then
he's nineteen, Armando
yeah but he looks like ten.
OK.
no, you can tell.
yeah
I don't know, you can tell that the guy's pretty calm, like
actually, I think I've got a photo of him on my profile
I don't know if you've seen it
yeah, I've seen it
I tagged him.
funny funny, yeah that's true
you told me that I had tagged him as pocket person
and that you put Armando Lupa

no, my mates were asking me
seriously, and how, I don't know what, what about?
what can we talk about.
tell me something?
wait.

yeah, him, what more?
eh?
what else?
and when does Tulio come back?
where, I don't know.
I don't even remember that, well, every time that I remember that he's not here
I really need him
I can imagine
I can imagine
the guy was talking to me on the phone, chatting and everything
but, well, it's not the same

so the guy's got his mates there, and that
so the guy was telling me that
call me if you see that I'm chatting at night with my other pal.
he says
and it's not the same
he says to me
I'll tell them about all that shit
and it's not the same
like, afterwards I just start thinking.
and I realize that thank God it's not Miguel
he says
you see that I really need him
but, well, OK.
what can be done?
I think the guy will return in December.
so he was the same as he was right now.
how long was he here?
nearly three months
wow, that's quite a while
yeah
and it felt really quick
it felt like less
but well, yeah
I like told him to come for summer so.
but the guy said he doesn't know
he told me, because if I come for summer it would be for less time, he told me and
and I don't know if it'd be worth it then to come and work, you know, only for a month or something like that.
and that they give him two paycheques, I mean, I don't know.
yeah in one month he can earn his 300
yeah so we'll see if I convince him to come
yeah but it wouldn't be enough to pay the trip
and the stuff that he'll wanna buy and that, get me?
yeah
yeah but who knows
anyway, I'm going to tell him
let's see if I can convince him
yeah
you see
what else?
I'm hungry
me too
my stomach's rumbling
okay, I'm going to leave you now
already, no
wait, the guy hasn't come back yet
I imagine he's taking his time.
sure.
well, yes.
well, let's see what happens.
let's see if I can fill in the form for you
and I don't know
I don't think there's any problem
if not, you can ask me whatever thing, whatever question
and then I'll tell you the answers
no, well yes
no, I imagine that it must be om order to sign at the end or something like that
well I'll give you authority so that you can sign
thanks
I hope it's not long because filling in those long forms pisses me off.
and to read it all
I hate reading man
like no
I don't read
they read to me, I mean.
but well, dude.
I think that he's entertaining, that sonofabitch with that magazine
and what else?
just now I was looking at my phone bill
I've got a call with a friend of mine, Sandra
we spoke for 222 minutes
shit man
how many hours is that?
I mean.
like four hours?
I don't know
you could have done this shit with her, no?
no, she speaks English
oh?
she only speaks English
well, what a pain.
she's Latina
but she doesn't speak Spanish
how stupid.
like how is it that a Latino doesn't speak Spanish, instead of, I don't know
If I were Latino and I didn't speak Spanish, I'd set about learning it
yeah
me too
and it's not only her fault, but also her mum and dad's
yeah
that's something that one has to teach you when you're young
like they're your roots, man.
yeah
but yeah
so yeah
like it's not so much her fault
but yeah now that she's older she should go about learning it
yeah that's what she's gotta do
that's how it is.
that's how it's gotta be
haven't you spoken to Maritza?
eh?
haven't you spoken to Maritza?
no, not at all, look.
I think I wrote in her Facebook but
I forgot, I mean, I forgot to reply to a comment that she left me the other day
huh?
I forgot to reply to a comment that she left me the other day on Facebook
yaquis, but I haven't spoken to her
I haven't even seen her online or anything
like recently there hasn't been anything interesting online
I don't know what's happening
yeah, everything's calmed down
yeah the world of drama is all quiet
like there's, like there's something big beign planned.
some immense success that's coming
hey, did you see Marina Pirone since she arrived.
no neither
I realized today that she's here
I mean, today I realized
yeah I realized since the day she came
she told me a day before
she sent me a comment but I didn't see it
how estupid, she didn't write anything to me
I put her there
you're stupid
I say to her
you didn't tell me that you were already here
yeah
I don't know what's happening to her?
and what else?
well, I don't know
I can't bear the hunger
yeah my tummy is rumbling too
I hope that this guy won't take much longer
nah man
eh?
did he tell you when he was going to come back?
no, I imagine that he must be taking his time
I say no, because.
there he comes
he's already got up
let's see what he says, then.
if he says something
yeah, I just saw that he got up
and that he has already looked at his watch
how stupid, he sat down again
man, but there he is
eh?
that's it.
maybe he started to count since another moment
I don't know
I'm sure the guy started counting from the moment he sat down in the chair there.
certainly
and I'm calling him stupid and all that
and after they go
and they say
he called you stupid
he's driving me nuts, the bastard.
what?
he's driving me nuts, the bastard.
he's going to give you twenty and me twenty
I suppose so
maybe it's 20 for the two of us, sonofabitch, ten and ten
and I'll laugh my ass off.
careful, you're making me laugh hard.
I'm laughing my ass off.
no, we'll see, OK.
it has to be twenty and twenty man
he would have given us fifty, no joke, what a tight guy
yeah
the Brits have money, man
the back of my neck already hurts from supporting the phone with my shoulder
eh?
the back of my neck hurts from holding up the phone with my shoulder
well you're really his maid, hey?
holding up the phone with your shoulder and with the other two hands peeling the manioc
peeling the lot, how boring is it
you're a dick
crazy, a real slave
a real servant
yeah
you're a real domestic
you're washing the floor as well, I'm sure.
you're such a dick.
how crazy
it makes me smile thinking about a friend that disguised herself as a French maid
I'm disguised as a French maid, I don't know what.
everyone don't piss off this chick
the chick just went berserk.
everyone insulting her
I can imagine
I nearly crashed
huh?
because I was going to
I was going out of my house this morning
that but I was crossing the lane or like
it was past six in the morning
the sun hadn't even risen
so changing lanes in the express way
and no joking.
and there was a car next to mine
and I didn't see it
and I only heard that the guy slammed on the brakes and I
yeah?
my heart leapt into my mouth
me too, the other day I nearly crashed
no kidding, we're.
shit, and I'm still with the shit about the cheque
with the shit about what?
with that stuff about the cheque that they gave me on the 31st.
you haven't paid it?
yeah, what's happening is that it still hasn't gone to court
I still don't know if
like he's the lawyer
but I don't know if they're going to give me
you get me?
supposedly the court was going to be on the third, the judgment that is
but they cancelled it
and they haven't given me the new day
they haven't given you a new notice?
no
right
they haven't given me a new notice
well good

and nothing happened.

no way getting drunk before anything happened.
nothing, nothing.
so I say:

yes, here they wait.
you have to go!
and they look at your hand.
oh well, you're not wearing a ring.
no, no.

you do wear it?
yes, yes, I use my ring
today, today, I'm not wearing it.
but I, I use it.
but, well, the funny thing was that those guys who came to talk to us.


and you know, she's pretty.
and she's very attractive.












what a bind









and Flavia, these, these two guys they dropped her like she had butter, you know.
they kicked my friend back.

they didn't speak to her again?













I thought it was going to be that they had run away because you were married.

they really kicked her back.
I could have sworn.
but it was funny because, a, a visual thing you know.
they were, they were the two of them, you know, like um um um um
and when I said married, like that
no!

but you why?
Flavia.
because what they wanted was an affair.
traps, they're traps.
they want an affair.
right!
and they're not interested in commitment to a single woman.
sheesh, men are unbelievable.
what do you think, what do you think?
unbelievable.

I was, but I cannot believe these sonsofbitches!
the thing is that.
oh God.
unbelievable.
and how old were those guys, more or less?
forty six, my age.
oh look.

it's because you don't look like forty six either, Marcela.
no, so it's funny.




after the place with the dirty old men.


as you are so tiny, so slim.
but.
but yesterday they, they made references to my age a few, a few times.

that it was.
I say.
because I'm old, I'm old.
no, there was a funny incident, because eh I was telling them that.
well, I don't know what
and, and I made a joke, like, I want to have.

have plastic surgery.
and, and they turned.











but who said that, the guy?
yes, yes
a man?
he tells me
well, women after, after they turn forty
and they look like they don't
yes, it's true
but, but I'm not forty!
and my friend started to laugh
because really offended.
and how old is your friend?
because he told you that you were forty.
sure, I was really offended as he said I was forty.
I'm not forty, forty-five.
I'm forty-six.
but how come?

how old is she?
she's not forty yet.
no, she's young.
no, she's thirty-seven, I think.
but it's a good age to start.
yes
how old, how many kids does she have?
one.
thirteen.
oh imagine
one, thirteen years old.
much better.
but
what does she do?
she's a teacher.
she's a teacher in the same school where we work together.

and we became friends from work.















you know when you go towards Fort Lauderdale airport?
yes, down there there are some
if you turn left, you go to Fort Lauderdale.
yes, yes, yes, I know, Dania.
if you turn right you go, you go to Dania.
and on the right is Dania.
Dania Beach?
and well



yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
or a place called Jackson's where they sell icecreams.
well, no, no, I haven't been there.
I went there when Carmencita was baptized.
I think Laura's daughter is going to get baptised on Sunday.









Carmen got baptized a year ago.

yes, yes.

yeah I remember she told me.
but she used to live.


yes.



yes.
ok, if you go along that same street as far as Miramar.

that there is Sunset Lakes.

the school where I was.
it's a very up-market neighbourhood there.
I know, yes.
and how's school?

yes?

but is it middle school, or what is it?
no, it's elementary.

yes.
because I'm looking for a school for my niece, middle school.

or middle school, high school.



but.
they have a waiting list, you know?
yes.









and who wants it







what's it called?
it's called Nutley.
and, like, in New Jersey the schools are, they're.

not the counties, like here.

much better.
sure, so the communities are smaller.
the schools are smaller.
but my sister, I don't know why, she believes that it's, that it's bad.












she had a boyfriend.
she wanted to get married again.
Ronnie doesn't learn.
damn, I'd go but I can't,
no, but nobody knows who he is
no, but no, but I said, damn
they're in England
no, she has a boyfriend.
she wanted to get married in April.
this April?
this coming April?



oh yes.
but the ticket costs a thousand dollars.
oh no, girl!
the cheapest one
and now that fuel is going up, it's even more.
yes.
and the taxes are going up.
yes, to Colombia I am paying seven hundred dollars, seven something, seven and something


and Argentina is over there in Patagonia
it's much farther.





but one thousand dollars, the cheapest you can get.
yes, yes, yes, no.
and for Curtis and me it's two thousand dollars just for the tickets.
two thousand dollars.
no, plus hotel bills.
plus whatever you buy.
plus whatever you bring back.
plus you bring back even more.
it would turn out, like, three or four thousand dollars.

easily.
more.

a total of six thousand.
oh my God.
what with one thing and another.
yes, it's always the same.
I'm starting buying five at a time.

and the thing is that, well, I want to go because my mum had a stroke.


she's OK.

but, you know, she needs help.
and I don't know, I think I have to go and see her, you know.
sure.
so what I was thinking of doing was, instead of going now in spring break for a week, going in June during summer vacation.
better to go in June.
much better.
definitely, yes.
that's why I didn't go to Colombia now.














oh Marcela
because no, otherwise I'm going to look fatter.
but you are not fat
damn
no, but if I augment

yes, you're going to look funny
or ridiculous, you know?
those old ricidulous women with
no
you'd look so funny
but all the same, you look, like, not real.
but the mimimum possible so that
yes, yes, yes, I get it, I get it.


but what you say
what the guy was saying
after a certain age, I don't think we should do anything.









yes, yes.
Sean was saying to me, that, he was making fun of Curtis.
who?
Sean.

about his nose, because he's going to have a big nose.
oh honey, he's got a big nose too.
if he's like
if he resembles him or his family or me he's going to have a big nose.
any of them.
any of them.









I was, I mean, I have a big nose
yes, but
but I mean a good snout.







no, no, no because I'd keep quiet then.
but.


oh yes


yes.
no.
no.
but.
but it's that, but the bad thing is that what grows, what keeps growing when you get old are the nose and the ears.
right, and the ears!



well yes.
ears never stop growing.
they never stop growing.

that's the part that does worry me.
the other day I was thinking about that.



I thought about that because it's getting a little more fleshy here.






because when you see those people who have plastic surgery they really look ridiculous.






because this too.
but if you go like that they've got to do the lip again.

yeah, you can tell

yes, their face becomes deformed.
the other day, yes, I was watching TV, the news in Spanish.
and this woman called Edna Smichtz, Edna Smif, Edna, Edna, Edna something on Univisión
and so she said.
I'm Edna Smith
and I say
and where?
and that's not
I mean, she's got nothing to do with the person I had met, I had seen before.


and there was Robert Redford
Robert Redford looks the same

he hasn't had anything done, right?
no, yes.
he's had surgery done?
well, they had shown, they were showing surgery: before-and-after photos.

it was like a poll, right?
that, when do they look better: before or after surgery.

and they all looked better before.


oh yes

yes, I believe you have to grow older with dignity.

yes, because
because you are cheating on yourself and your husband.
well, who cares about the husband?
well yes, what does it matter what he thinks
no, but.

no, but.
no, after so many years.
but, I don't know.
I don't know

yes, I learned that.
but, as I said to my husband, if I didn't do it when I was twenty years old, I'm not going to do it now either.
no, when you turn twenty-five, thirty
but then, you already look like










yes, exactly, if you feel really bad
but if it's more or less,, if you are
or it's done out of vanity or for
or that you feel you don't look that good but
well, but Ronnie is a machine, Ronnie doesn't stop
which, what she got done?
she got
Ronnie got done, she had her breasts done when she was young, well
the breasts
well, I knew her
yes.
but they had gone wrong
and she had to do it again.
now it was
yes.
that pastry there, super.





oh yes?

and I told her.
I would be touching them
touching them
because she showed them to me
and it was, oh, gorgeous.
really?

and how much did it cost her, how much?
like three thousand dollars.

here.


no, here, yes, she did it here.
oh, she did it here?
it was cheap doing it here.
it's cheap.
aha.
because in Colombia.
but she says a clinic in Hialeah that, she doesn't recommend.
oh my God, that's scary.
she did recommend the doctor.
but the clinic a disaster that I don't recommend to anyone.
but it scares me too because you can't save money on that, you know, it's important.



the friend, the sister of this friend I went out with tonight, died in Colombia.
they gave her liposuction.
the sister of the girl you went out with last night died in Colombia due to a liposuction?
yes.

after or during?
afterwards
they gave her a liposuction

a clot.
a clot, no, a little bit of fat went into her bloodstream.
yes.
that's what happened.



and she went to have an operation
and came back, and she didn't come back.
oh no.
those parts like that.
no, I.
I have to do like my friend Christine who is this thin.
no!
she's as thin as a rake, she does so much yoga.
and yoga makes you
yoga makes you thin.
no, she's thin by nature.


and I don't care.



you're good with exercise.
you've turned out fine now, really, because there was a time when, no, you weren't exercising.
yeah, never.
no, no, bu, but

yes, but do you remember, do you remember the car accident I had?












just opposite the television station.






whatever they're doing.
look, what
oh, you go to any class.
yeah.
because exercise machines bore me
do you do Pilates?
machines bore me as well.
I get bored.

same for the bicycle, like a
yes, yes, yes
I like to walk.

I walk, walking there, yes, I enjoy twenty-five minutes
and then immediately do some weights.
no, but if I go walking, I go walking.









and do you do kick-boxing?


yes?
and you go every day?

whenever I can.
oh, you're so sensible!
whenever I can.
that's why you look so pretty
I go whenever I can
thanks but no.



just because.
yes, but, and you feel well too.
you know, I sometimes go, I sometimes go in a bad mood.


and I go.
and I'm tired.
and I don't want to go.
and I'm in a bad mood.










Mario, I think he left.
oh really?
yes.
and, and they put a
well, the one that was in L.A. Fitness before that, no, not L.A. Fitness, in Lady of America where I used to go before.
no, well, I don't know.

and
oh yes, it was very good
and they closed it.
I was told that.
yes.
they closed it.
and
but the guy was really good, yes, I was told that.
yes.
and well, he's now here.
and before that there was a girl who taught belly-dancing.
yes, I know who she is.
she's quite chubby, right?
yes, quite chunky.
like, she was chunky, yes.
yes.
Kayle was her name, I don't know.
yes, yes, yes.
oh no, a brunette.
she had
or Deborah
oh no, I'm wrong
no, I got her mixed up with Susana.
no, I don't know if she's a brunette.
you know she, she has a weird look because she's actually Panamanian.
but she looks exotic.
isn't she Ted's wife?
no.

yes, Colombian, but he lives in Panama.
no, I didn't know.
no, this girl, I don't know, I don't know if she's Panamanian or Nicaraguan.
no, no, go on, keep, keep talking








are you sure, Mick?
are you sure?

because, the other time he invited us
and no-one had invited them
and when we arrived.
no!
and when we arrived

Mick invited us.
but not the parents.
OK, well, Sean and Curtis are in the bedroom
I'm going to tell them that
no,, that bedroom
and so?
no, I was fine
the other time he invited us to the birthday party.
aha.
his mother's, no, I think his mother's.
aha.
and we took a bottle of wine.
oh what a pity

how embarrassing.
Flavia you are
how embarrassing.



I wanted to die




you don't know how embarrassing it was, Flavia.


what topic were we on?
so, we went there and parachuted in
oh right
how embarrassing.
and what did you do, and did you stay?
and I said
so, so, well, then I asked, I said







what were they going to say?

but no, they hadn't invited us at all.



you can't imagine the embarrassment.
oh



oh the








I don't know what we were talking about.
what were we talking about?
about gym classes
oh











yes, no, I was.




Trishia was the girl who was selling






yes.
come on
and I'll help you
and I'll train you for a little while.
and I told her



yes?





and they had that, for quite a long time?
yes, no, I'm gonna wait then.






because, oh yes, hey



exactly
the only thing then they charge you one thing here, another thing there
like twenty-five dollars, yes.

but, how often?


I don't know because, because





and then they put on a processing fee, this
the small print.
twenty dollars.

thirty dollars.
the pity is
and then after that I charge you another hundred in, in, in small print that you aren't, that you don't
that you don't even know what it is.
so you end up paying three hundred.

no, two instead of a hundred and ten, like they were a hundred and seventy, something like that.



yes.

they got them because as they closed



that they can't, they can't cope with everyone.









but.






no, they are good now.
yes?
yeah, today, the class I went to today.
at what time?
at nine thirty.

and girl, what, oh
not today.
today you went out from
you told me so
I couldn't finish one
I couldn't, the
what was it?
aerobics or something.
I hate aerobics.
it's, it's aerobics and body-sculpting


yes.








and, and, and now he is the manager here.






















and the spa is going to be part of the hotel.
I mean the spa and gym is going to be part of the hotel
























because, do you remember?
I mean, they have that place because they were the ones who built it.
I thought that was what they had done.
Dan and Trishia had built that building.
her dad gave that to Trishia as a present.
that was what I understood.

so, how are they doing, how's the business?






because.
no, no, it can't be that Trishia built it.
no?
you know, because yeah they started managing it.


at the beginning, at the beginning.

do you remember that boy?
and then they did it with Lisa.
yes, I remember, it was the gridiron.

gridiron, well, I don't know what it's called.


I think that maybe the the building of the, of the building, constructing the building, it was part of the deal I guess
gridiron, gridiron.


and Dan and Trishia started to.

you know, that I didn't believe that, I believed that Trishia was Dan's mom.
oh, no, no
and an old guy there, there's an old white-haired guy, that it was, that guy was the owner.


no, that's her dad.
he, she is the owner.

that old guy is her dad?
the man, he's her dad.

that, no, she's the owner.
he gave that to her.

yes.

yes
no, it can't be.
yes, yes.
I know that.
I've always known, from the beginning.
a tall, thin old guy with a moustache?
thin, with a moustache, white-haired and wearing glasses?

glasses, yes.
that's Trishia's dad.
she goes for walking with him.


yes, yes, yes I've seen them.

but.








that's weird because she doesn't



















that's weird, right?
it seems.
the other day, I have a friend, I have a friend who's thirty-seven years old.
you know, there, she's not very young but not old either, young, you know.



when we turn forty-two, forty-three, then thirty-seven means young.
right.

and she's had a child recently.
and the girl is really cute.
and they were in Costco.
and they were there with the child's grandma, and her and her mom.
I mean, my friend with her child, the grandma, the husband's mom.


and when they went to, went to the cashier, the woman who was there at the till says
oh, you are the grandma
I mean, to the mom!
to the mom!
oh, what a pity
and she says
no, I'm the mom
oh, but you know how the Granny is
on top of everything, the woman says

wow, well
well, when I was working, when I was working at the other school, I had an assistant, and we were like family.



and there was this man who did, who was the president of the PTA


and my assistant tells him
how's your grandson






well, but it's because people now have








no, not me
that's why I'm not saying a word now
I'd rather say nothing.
I nothing, whether it's fat, thin, pretty or ugly.
nothing, no.
because I say no.
I don't say anything else.
then you get into trouble, you know.

yes, not going through that
no.
that's embarrassing.
and
what nice earrings
these ones?
beautiful.




gorgeous, are they, are they diamonds or?
no, those are Swarovski crystals

those are Swarovski.

yes.
they look like diamonds, don't they?
they look like diamonds, yes.
yes, yes.

they look like.

thanks.














but, but Carmencita had lots of things too.
Carmencita, yes.
Carmencita does have.
oh I have the little things you gave to me when she was small.
yes, to her.
do you remember?

yes.
Carmen used to say, Marcela gave this to you.
the other day I showed it to her.
and she told me
oh mommy, I can't believe it.


if it doesn't fit her.










I'd like to because those things are special
what?
yeah, how's your mother in law?
fine.
I haven't seen her for a long time.
fine, she had one thing after the other
everything happened to her, poor thing.
yes.
well, first, she broke her shoulder and they did an operation on her
and she was pretty bad, depressed for three months

and then she broke her wrist.
and as she had her wrist broken, she couldn't go to Ted's wedding.

and she, the days.
and she went to yours?


no.




and how so?




you look so weak, you died.
that's life.

one day you are there
and the next day you're not.
but
you know that he gave him, they found a tumour in his pancreas?
oh, damn
and they removed it.
I, but look, what happened
so they found cancerous cells in the stomach, no, not in the stomach but in the, in a liquid that got into his stomach.
you know, because the body starts to feel weird




I think that killed him.
that that
I think that killed him.







that the woman got the same, a tumour in the pancreas.
they gave her medication, an experimental one, experimental
experimental.
and the woman died months, three months after that.
and the same happened to the man.
so you see
so I feel sorry for her.
but, but pancreatic cancer, it's hard.
no, and it was not in the pancreas, I'm sorry.
in the kidneys.



because his father.
I've got the wrong organ.
the organ.

kidneys, kidneys, that's not that bad.
no, in the pancreas it does kill you.
yes, it kills you immediately, yes.
well, and Flavia, I'm scared.
of what?

you remember that two summers ago it was the brain?
yes, you told me so.










ok and I visualised that it was dissolving.



and it dissolved, I mean it's gone.
it's gone.


so I have a, frequent urinary infections, urinary tract infections


they did a sonogram, blah, blah, blah, a tumour in, in the spleen
in the spleen.
oh, but that can be removed.
and I didn't know what the spleen, I didn't know what the spleen was.
the spleen.
and this other day, I was saying gall bladder.
but it wasn't the gall bladder.
no, it's the gall bladder.
it's the spleen.
the vesícula is the "gall bladder".
right.

well, but they can't remove it because if they remove the spleen it compromises the immune system.
but the, there are people who had their spleen removed.


cancerous.

that's what I've been told.
the spleen.
the spleen.
I never, I didn't know that.
but what kind of tumour is it?


oh I don't know why I told you that now!

no.
you are going to be worried.
well, no, but, well, the thing is OK, here I am again visualising that the thing goes away






no praying all, all, all, all that can be done, all.



the other day I went to the gynecologist.
and he found a tumour in my uterus.



on a scale from zero to eight
it's not too bad.
you know, it's not


so, on a scale from zero to eight where zero is nothing and eight is the worst, I'm a three



but, you know, because it's one thing after another, after another







oh, damn it!














Let's see what's all this shit this people sent me.

oh my god, what's all this shit?











































































































I do in there, in the little plastic thing.


let's see.

you're worst than a bad comedian
you keep on saying that you're leaving
and you don't go.


but you know a change never hurts.
to get cold? you're crazy.

Chicago too?
were you offered in Chicago, too?

no, you parents are there
Ramón's parents

no, and the elderly's health they already are I mean, thank God my mom and dad are healthy.

look, your sister really helps you a lot
I'll put some more water.
I ran out of water
do you want some water?
you've got water.

you know I don't like broccoli at all
you know do you know how I like it?

cauliflower
those two.
do you know how I eat broccoli?
if it's chopped up in little pieces with a cheese soup.

they're little trees.



alone or with what?


and how do they send them to you?



and how are they brought? and how do they bring all that seafood?







and you have no problem as long as you put that it was frozen.
it's not gonna get wet.



you like loquats?
my mom has a bush with








son of a a son of a yeah.

yeah, yeah, but it hasn't defrosted?








doesn't round either?

yeah, obviously he wroke all the rules

yes
Damn the lid.
what's that?
what's that?

you can't enter into any airport anywhere? or in?
ah, in the



I believe she workbooks?, too.



ah, I forgot that we were supposed to go out to W yesterday to check out the texture.









oh, he did changed the oil and that
what's that?
how much you spent?







damn, that's pretty lame.










































so yes, there's a range.

where the cops practice.
and people that are trainees, the police trainees.




because otherwise you may go deaf.

but you don't really hear it here.
absolutely, you may go deaf.

when I'm coming in here sometimes I hear it.








but if you do it every day you're supposed to, you know, for protection.








so, if you walk a little further, if you walk a little further you'll see they're building and, like, an exercise path for the police officials or police trainees actually.
so you gotta jump, you have to go.

yeah, exactly.

so there you have it, so there's a lot of construction going around here.




great!
it's good to have a place where you can grow because, let's say you're here now.
but tomorrow you may be in a different position.
exactly, you never know.
and all the girls here are very smart.
yes.












and so there, so, in the building one hundred.
there's the command staff.
there's the lieutenant
there's the major.





here there's a girl called Ana and she's very sweet.
and so she is pregnant
oh
and she's not going to be able to come, she's not going to be able to come in for another seven months.




a very young and cute girl
and very able
thank God, God bless her.
exactly.








you helped me a lot


your welcome, honey



it's very difficult nowadays because the street is harsh.
no, everything is bad.
the girls don't know how to behave properly, because the girls nowadays, it's a problem.
exactly.

and,
I don't understand these girls nowadays.



everything is a text message.
exactly.
I tell you the truth, that now we're going to have to do something to know what she's talking about in that text message.
I'm looking, I'll look at it.
yes?


me, no.
no.

no I'm going to ask Ivan to do it for me because.
you because you can't do it, you can't go to it and start checking this?
the thing is, he is such a, an advanced, technically advanced.

yeah, I don't even know to turn it on.
because my telephone, my telephone, you know
no, but yours, you do know
you know plenty about that.
believe it or not, you understand enough.
but as I never got interested in that text message thing, who am I going to talk to now?
well, you've got lots of people who like you.
in text message.
yes, but.


and then they're using their fingers
that fingers thing is going to give them arthritis.
all day long with that, oh my God.
take a look at my phone, I use it much that the face of my phone is already getting done in.


so the problem is that

and then what's the letter, so when you have to press a letter you don't know.
but kids nowadays, they memorize it.

that number seven is a, I don't know, I, G, T, whatever

























you gotta search out an angle because everyone in psychology knows that that doesn't work.
well, for example

for example, two days ago she was being really rude






you know, it's possible.


















perhaps I work with you.
but I try, I try hard not to use that technique.
so, you gimme an example
let's imagine your son tells you, he answers you back
no
what would you do?

for how long do you not speak to him?
well no, I give him the silent treatment.
and he he never gets the silent treatment because he behaves.
but for how long?
one minute, a day, an hour?
no
he instantly knows I'm upset.
and, and he'll ask me
















by talking, people understand each other
right.
but up to now, because he's just fifteen years old, he turns sixteen next month.

God bless him








he told you that?

he's always paying me compliments like that









my oldest son went through a little bit once he got to the point that he was dating


but I don't remember Armand dating except Muni.



but who else did he date here
he never dated anyone here.



but the point to be made is, thank God, he was responsible.

and with all, even he was problematic








and during the week also, I'm putting her to bed earlier recently.
but it's not easy because she doesn't want to go to sleep.










he's tired.
he's tired
for example now that he's into football
how is he with that, he plays everyday football?

















I don't know much about, I don't know, I don't know much about football either.











because in life you have do a bit of everything.
I never learnt to swim nor roller skating.
and, and, and, and I didn't do lots of things in my life because.
me neither.









like, Carmencita has to learn.

let's talk a little bit about Carmencita.
she's gotta learn.





but you know she likes.




beacuse Mother, maybe because Mummy can't take care of her.
Mom can't take care of her.
I understand.

but I wouldn't like to put her in camp because of her friends.

I'm goint to tell you something, her friends

that's why she got angry with me
because this friend of hers that I saw that was with the boy there.




and what did the little boy do?
what could he have done, poor thing?
he stayed still
and did nothing
he stayed still
she took the boy's hand
and put it on her leg.
and what did he do?
he left it there.
poor thing, what was he supposed
poor thing, no.


but thank God, Carmencita is not into that.
good.
no, I've seen nothing.
no, nor me either.
so the other mothers told me that she's not either, they're keeping an eye on her and she's not into that either.
but
but that, nothing, I'm telling you straight.
I was surprised.
I think I'm going to surprise her today because she's going to the park today, she's gonna go to the park today.






























she brought me a book she had read when she was in third grade, I think.


but now the photos you're going to have to make them smaller so that
no, she wants them that big
but what happens if you can't flip?
no, she doesn't want to
she says the teacher did it like that.







the instructions don't work because they say to put it facing upwards and the teacher said that you put it facing downwards.
exactly.




and praise the Lord that you know what you're doing with her, praise God.














you know how many projects she did?
she did so many projects



























I tell her that she, that she has to be really thankful to God that she has you, sister, because you are a very educated woman.

she's good.
and you are a teacher by profession.






but you know the way they do it
yes but these teachers assigning these projects, the kids don't even know if they're coming or going.













now, I don't know, I'd like her to learn swimming




your son?

what do you want him to do?



and he can't work this year.
no.
are they cutting back personnel because there's no money.


there's no money anywhere
and the stress level, gosh.
he's sixteen years old already.
right.
he can work at the library too.
it could be a good work, then
well because of the allergies I wouldn't like it
the books
you know, dust mites, he's very allergic.











but it was very late.
and what did they tell you?
and they already had hired all the persons they needed.









like all the hours you want him to work





but what time more or less, like, from eight to, or nine?









when I'm there next time I'm going to speak to the manager and ask him
he's sixteen years old, right?






exactly
and next to his house.
we'll see.

no.
that's great.




























he knows you.


because if they get cut.
yes.
something may happen.
I don't like it that way.


but I thought maybe instead of the machine then he likes baking.



it can't be done.
because he knows how to do it.
and he's got all the tools.
no, they have their own anyway, so.

he loves baking.





how delicious.

no, I already ate it.
and then I ate it all, one day after the other
and when Carmencita went she said
nothing, I, all.




no, I can take it or leave it.
no, it does nothing for me anyway
what it does do is make you fat
no, I know





and I was reading, you know, that sugar is bad even for cancer because the cancer cells.




it's better.
I didn't know.



you have to tell her.
yes, but you have to tell her that
yes, that part I didn't know



I had an article that someone sent me on, on the internet.

yes, it said everything about that there
you know who's got that, Marcelo.





how is he, OK?


when are you going to see her apartment?
you know, you know, I have no time for that.
you have to go because you're going to,
her mommy
but it's because I don't like heights anyway.










yeah, maybe you can teach her how to swim because she has to learn.
and that

but I can't swim very well.
but there, there nothing will happen, anyway.
but check to see if you can teach her because what happens is that all the parties now in summer, people are gonna learn, people are gonna know how to swim.




you have to know, you have to know because we are surrounded by water.
I hope.


but I don't know what to tell you because she doesn't want to get her face wet.
and I don't know how she's going to learn.
and me, I don't like cold water.
when you go to the swimming pool I don't like it there.
and if you go to the sea, to the ocean.




and of course Carmencita didn't go.
she went but she didn't get into the water.



all of them.
crying and screaming.
and I was happy that my daughter hadn't gone in.
I was not happy because they got hurt.

and I didn't call the mothers to.

I think was urinating, urinating.


but, but all the kids crying because they said it hurt so much.
and Carmencita, you know.
but this is not helping Carmencita either because she is afraid of getting into the water because, you know, she's afraid of everything.




but didn't they have the flag out there?
no.
no?



didn't they have a lifeguard?
no, they didn't.






I'm telling you the truth, consider that thing about sting rates.
that's very dangerous
and now I don't know what's going on.
that they are even coming down to the shores and, oh my God.

because I have great respect for water.

and Nerea loves water







every weekend, his kids.








no, no, no, no.
he loves his boat.
ah but no, lately he's not going anywhere.

to the kids.





no.





do you know Luis is a, is, is, is, knows how to fly.


I don't like anything like that.





I told him.

because I don't go airplane with him.
no.

I went on a, on an airplane that was pint-sized.







Paul in the refrigerator sweetheart there's a thing called an "empanada"








such a delicious restaurant!

it's Colombian and their turnovers





I like cooking.

I like it.


you have to do it.




and Carmencita of course was eating her macaroni and cheese.

she eats what she likes.
she doesn't eat anything that, that would be nutritional for her, you know.
well, she's eating pizza which is cheese and a little bit of the sauce.



the french fries, she eats chicken nuggets.





yeah eventually, I believe, I don't know, I believe she's gonna start eating better.










she loves eating that.
it's that nowadays we're so busy,
I cook in twenty, thirty minutes.
but with the help of a lot of people.
for example, you know, like, for instance today I have already had rosetti.






and how much do you serve to everyone?
so when I say that I have help from other people, I mean that I use frozen vegetables.















I'm not going to wash today.
all the stuff's going to be left there.





no.

no, no, no, no.
no, my fingers really hurt.


I went to the doctor.
and I said to him.

he told me
it doesn't seem to be arthritis.
I told him
but doctor, I have a terrible pain in my finger.








I need to start on my treadmill too.


now that Luis, Luis has been now.
you know he's going to take on the gas station again.
yes.

thank God.











well, that's his business.

that's what he knows.
he knows, let's say, accounting.

and he calculates all that stuff.











Cobra people.
Gog bless him.
you know, he, he knows his business.






poor guy.












oh, you wouldn't know.



he got left that

oh yes, I'm coming, madam.
and they keep me waiting two, three, four hours.
and they don't come.



the condo you have there.
it's not rented either.


how much do you rent the place for?

the condo.
it's two romos?
two rooms.
where Adrian had his apartment?
yes, but mine's much cleaner because it's all neat and painted.
the thing is, it's being fixed.
the building or the apartment?
the building outside is being all renewed, but they haven't reached my unit yet.


I mean the only thing that you can really use is the balcony.



I mean it's astronomical what they are charging.






nobody bothers you.
it's all new inside.

but the bathrooms aren't as modern as those you've got here in, in the condo.
in the condo.











but it seems there're other places in the, in the same area that are probably going to be cheaper.
because he's paying two thousand now.
yes.



and he told him.
come here because there's a building, water and everything.
let's see how much he wants.
if the guy wants two thousand dollars I'm saying no.
you know, though I don't pay it.
Luis is paying but, you know, still.
no, but anyway it's not worth the hassle.
I tell you sincerely.

it's cute.

in fact Luis was gonna move there.
he was going to sell his house.
and he was going to move there.
I think he said he was moving to a condominium.
yes, he was moving in there because it's nice.






but to him
but he likes to work.
but it's stupid,














you are so right.

he likes the people who work for him.

he's happy there though he's got a lot of work.




















let them kill each other doing what I want to do.
a product.
develop the product.
this market it.






I said to the guy, I said to him.







but his hands sweated a lot.
that's what you were getting a patent for, right?
yes.
yes.
so then, I think it would sell.










I don't know, I'm waiting for his response to see what he says.
what do you think?
I think, yes.
I think he's going to love it because











the insurance is really expensive.

do you remember when I stopped working?




that's not possible.
you can't be without insurance






































but you don't annoy him, sis.
so you don't bother.
if he stays like that it would be a miracle from God.
it would.
yes.
I'm telling you the truth.
he came here the other day.
yes.
he met Lola.

so we'll see what
he's a nice person.

I've always told you so.

oh he gave you, I didn't give you the letter?

oh, yes.
and we gave it to the professor and everything.
I was doing another one for Carmencita.
show it to me as she's going to need community hours.



she needs them now for her, I don't know what.











you know how things are there, outside with the children?
I won't let that, please.
no, and you know my daughter wants to go to the park by herself?
I said no.
no.
of course not.
she says that with, with twenty kids and, and two or three parents.
maybe if two or three parents go and, like, maybe ten or fifteen kids.



I'm telling you, it's very hard.



think about it.
no, what I'm saying today is yes.
I, I pick up,
speak to her tomorrow.









we can calculate to see because when you eat out it's expensive

















because I don't want to.
but let, let's, let's see if she wants to do that
and Mom was like, she told her this morning.
and yesterday too.
you know, started.



you see, she's going to get mad at me then because she's my daughter.
with her friends.
no, Mommy prefers her going to the park.
no, I don't want her to go to the park.
but Mommy does.





then look, tomorrow I, tomorrow you are going to do a project with her.

what day is tomorrow?
Saturday?
tomorrow, tomorrow's Friday.
oh, on Friday.
she has no school.

she has no school all day.

you, if you finish the
you think you can finish it tomorrow?



if not, you are going to.












if she finishes all her project on Friday maybe she can go out on Saturday.


or have a friend, not go out, bring a friend home


I don't want either,
no, no that,.
but that's how I was saying originally when we started this conversation I told you that I don't believe in punishment like that






you know I've never punished my daughter.
yes.
this, this would be the first one in years of existence
OK.
but it's just that you've got to do it sometimes.
right, the limit.
she's already reached the limit.
she can't be talking nonsense like that.
no.
no.
no.
let's go, then.



you remember what I said?
and then next week Monday she has to have her teeth done.

I'm going to give you a blind check.
put her braces on.
put them on.
that's something else that's going to annoy her all week.


she wants you to take her today because she wants to show it to her friends.


no, all the kids have them,.
well, that, the good thing is that she's a kid.


she said that she's not gonna give you a hard time or anything.
that she's not going to cry or anything.




so, put them on, put them on her
and then
but the last time she was so good.
right.






Mommy, can I hold your hand, Mommy?








but she needs braces up here.
she's going to have one here.
she told me she's got three teeth which are about to come out.










she won't let me.
she doesn't want me to touch her hair.
or touch her teeth either.
she doesn't want.
before you go, I want to, show you
if Tom's not there, let her show you the part in which she is walking with me in the,
yes.
hey, that's awesome.
I even felt like crying.
oh no.
yes, I felt like crying because.













really tasty, it's Colombian





you were annoying.
yes because you didn't clean the house.
and you were sleeping.
I came over this morning.
and I started to do dish washing.
and the only reason why I didn't finish was because the kid was coming over.
and he wanted milk.
and I went over there to wake myself up.
at what time?
several times.
I'm going to leave.
in the morning?
no.




and he goes he was looking.
he was I love when he uses his hand.

he was looking he was looking.
and and went into the room looking for you.

where is daddy?
I don't know.
he is outside.


















































































































































and I have a headache of this size.








he gave me a lot of kicks last night

















well what else do you want to talk about?






































the bride of









but she doesn't want to bring anybody along.
you know, she goes.








heshe is not good enough.













then we are you know suck with her.
then she um she goes to me.











of course, that's what you want.
um, I told her:
the union is going to kick me out because I'm not.


that but the thing is that
I told her.
that's what you had to do from the beginning.
me yes, but the thing is that I didn't know that she was, you know, certified up to fifth grade.
and they don't check people's paperwork or files.
oh my dear, she is a new principal.

she is
you know.


she doesn't know yet how to access the things or, and how to, you know









then I told her
in that case I can't say anything because it's an administrative decision.
yes, tomorrow they move me from first grade to something I don't really want.
fifth grade like the principal from the other school did to me.

in that case it's her administrative decision that I would do best in this class.










but then that's also something that um our principal told er the principal told me er that she didn't want to be with this person I am going to say how you feel about it and she can think it's because of her.

I said.
perfect.
this way she thinks you are doing her a favour.
and she's not going to be good enough for it.
beacause she told me that over there.
and all those little kids speak.


but they tell her everything.
so that's why the other one couldn't.


and more when when you have you know kids that are the violent ones the ones that
then it happened that yesterday during
she had a meeting.



and then um who came to tell me that, my God?
I think it was Pili.
she came to tell me that one of the kids of that class of hers they found him on the stree barefoot running through the street.
so you can imagine.
the principal complained to them.
and she said.
what what happened.
then the principal went into the classroom, you know, to find out what happened.

then thy had left there was like an electrical cord that didn't keep the door from closing all the way.







because she says that the person that found twou people that found
you know, you can imagine.

you know so they found this little kid without shoes.

er, running around there.
then they brought him back, he says that the gentleman was a Vietnam veteran.
and he said he was almost crying.
because he said it reminded him of the children in Vietnam, you know, running with the bombs and stuff and barefoot.
and you know, he said he was really traumatised with the whole thing.
imagine, it looks horrible on the school.
then she goes:


do you know where the owner was?



she was tidying up as if it had nothing to do with her.

if it's your class where something has happened with your student, aren't you going to be in there so that it won't happen again?
and that's the one who was accused?
yes.



and this isn't the first time that this has happened to her.
in another school, I mean, I would have told her
eventually she will go.
but she is going to pass this problem at someone else.
now the thing is that in fifth grade ESE she is in our building, where she can watch constantly.
and she has people next door.
and she will certainly tell the teachers next door that they should be vigilant, you know.
um, and on top of that she can be constantly checking the
because she is hopeless.

you know, she comes up with things last minute.
she doesn't take this seriously.
ok.
but I told her:
perfect, that is perfect.
because this is exactly what I had told the principal from the beginning.
and I had told her:
we have to put her into a class over here
where we can be around
and you, you know, will walk into the class when required.
then I told her:
listen, no, they're going to sack me.
they're going to sack us for this shit.

you know, because honestly, the union comes second.
for me the first thing
is the children.
is the children.

and anyway that's what the contract says.
that the primary purpose of the educators is the student.

the person that tells me
but besides that she isn't doing anything
of course the two of us know that we want her to go to hell, but
but there she can provide evidence.
because there she has to have things organised well.




















I'm telling in earnest.
I know that Emily really wants to work there or whatever, but


because what happens with Pedrito's things?
they'll come to you.
what will happen to her things?



no, my dad told me so.
my dad told me:
look, you should be glad that they won't give any work to her nor to Paul.
and this girl, well, is already there.
and is Paul very hot-headed?
no, Paul, oof.
they will throw Paul out from a number of places if he isn't careful.
























when we were in the class on Saturday was talking about that










and that teacher didn't do anything.
she was sitting in the classroom, you know what, to eat and to organise the portfolio.
then she asked the guys:










wait.

she also stole things.
I caught her once going through my desk and looking at things.





and my sister had already told me.
a number of people had told me:
be careful not to leave anything valuable because she'll take it.
like a thief.
er, no, and she still is in the system.

and then, when already had done everything, because it takes, you have to document those things for a long time.

when he had everything already, the principal said:
no, I feel embarrassed.
you know.
it was the other principal, not this one.
this one would have sacked her earlier, you know.
if she didn't like her, she would have sacked her.























you have to, you know


invite to some of the celebrations.
and tell sister because if he likes it and she
you know, they get on well.

well, not her, I gotta tell sister
for the coming year, you know, to put him on schedule for to go and celebrate mass.



aren't you hungry?



go and look for something.
on Fridays one can't eat meat.
cheese pie.

a coconut one?
but, well.
we are connected.



just hop in the car and get some pies.


and we'll leave him behind as a baysitter?



oh, tomorrow is the day of shit.


















because that woman, isn't she, even though that's what the guidelines say, you know that she give you full credit for just doing it.
that woman still hasn't given me back my grade on the presentation.
















no but he came because he came to check on my machine.







no but he told me on Sunday because he went to our our mom, my mother in law's house.
I invited him for Easter because I felt sorry that the poor thing was here on his own without family or anything.

he says to me.
oh yes I feel so bad!

and so they bought a suitcase with a briefcase?

I don't believe you.
this ten dollars?
bloody hell it's
who that one?

bloody hell that's that ten dollars only?

what did you eat? what did you order?
how much do you think they were paid for the pictures of the children?
what did they do with that?
they gave it to, with charity I hope?
let me see.


oh please.
please!
let's see, let me see where are the pictures of the house.
the bedroom
let me but
and doesn't he have a lot of children with other people? with other woman?
with the, the Puerto Rican lady.
he likes Puerto Rican ladies.
well he is Puerto Rican too.
oh yes too adult.







wait, wait.
here they have got the same thing that my children have, the medal.
here is the blue one.
and here is the pinky one.
all is white.
very formal.
it's very formal.




wait, wait.




yes, she was big.
fifty pounds.


yes exactly.
no, forget it the next day.



the pink one.
and where is the blue one?
poor Max is surrounded by pinky.


oh please.
forget it, she has about three trainers.
she has a cook!




they didn't, they didn't produce any.
I mean like nothing more than two drops.

my mum says that she tried and tried with the first one.
she was given all sorts of you know shakes and things to
nothing.
nothing.
she says that she tried with the second one.
and, with my sister, she said.


and my sister with neither the oldest or the youngest.


he looks wicked.





oh please.
yes a convertible.
it's gorgeous.




oh please.

but it's a

it, it is a showing off buggy.

but work is relative term.

with two full
what did it say here?


and after all that they said that they are the ones who get up to feed the children.
so what the hell do you employ two women for?
why are you? you are paying them for nothing.
hey!
how wicked!

they look normal, Jackie, please.

don't you remember that was the rumour with Tom Cruise, because there wasn't any pictures of his daughter for almost six months that
do you remember that they said the little girl had.?
oh please.
oh please.





it's just that fraternal twins are not common at all.








but in vitro doesn't mean that the genes aren't theirs.






in fact I was watching the news.
and there was a woman on the news who has had identical triplets.

but they didn't want multiple kids.








she was implanted with only one embryo to see well if it worked well, brilliant.
and they ended up with three identical
three identical
they paint the nails like each of them have a different colored nail painted to they can tell them apart because they're identical.
can you imagine?
and the husband says.



enough!
how?
what's the difference?

why do they Ramona's sweater.
Pam offered that option?

I saw Ramona's one and
she had changed it
and why?
mine were all blue.
hey thanks, Katie, I am grateful because I hate that one.

I saw that in the sweater of




I didn't like it.
I thought that Ramona's one was a mistake.
and you didn't tell him.
María is going to throw it at you!



oh because it's Julia? I know, I know.


oh please!
how corny!
as my sister would say.
yes, because if they sell them for a dollar.
do they sell them for one dollar?
smaller than normal?
do they split it in half?







oh my god.










opposite South Motors.


I'm sending you Joanna Toole's number.











no, but poor little thing, he's only forty five.


Tommy says that he's.






Bonnie likes older men.

poor thing.

imagine.





that I was saying, poor little thing, he's only been here for a month.










that little boy, poor thing.























do you want to go down?


















































they would go great with the white dress my daughter gave me.





































but other than that really white shoes are for old women.
hey, you called me an old woman.






well anyways so my old guy calls me today
well so then he says and the captain
he tells me that the captain threw him under the bus,































but he's so funny because a couple of people have told me that they see him more and more excited.










hello.
no no they're playing upstairs.
but come whenever you want.
hey he tried the asparagus


poor little thing.
poor little thing, yeah, he did.


but he did not like ranch.
the ranch dressing makes him queasy.


he calls it that paste thing.



that paste thing
I don't want to have anything to do with that paste thing.
oh how funny.
he calls it that paste thing.

but the ranch dressing not for or



ok then bye.




I don't like paste!
I don't like paste!




but remember, he's not accustomed to anything that has seasonings or anything like that.












oh, is that spinach?




oh, poor thing.




that
poor thing.



the important thing is is that I think that they all came in a hurry.




hey, you know about these things.
eh what what can I do?
that I have a relative that came from Cuba






























like I was like and then Antonio was like this.








and not to be mean or nothing but it's an over, how do you call it here, like
he is exploited.







well Marta, yeah.

























how






how do you say it?



so he's showing an interest.
































well anyways, so I told him, so a couple of people from work have mentioned that


enthusiastic



















just open it like that, like that.






she has already





and now, and look, was just to stick her head, just to have the door open
yes yes just to



he's really excited.


he's













Carlos is scared of him.
Carlos is scared of him.
look at him.
look at him.
look at him.



























































































































































oh
with the little old men.


you know we've been getting a lot of little old men.

but there's an old woman who is.
poor little thing, you know she's alone.


poor little thing.


but


poor little thing.







no because when I go I'm going to see the doctor again.


Ms So-and-So told you in four weeks.
but I don't understand.
and if I feel bad I can't see him until 4 weeks.

well, of course.





no, no, no, no, but imagine.
because I don't feel any better.





you've come to three, imagine
it's not magic
I hope it'd be magic but it's not like that.
but what I want is to see


results




and the, the x rays are ready.




no, that takes a week.
because I want that sheet.







there's nothing here.
but he is a doctor in Cuba.










and what does that doctor say?
that man says that.
no, because he thinks that I need to have an operation.













because what you want is to have the operation.
yes.
I really think it's the only way.

well, imagine.
I think that, well, it's






well, imagine.
I think he's in the wrong place.
because operating is the last resort for any good doctor even for surgeons.
because one

















you're talking about things that are more sensitive where you have the probability of it not being successful.



look
and you are going to trust him,




are you going to trust well, more a person with no licence here or a person who studied here and has a license here?

which is more valuable?

no but that man is my friend.


it's fine.



well, what that was for.













well


old











he's lifting his leg.





























well, it turns out that the waitress has a crush on him

well, short of taking on, off her clothes and sitting on his lap?

what for?






oh my God she's

crazy!

hey, that's my boyfriend.




no, no, wait.







go into the kitchen for God's sake.
for God's sake!




what a pity.





















no, she's in love.
























what is that girl doing with that old man.























just today.

poor thing, he's only been here seven months from Cuba.




had





no because I've been seven months.












































































































































and I think it has to do with if you're used to seeing someone affectionately.



























it's affection.





























the American.


is he American?
well he's not American.

he just looks American.
















he's has no money.




the rat, the rat has nothing to eat.


but wait.































imagine.
and I pity him.













is she also American?




why do I think that he's American?










what a pity.
no.





hey, send Mona before


































why don't you call animal control?

oh but at the end of the day you know it's just not in my nature.

ugh.





















well, we're almost there.





open it!





open it!












I didn't close the door.


no but remember they're on break.





yes, he's fine.
he is fine.
or else.
no, but he has to bring it back again.
go on.
oh yeah, look.
talk to this guy, it's really interesting.
look, but sit down outside.


this guy speaks Spanish.
we're at the recording.
because she's doing a study of the university.





he is English.
but speaks Spanish
hey, but sit down outside for fifteen minutes.
why not?
there, in the corridor.
but why, why do you insist on the plastic cups?


oh but, now that you're here why don't you get the other cups Marta?
oh.
oh my God, well.














so yeah that made me.

yeah that made me, you know, whatever.




















he made a car port or whatever.
two efficiency.












relatives, whatever.



sit down if you like.


well, well.

no, no, no, it's not

oh, no, no, no, no.




oh!
oh!
open it.
no, no, girl, I told you gently.
leave the door if you like.
open it a little bit.
leave it just like that.
yeah because it's already.
leave it open like that, like that.
there.


so well.
















































no they're not doing the study or anything.
to who?

no, they're there.
no, no, go on.
and that American speaks Spanish too.
he isn't American.
he's English.
yeah, yeah, that one, the English one.
English.


























well.





so Tommy and I go back inside to start tidying up.





but what's your problem?













well.






poor little thing, the dog is a puppy.


now it's, imagine, it lives in an apartment.





















you are now speaking to me at the minute about which version, the Ecuadorian one or the Colombian one?
the Colombian one, they say that they were in hot pursuit
I see
that's why they did not realize
and they had to continue over the border of because they were in pursuit practically at the moment that they went over
and they couldn't let the guy escape
they were chasing them
but the terrorists, were they in Ecuador?
supposedly they crossed over
the Colombian version is that they were in Colombia
and from Colombia they went over into Ecuador


but when you speak to the people from Ecuador, Ecuador says
no.
why?
because when they went to see everything that happened after the bombardment, when they saw then that the people were practically dead or lying on the ground, allegedly they were in their night clothes.

OK
how can you think that you are following them from one country to the other in night clothes?
the Ecuadorian version is that they were camping in Ecuadorian territory
ok
and that the Colombians crossed over the border
and they bombarded them when they were sleeping
excuse me, they did what?
the Colombians
no, before that
hmm?
something, you said a word I didn't understand.
which of all of them?
you said a word I didn't understand
well, the thing is that that is the version that the Colombians are telling
the Ecuadorian version is that they were sleeping.
I see.
so it's whatever it is
thank goodness that after all the bombardment which took place they were able to operate a computer
as for me, I think that's the reason why when the Rio meeting took place which all the presidents were at, Uribe had all the papers and all the aces up his sleeve.
that is why your dear president Correa had to bite his tongue
yours
bite his tongue and say that it's good that the conflict is over.
the same as Chávez and the same as our good friend Noriega.
hmm
OK
that's the version that is supposedly being shuffled around.
it can't be interpreted as if the laptop that they allegedly found which they claimed had evidence proving that Ecuador had links with the FARC was true.
the FARC
exactly
that's why the president then played dumb
sure, because you know what Correa is like.
I see.
Correa thinks he has a monopoly on the truth
and the ONU practically told him
Colombia had no reason to trespass into Ecuador.
correct.
even though they were chasing a terrorist like Reyes who was the first or second in command at FARC.
and just right now to change you have your residence permit don't you?

you don't have your permit?
no, not here.
with this address
no.
you're sure.
ah, my aunt.
I see.


she no longer has to
I needed you to vote for my boss.

ah, but my aunt isn't a citizen.
no, not yet, she still hasn't got there

I'm working for this Antonio López.
he's putting himself forward as commissioner.
for the city of Miramar.
no
so, I'm interested in him winning so that he can keep maintaining his his position
unfortunately Republican.
no
no, not me, I don't go with the Republicans.
I don't even go to church
I don't even go to church with the Republicans.
well, so that's what happened.
you, you didn't see what what Correa did to Uribe?
he stood up.
he practically left him dumb-founded.
and Mr Uribe, in my opinion, a gentleman said to him.
no
if the gentleman, if the president of Ecuador is not facing me, I am going to say absolutely nothing.
and he waited for him.
and he waited for him.
and when Correa sat down, Uribe spoke.
and Uribe was a gentleman because when this man, this one, the one from the Dominican Republic asked him then to please try and reach a consensus, Uribe was the one who got up and went to shake the hand of your president Correa.

he's more your president than mine.
no, girl, I don't consider that, it isn't, it isn't my, it isn't my party in the country.
and you know what he did with the matter of inheritance?
no.
you have a little problem there too.
why?
he's imposing a percentage, a tax of thirty-five percent.
yes?
on inheritance.
for example, God forbid something happens to your Mom.

and you have, for example, let's say, one hundred and fifty thousand in assets.
here or there?
over there, because you have to inherit them over there.
OK.
yeah, sure.
before you can receive them, you have to pay the government the thirty-five percent.
the government grabs it.

because it's a tax that Mr Correa has imposed on fat cats.
and what is it?
and you're considered a fat cat because you have an inheritance of more than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
so, if we want to interpret this, what would be the income limit to be considered?
one hundred and fifty, one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand.
and then you're a fat cat?
if it is less.
it's just less than, less than that there's no problem.
you can receive the inheritance.
but if you have one dollar more than that, you, before he was imposing seventy per cent
and practically everyone in the world was against it.
and supposedly he lowered to thirty-five per cent.
but all that is for people with money.
María told me that.
but.
but, it's not yet.
no, it has already been approved
miss, it has been approved so you'd better get with it.
wow.
get with it because the situation is serious.
I was speaking to my brother as well.
and also I was telling him that I wanted to mention it to my aunt Carla, because of her children.
above all to her, who has many millions in property in Ecuador.
the building, girl, I think it's worth a lot.
in the building.
and at thirty-five per cent, we are talking about a tidy pile, girl
how much are we talking about on two hundred thousand?
are we talking of forty?
a little more than sixty.
on one hundred and fifty thousand, ten percent is fifteen.
it's fifteen and fifteen, forty-five, fifty, around fifty-thousand.
the twenty is thirty.

it's a lot of money
and you know what Clara told me, she practically gave me that, that advice that they're forming, like, a type of property company for everything that's an asset.
like here, a corporation.



I see.
n order to pay less taxes that I didn't know, what I'm gonna do is, you can incorporate yourself, you can be, for instance, Ana López Incorporated.
and you pay fifty per cent of the tax.
instead of paying what you would normally have to pay.
damn, they are taking a lot.

they are taking a lot, those sons of bitches.








yeah but for example, take María, for example.



regarding foreigners, no, I really couldn't tell you.



what's the word in English?
which?
against.

oh, the negative.


no, that's good for her in order to.


aha.
















look at that.



yeah, but you know what?
the problem that I dislike over here is that taxes are too high.



I'm thinking maybe, I don't know, a little bit higher.
generally, tax is always at 2 per cent.
that is to say, if you buy one hundred, one hundred and forty, it will be two thousand eight hundred less the home exemption, around two thousand four hundred, two thousand three-hundred.
it is two hundred dollars in monthly taxes

well, a condominium and all that, the association is already included

it's not separate.
I know, but anyway.
it's easy.
between taxes and homeowners and whatever your martgage is, you would easily have to add another three hundred or four hundred dollars
which is the homeowners insurance and everything.
but that's added to everything, to everything.







it's because that community has had too much vandalism


but, since she was behind.

one thousand one hundred and fifty to this lawyer

nobody got killed?
this lawyer was very, very good, which is why we were at his office, in Plantation
and why we were treated very well.



and so, you went to see the lawyer, yes
yes because the office and all the people at first were a little bit like, you know, thinking that they didn't want to pay.

but nothing daunted, the old chap got up.
José, an influential-looking man.
he has character.
and my respect too.
he said to me.
you cannot tell me nor blame me because it is an automatic payment from a bank that I can't even see from my country.
an account that I have there.
and that supposedly you should be debiting the money automatically.
it wasn't my fault.
it wasn't my problem because I don't live here.

and I come here once a year.

and he said to him.
I am not.
I am not.
he says to me.
denying the responsibility of paying.
I want to pay you.
he told him
and I'm not leaving here if you tell me no, because this is just going to keep on increasing.
I want to pay.
and I want to pay you now.
the lawyer got up
the lawyer got up, and came back in
he brought a paper.
and he made him sign it.
and they excused him the interest.
yes?
yes.
they excused him the interest.
what we couldn't get cancelled was the lawyer's fee.
ah no, as to that, forget it.
that certainly was impossible.
attorney fee and everything, I'm telling you from my own experience
I, excuse me.
I paid several months, accumulated.
and from the attorney's fees, no one saved me.
no, nobody
but thank God it was only a hundred and fifty dollars.




isn't it.
but.

so let's see what'll happen with the market.

no, but supposedly they're doing some, they're going to take some corrective measures
apart from the ones they've already taken.
they are promoting a law to help all the people, because there are too many people whose houses are subject to foreclosure.
in the city of Miramar alone there are one thousand, up until last month, nine hundred houses already in foreclosure.
before foreclosure but that's enough.
yes.
right now, at this moment, at this instant, that's enough.
no, but statistics are worse for this year.
the amount is mind-boggling.
that is going to be.
and that is definitely going to last the whole year.
I think up until 2009.
it's just that we are in the period of elections.
during the period of elections, for any country to make some decision or to head in the right direction, no, it's difficult
until we know who is going to be the leader who will take over in January.

until, more or less, he takes up the reins, we are talking about June 2009.
we'll see what happens.
definitely.
and I think if things turn out the way they are going, McClain, or I don't think that Barack Obama will win.
it seems impossible to me that he'll win.
but I.
you were the one who sent the email which said that he is a terrorist

Muslim, Muslim.
what was, what was the word you told me?
I've already forgotten it, old girl.
but what I can tell you is that they say, I don't know if I read it, that when he had to take an oath or something, because he wasn't here, he was abroad, he took the oath on the Koran.
no, he took it on the Bible.
and that the father, who was, who was from I don't know where over there, abandoned him when he was a year old.
and later the mother also married another man.
and that he was at extremist universities and colleges

he wasn't in any, any Catholic or any located here either.
or a Christian one.
and that really he, he's got all, he's got that whole type of religion.
so I don't know what the religion is called, the one which is the one the extremists practice
I don't remember it well.
but he has very little.
he's very young compared to Hillary who has thirty-five years experience.
McClain has twenty-five years experience.
although he's older, you'd think that he should have more experience.
Hillary has more than he does.
he's a politician
and this Barack Obama, and Barack Obama is very young, I think he scarcely has accumulated even up to ten or fifteen or twenty years.
yes.
furthermore, with regards to his image, with regards to his international image, he doesn't have the same charisma that Hillary Clinton has at the international level.
but, nevertheless a lot of people criticize her.
and it's a shame.
the problem is that she's criticized because she's a woman.
and because she's a woman, it's thought that emotions will come into it
to be, to be president, you can't become emotional.
you have to be pragmatic.
and that is the great defect that women have.
but I also think, if you applied a bit of emotion to the decisions taken by the people who have come to this country, the majority of which, excuse me saying this, have been men, I think that we would obtain a better world that the one we have now.
as for me, I do think that this country deserves a woman as president.
I do believe.
and this woman has all the credentials.
she has everything.
the bad thing for her was that little outburst which took place at the beginning of the elections, which was what practically, well, marred her image a little bit regarding her self-assurance, when that thing between her husband and Mónica happened.

that was the thing that started, as they say, to pull it apart.
and besides that, well, Obama was also partly upset by the, the fact of his inexperience in what is most, has hit him the hardest.

oh yes.
that's it.
let's see what happens with the elections, because anyway, in the end, the thing that's the greatest concern is the future of the kids.
which at the end, when one's already old, or whatever

one's life has already been made.
well let's see what happens.
listen.

you, who spend all day with your head stuck in the internet.

I'm looking for something with the three B's, good, pretty and cheap.











aha.












New York, yeah, we went together.

and I only went to Las Vegas with Alberto.














aha.



but they are dream properties.




they have good deals, but.






but with the taxes and then the ticket coming back.


already that's three hundred dollars.

































oh no, it'll give her a headache.






I've been, I've been there when Alberto was working for Coca Cola.
oh, I haven't told you.


already my aunt told me.
yes.



well.

well, no.
he's going to be a General Electric employee.








but he's going to be working for MSNBC Telemundo




no, I'm telling you.


but it has its pros and cons.










that's what has me frightened.
but which one are you about to buy.
no, right now, the truth is that, you don't know that
the problem is that.
I don't want to even think about it.
but the problem is the type of work he has.
he can't just drive any little car, honey
he's not going to be able to drive a Mercedes nor a luxury car either.
sure, but image is image.

so, let's see.
that's where we're at.
so if you hear of any good deal, because at the dealer where he is, there are cars.
but, so, a Lexus or the equivalent.
I have a good friend who is the owner of a dealership.
if you would like to go and see her.
she's a friend of mine
the owner, owner.
it's a big dealership.
it has three warehouses.
and here close by.
yes?
yes, if you want you can go and visit her.

it's on, over there on.
but what happened to Ana's husband?
is he in Infinity?
and why don't you try?
Infinity.
no, but remember that she bought herself a Mazda there.
it's for him.

to that effect, it would be better for him to buy a Lexus where he is, then.
you already seem just like a Cuban, girl.



no, but.

but why don't they give him a car?











that's what I want to know.
what do you want to look for?



oh, speaking about that Victor, nothing can be done.
no?


poor guy.

sure
they told me so.
a client who went to the office told me.
and I asked him about the case, didn't I?
so I said to him.
look, I have this case.
and he said to me.
my dear, a copy is not going to be acceptable
at the moment of closure.
he'll need it at the moment of closure.




sure
that's it.
the poor guy is screwed.





I've tried, look, I've tried.

but well, if nothing can be done, nothing can be done.
it's the first time they played it, in 1810

it was played and no-one liked it
yes
and, they played it among other pieces
since he had the habit of having so much material to play
and so then it says
has always come long-term
after his first creation he began to establish himself when he was already thirteen, Joseph Joachim
he was a person who knew Beethoven
who Beethoven knew
in memory of
or he played it from memory in London for the first time in 1844
Mendelssohn was there
the composition is incredibly associated with Joachim because he played it there the first time
but Huberman, Adolf, Busch, Szigeti, Milstein, Hogan, Hermann, and others, and no less
but, at any rate, it's the hardest concerto to play
well, that's according according to that writer
but there are other writers who have expressed their opinions
this is what happens
it was that many of those, Beethoven produced music different from that of his time
and he broke the rhythm, the, or, the impressions
he moved from the classic to the romantic
he was the first romantic
in, and, many of his, especially during his period from the middle of the second period of composition
he began to create things different from what Mozart and Haydn had done before
and he began to create romantic things, he
that's why he's considered the first romantic
because
and there's nothing romantic about that man's face
but remember he had already started having hearing problems by then
that he began to go deaf or to be unable to hear well
of course, at the end of the compositions of the third period of his
here they talk about the instance in which he opens with timpani
many questions have been raised, especially seen in contrast with lyricism
but let's see what it says
where's the other?
here it is, here it is
OK
the person writing these notes gets paid a lot of money
yeah
to say words that sound right
and it's not, well, they have to be true for the most part
he began to work during the first years, towards the end
to your
in Bonn
1806 was when he composed that, the concert for
no
it says here 1792, to 92
yes, but that's generally speaking when he began
I don't know
but that's what it says here
but he only wrote two hundred and fifty-nine bars of the first movement
the concert in D was written about fifteen years
it was composed fifteen years later, which means eighteen-oh-
six
exactly
yes, more or less
from1701 to 1806 is fifteen years
yes

in the fall of 1806 Franz Clement who was the boss and orchestra conductor at the Vienna Theater
1802 to 1811
concerto for mercy, for a merciful cousin
violino e editorio to the Vienna Theater
wrote Beethoven in what they call here macaronic
it's placed at the head of the composition
but they don't say
the first movement is especially remarkable
the lack of bravura, I don't know, I consider it more remarkable, that it lacks nothing
yes
and thereby matching the style of Clement's piano
and I have to continue in Spanish
the thing is that I'm translating from one page to the next
well, yes, and here it also talks about its beginning when it, the first time, that it received a lot of criticism
as for me, frankly, when I play it the first five notes I recall is Mozart
yes, because he had Mozart's influence
in an obscure moment I can mistake Mozart for Beethoven
and
and he, of course, the piano was his favorite instrument
but the violin ended up being his second instrument
when he composed many of the pieces, when he was more serious about composition was when he composed quartets for string instruments
there in the concertos and symphonies
with concertos and symphonies
in symphonies, especially, and in the string quartets
I have seen this man many times but
who?


yes
but
you know he has bad legs, I mean
he had polio
polio, yes, but
he has come here many times
but he's never, and he has family here in Miami

but he was born in
he was born in Israel
in Israel
yes
Daniel Barenboim was also born in Israel

but he has done well here
no, but he came here very young because he was brought here so he would be
what was it?
Daniel Barenboim
that Itzhak Perlman

to go to the hospital?
no, no, to go to the conservatory in New York
it's called
what is that called?

it has a special name
yes, that's where most new violinists have come out of, yeah
these kids from the Brown family, where all five children are playing
the one with the piano?

yes
they are there now
also there?
yes, mmhm
it's fantastic how they play
to have five people playing so
the piano so well and
so phenomenally
and playing at the same time
several compositions according to the CDs I have
in one of the CDs they played several compositions, the five of them at the same time
fantastic
a particular combination
yes
they know what it takes
one has
it probably isn't here
one plays the bass
another the melody
another plays other things, I mean
in certain parts, or specials and
the little one was not playing originally
when they had him do it for the first time on Sixty Minutes
the little one wasn't there, only the two boys and the two girls
they
but there are three girls and two boys
there are three girls
well, I know the youngest is a boy
OK, no, well, no
I don't know
no
but now they all seem to
all of them
yes
not the youngest, he looks young still
but all of them
and the mother began to teach them when they were three
oh, I have to call Lisa because I told here the piano is not a toy
and what's the matter?
that he's not
he's not what?
he's not learning?
the boy, the boy
he hasn't taken any classes yet
and it's not so someone can say
oh, that's lovely and it's great that he got a piano
it's something to study
and when I talk to Juan Pablo he gets really serious
he says no
but he does like it
you don't get it
yes
but he doesn't have anyone to tell him how a certain note sounds
yes, that's what's happening there
and Lisa is still looking for a teacher for him
and since the teacher in the building didn't want to do it because she plays at the symphony orchestra
and I don't know what else
she has no time for that
she has no time for that
but there are teachers at school
he's going to an Adventist school
he's going to an Adventist school?
it's costing an arm and a leg, but
who's paying for it?
his mum?
I don't know
the boy's mum?
I don't know
the boy's mum
the mum is Lisa
the father's
I don't know
his father's mum
no, I don't know
she works in another school
but the school she works in is not Adventist

and, but, yes, he likes it, he likes the songs and the
no, he told me he likes the school
he's delighted with the school because he'd never been in that
that type of school
I think he's going to Saturday school
school, not with
it's not the same as school
but I've never been in an Adventist school before
school, because he's still too young to go to school
school, you mean
I don't know
school, it must be a school
school, little school
and he goes very early
and returns very late
but yeah, he likes it
when I spoke to him last time he was delighted with the
and he says, yes, he does play it
and according to
when did you speak to him?
about two or three months ago
at his house?
yes, well, no he was where Steven
and so they were there and they put him on the phone

and
because he loves to talk on the phone
does he?
when the phone rings he says, I want to talk to my aunt
yes, he was telling me he does like that music
but no, all of it is
and Lisa?
according to Lisa, she says he sits down
and plays one record, then another, then another, and another
she never told me that
yes, according to them
and I told her
Lisa, that must be the last thing he hears at night
not that trash and soap operas you're listening to
yes
but you can't control that from here
she controls it there
well, I'm controlling her from here
she has to control from there
they have really made a packet with that song "Time to Say Goodbye"

I think it's on every record of every kind for everybody
that Paul Potts and the English person
I don't know him
is he from England
yes
and he sang in one of his programs like
something about America
it's the same man who
America what?
Americas Idol
oh, "American Idol"
yes
but they don't call it "American Idol" there
they call it
yes, of course, ineach place they give it a different name
something that sounds better
I don't know what they call it there
but it's different
and I think it's strange that that clown of a man wasn't able to say, let's go and find a song for you
for whom?
to be his song
even if it's new
or old
but something new
who, for the singer?
Potts
he's singing "Nessun Dorma" everywhere he goes
he sang for the Queen of England last week

no, the week before last, or in January
and then he was on ABC last week
and sang the same song again

Nessun Dorma is the song that classifies
that characterizes Paverotti
oh, Pavorotti
he shouldn't have chosen that one
yes
I'm not saying that, yes, perhaps he should sing that one more than some other one

but a person who sings so well could be prepared with a song even if it is
which orchestra?
how do you say it?

the one sung by that male quintet, quartet
oh, yeah
that type of song, it doesn't have to be classical or anything
but he's
for example, Pavarotti became famous with that song because he did it so well
and then a lot of people are trying to imitate Pavarotti, and see if they are characterized
well, now Pavarotti is dead, so
so the other song he has is "Time to Say Goodbye"
that one already belongs to someone
he can't be singing that so often
yes, but, well, that
I'm going to have to write a memo to Paul
then he has "Ave Maria", I believe
that's your opinion
not everybody is saying that he doesn't have a song of his own
a song that characterizes him
yes

and he's going to have to go to a dentist too because he has those teeth, piled one on top of the other
or a
maybe a plastic surgeon who can open his lips more so his teeth can fit in

I'm already fixing him up
it makes me laugh because I'm sure many other people have noticed it
yes, and with the money they make, well
yes
and why can't they do it then?
he's well dressed now

that's true
yes, because he has money
he has a good haircut
but the songs have to be changed
because
it already
I'm going to send him a list of the ones I want
he must have something in the
what is it called?
the Internet, where you can send him messages
aha, a
yes a, what is it called?
a

yes, well, it's not a blog, blog is for them to write
a blog is for them to write things in terms more
exactly
I mean, about anything they want to write
but they have to have a place to get messages, criticism
yes, you can write to them there
but that would be your blog for them
yes, but they read it there anyway
they read what he writes
and what people write back
what people reply?
well, yes
I don't know a lot about that
so I'm not going to tell him
he has to get his teeth fixed
he has to get some a bit of sun
well
and he has to find a song that's only for him
and I think that that
do you have a way to do it?
so
yes, I think I
as long as it's not dirty I have no restrictions
yes
oh, that song they sing. "It's Been a Day", it's the end of the
yes
that's the one I think he should sing
well, recommend it
there's one that says it's five o'clock somewhere
maybe you
it's five o'clock some, hm
somewhere it must be five o'clock
I don't believe that, because
yes, yes, it can happen
it can't be five o'clock somewhere at any hour of the day
yes
look at the English empire, it boasted that the sun never set on its whole empire
yes, that's true
yes
the sun never set in all its empire
because they had
exactly
because they had territories in so many places throughout the whole hemisphere
yes
you know those crazy clocks that tell the time
what time is it in France?
what time is it in Egypt?
what?
yes
OK
there are
you set each one at five o'clock, there aren't many places
you must have one for Israel that has different times, I think
oh, London has a different time
yes, there are
Paris has a different time
England has a different time
Japan has a different time
Alaska has a different time
but I don't think there are twenty-four places with
well, yes, because there's space, let's say the ocean
but it's a song
where there are places where there isn't say, a zone
I mean, there isn't a specific place with a zone of
I mean, a place that might be in a zone with a time of
I mean, opposed to Greenwich
so I don't think it's
it's a song by that man who sings normal music
and says somewhere it must be five o'clock
but that's what it means
that somewhere, someplace there must be time to drink
to drink
that's what it means
yes, yes
it's not the clock that says it's five o'clock
yes, it has another meaning entirely
this is what I want the stamp to have
you can do it in a nice way or
no
you have to search out an artist who does that for you
well, I can't find an artist just like that
so each one, and so to put his stamp on distinctive things
yes, well, but there are also letters done more or less in this fashion
there are catalogues
and you have them?
yes
there are catalogues that
I'd have to look for it, I'll bring you it
but then the ink, what color
one
yes, not just any ink?
why?
because maybe someday I want it shiny and another day pink
well, the way to do that is to make it out of rubber
and to have different color inkpads
could it be that in this I can say I feel like going to the toilet?
no, no
why not?
because
it's a natural thing
no
you're going to tell me that
you can hold it until, yes, no, about ten minutes before

then they will have to wait until I can do it

er, Sam tried to get the man to fix his computer because he says it's very slow
the blessed man told him
and I was afraid it was going to do that
and I don't think it's, for the distance
what?
he told him it was too far
that it wasn't worth it
what I think is that perhaps he didn't want to
Sam doesn't like people from Iran
from Iran?

from any of those countries
look, Sam doesn't like Latino people either
no, he doesn't say that about Latino people
yes, when he went
you're lying, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
yes, yes
when he went with me, when I went with him to pick up that furniture
he told me, he said
this Latino people this, and that
no, and Charlie
I wish they were all taken away
no, no, no, no, no Charlie, Freddy
and he loves Freddy like his own mother

it's not true he doesn't love them
but
but he says they're irresponsible, they're liars, they're this and that
that they don't do what they say
yeah, that's true
and that they've caused him a lot of trouble
yes, that's true
he, I've only heard one or two songs by this man
yes, yes, me
and I only like two of Scarlatti's
and I
not by Scarlatti?
yes
because I bought a specific one
and it didn't have what I wanted
but
there are two Scarlatti brothers
father and mother
father and son
no, father and son
but the son played sonatas, only piano sonatas
yes, father and son
and he worked for the kingdom of Spain and Portugal
and only sonatas
well, back then it was the hapsichord
yes
but they were, are, like, very short compositions
yes, mmhm
it's this Domenico
his father was called Lorenzo
wasn't he?
no
I can't remember the father now, but
and they had another, I think they had another brother also who was a musician
but he didn't do a great deal
someone told me the other day
poor thing
no, he was thinking of Bach
he had eleven children
and they were all in the same room
how did he manage to make so many children and music as well?
well, but it was, they had a livelihood
well, especially if they were working for a church or a prince
not him
yes
no, they say he's
Bach
see?
there he is
even so
Bach, he works for
and well, he had parents and siblings who were also musicians
well, he taught at the Leipzig school
but at night he went home
yes, but he was working back then, he was working for a prince
but after that, when he finished that, he went to work at a different church
and he was composing
imagine he had to have a different composition every weekend

Handel too
Haydn too
yes, Haydn too
that must be wearing, right?
but they had a lot of experience
but they often stole from here and there
indeed
well, yes, they all copied one another
I mean, not that they stole, but they copied, let's say
they copied something they already had
and combined it with something new
and Bach took several compositions from Vivaldi
and he also adapted them to his style
oh, I see
what's his name?
in Brazil there's a man who wrote Bachianas Brasileiras
yes
and it's based on
he's a guitarist
what was his name?
I don't know
he was on the radio
I know which one is
Lobo
yes

and very sophisticated
but he also had
he says his compositions had the spirit of the Brazilian people

he composed with the street spirit of the Brazilian people
those people have it so bad
have you heard the violin and guitar compositions by?
and they were supposed to be aristocrats
not guitar
violin and guitar from, who is the violinist we just said?
Paganini?
Paganini?

oh, great
he has some with violin and guitar, yes
violin and guitar
violin
he also, compositions only for guitar
there's a certain Gabriela who plays his music
and
and also Joe's
what's her name?
who was the governor of New York back in nine-eleven?
Giuliani
Giuliani, there's also a composer Giuliani who wrote a lot of compositions for guitar and violin
nice, nice songs, nice pieces
I don't know
I think Juan Pablo should focus first on the piano
because even though you can learn the piano also when you're older
but since now all he has is a piano, he has to learn the piano first
yes
but
but the violin is easier for many
what they have to learn is
no, no, no, no, the violin isn't easy
I'm really sorry
Grace, they, what's the program?

the thing is that the violin
that Japanese program
what is it called?
Suzuki?
Suzuki, but it's not because the violin is easier
it's not easier
it's that they have to learn to read the
one of the violinists says
you can learn the violin, piano at any point in life
but not violin
no, but they learn when they're young
and he doesn't
well, if they learn when they're young with someone worthwile
but I think the teacher Stephen had wasn't
he played maybe four rancheras and a waltz
and that's not, I don't know
but the first thing he has to learn is to read music
it's been proven that the people who learn to play an instrument
to read music, they learn to read
I mean, their brain is developed more quickly for other things and other disciplines in life, or at university or school
well, the thing is that you need a miracle to get something good from where he lives
yes, but he has talent, doesn't he?
a miracle and then something else as well
those with talent get out
and they say, like, Ortil Carrera had a saying
he who is goint to get out
he died, didn't he?
no
why?
who told you he died?
he became a doctor
he died
no
yes, because Esmeralda went to the funeral
when?
I don't remember
it was last year or the year before, someone told me
well, that's news to me
yes, he was swollen, and his kidneys, and something else
who told you that?
and he was married with some other person and
Hillary
and then he told me but he was there with the children

how pretty!














yes?
yes.
but be careful because he may fall.

a bit of glass.


and just with a really tiny piece of glass





but I think that they're high enough so that he doesn't

because if he sees a cat or something he might jump out of the car after the cat.




yes, people, yes.


imagine if he sees a cat.
what is it?





what happened with that volleyball of yours?
how was it?

that you've been admitted to the volleyball team, girl.
who taught you how to play volleyball?

I think it's my passion.




but it was completely different.


but for the first time




and, you know, it wasn't the same.
but now actually get to go into a team where I actually get to play the game.

because I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to, you know, join the team, like, if I was gonna make it.

and they already were.
but your mom told me that the girl before was in the team she didn't make it?





but I thought she was, like, very good.
was she good at playing?
yes, she was good, really good.
good?
and why wasn't she admitted?














and at what time?









oh well yes, because Daddy leaves early for work.
and drops you there.
when he drops you at school, is anybody there?

and the teacher?

and




















where the kids play around that little plank?

that skateboard that I see?






and what time you come down for your practice?


and then you can take a shower there?

and you take clothes to change?

imagine, such a pain.
you have to carry the the clothes in a holdall?

ok, a pair of jeans?

and so for the practice what do you wear, shorts and a t-shirt?

oh, I saw the kneepads.
they're like elastic bands, right, Paula?

I thought they were on a hard plastic shell.

like the ones that people wear for skating.
you know what people wear?


it's more that, hurt yourself.




yes where you play baseball basketball, right?









well we're I'm probably gonna have to start eating at the school.




so, then I'll not be buying any stuff for you this weekend.





yes.
a croissant.
a croissant?
and the meal and the apple juice and the water.

water, Paula, you don't drink water?
maybe I, I can take you some water.


oh my goodness, grandma.





why, that volleyball
your butt hurts?



my God.
you are seriously out of shape.
you are in bad shape.


what are those squats?

let's see, show me.







what's that for?


I think that will also make your butt grow bigger.
I see you
OK, grandma.

and the girls that are in the team, are there any very close friends of yours or not?




and are there many black kids?

two black girls?




no one in the team is in class with you?


tell me, how do you like this school?
how would you rate this school against the previous one?



and the people are so much nicer.



















but more projects.







and how do you learn the spelling of the words?



and history?



yes.







and did you learn?

besides the fact that Russians don't take showers?








when she lives here it's different.
because she now takes baths because here's hot.





oh the Freedom one?








and yeah
and the people there were so nice on the cruise.
and the food, the pizza there was awesome.


and the cookie.
the cookie.

do you remember all the cookies we brought to grandma?

that we kept cookies.
we brought cookies to grandma









the food was.
awesome.
awesome.
we ate so well.










but the food, the blueberry pancakes.
then with the hashbrown casserole two sunny side up eggs.
the toasts.
the the toasts.
and orange juice.
and orange juice.

but then we went for a walk in the mall.
and then you let your food go down.

oh like really nice, Paula.


they are all different.
and we went to Love Culture, which was nice.

we went to Zoomies.
we went to Coldwater Creek.
to Coldwater.

and to Origins.
where else?
I think that was it.
no, and we also went to that jewellery place.

Burkden or something like that?
and we also, we went for a, we were outside looking window shopping in Black and White.
oh, Black and White.
and Ann Taylor.







that was so cute.

yes.






it's very youthful.
it's very springlike, summerlike.
it's cute, really cute.
yeah it's very modern and new.
yes, yes.

a new style now is like flowers and
yes.
and like this that looks as if it doesn't stick to the body because

but now they have a new style that's called neutral that are like the colors
I know it's kind of mean but it's kind of boring colors.


oh well, yes, neutrals are colors that go with anything.











the
what's skinny, and what is that?
skinny jeans are jeans that are very tight.
and they're stretch?

they aren't stretch?

and how are they tight and not stretch?
can't you move then?
can't you sit down?



but doesn't it make you warm?



you have some?


and another pair from Forever Twentyone that are really nice.
what's Forever Twentyone?
it's a store in a, like, in almost every mall in America.


and where do you find that?
in Pembrook Pines mall?




where did you buy it?




they closed Franquitu that's in front of the movies.








they had to close it.
they are taking out all the furniture.
it's been a disaster.



that's because Franquitu was very expensive.
the hotdogs were very expensive then.






and we bought a hotdog for you, a hotdog for me, fries, you had water and I, some of those sweet potatoes, sweet potato, and a tea, and it was like thirteen, fourteen dollars.





and all the Coca Colas you can drink for, for one dollar and fifty cents.

all, yes.

for two or three pesos we go to Cubanito.
like rice, beans, steak or rice and chopped beans.
I'm so hungry.



so Grandma, tell me.
well Paula, you know that next week school is over.
Easter holidays are coming.


Easter's on Sunday.
but as you go a public school they don't link it to religious celebrations.
they put it off for a week.
then, what are you doing that week?
are you coming with me to work?


that's fine.









oh yeah, Joanna's nice.













and that too.
she, she is a good friend of ours, huh?

the pants you were wearing are hers?


and the t-shirt.
from Abercrombie.
oh and the t-shirt too?
which one?
the one you were wearing today?
no, the one I was wearing for sleeping in
oh and for sleep in special.
you wear Joanna's clothes to sleep in.
I'm having.

why you do that, Paula?
and why are you shameless?








she, she's probably not having classes next week, right?


now?

this current week is the spring-break of hers?





you know your uncle this weekend is on a farm.
they have some friends in Gainsville that own a farm that's about twenty acres.
and on that farm they have horses.
and what does "chivo" mean?






and they have a donkey, a mule.


they have a donkey.
and then the lady was going on a journey.
and Annabel and Jaime they were going to go there and take care of all the animals.


they might bite him.
the mule might bite your uncle.
I don't think so.
and the dogs were going to fight them.

but he told me yesterday that it was kind of cold.
that it was cold.








and your uncle sent by mail a CD with all the photos from Ecuador.
do you remember that day when we say the?

to see them again.
and tell me.








any moment now they will call us saying that we are about to have another baby in the family.



yes, we have to go to Gainsville to meet the baby.

we have to go to Gainsville.
they are doing the kitchen.

from there they did the yard.
they installed a wooden deck.
it was nice, the yard.
and they are doing the kitchen.
when they finish the kitchen we are going there one weekend to see all they did to the house.
they have made the wooden deck.







it looks like a little doll's house.
but it's so cute




and.
even though Angie, their little dog, was eating the flowers.
she eats all the flowers.
she leaves the bushes without flowers.
that Angie, she's a trip.







yes.
she
and when we're sitting on the sofa, Eduardo and me to us.
she has never lain on you at the house.






hey, tonight is Don Francisco.
you haven't seen the show Don Francisco for a while.
no, but you know

the other day I was in that play, the one you saw me in.











oh Paula, all the actors starve, sweetheart.
they starve for two reasons.

first, for not having money.
second, because you have to be slim.
your grandma Ana is always on a diet.
hah, Ana is getting skinnier by the day.
oh my God, Ana is so skinny.


how much does Ana weigh?
I think that a hundred pounds.





yes, your aunt weighs a little more.
so grandma.
who to you artist?









you know once you start shaving, it grows back thicker and thicker.

you better do that thing that way

of waxing.
yes, dear.
because when you wax your hair gets soft.
but when you shave it gets hard, hard, hard.








oh, Paula.


my God
so you wanna be an artist?
imagine dying from starvation.
me.


because all the artists have to be slim, dear the television.
look poor Don Francisco, Don Francisco eats only pitta bread with chicken.
that poor man feathers come out.
because he only eats pitta bread, piitta bread and chicken.
speaking of chicken have you been to Chick-fil-A?

you have to go there, Grandma.


Grandpa was there.
Grandpa liked it.
but I don't know.
I don't know
I never thought of going for one day, they go
but I never thought about it.
what eat today because I'm hungry.


if we've eaten, what time was it, at ten past one or five in the evening, and I ate a bread roll.





you're a monster, Grandma.



well, they're, when people are hungry they become monsters, you know.





yeah?
let's see if I see the
that girl?

she'll be there for sure because it's her house.
so Paula, it'll be better if you go home to sleep

and get settled at home tomorrow.
because Eva is coming tomorrow to make.
so why is Eva leaving?
so I'll call you?
I wanted to go tomorrow to church so I don't have to go on Sunday.






because otherwise we have to get up too early.

because maybe, if you're coming with us to the party this Saturday we're gonna come back late.
you have to sleep at home.
so we get up on Sunday.
we go to Mass.

and if you want I take home or if.

yes.

but I wanna go to Mass on Sunday.
I know but.
the good thing would be to go tomorrow.
tomorrow is Saturday.
let's see if we can go to that Mass at half past five.
yes, Eva is coming to both.
let's go then at half past five.
we could go to the half past five Mass, at half past six.
so we don't have to go to Mass on Sunday.
what time is it Grandma?



and, let's see.
tell me.

oh, Paula, that cruise is gonna be fantastic.
look, we fly from Miami London.







I mean the boat.







what is it called?
the ship.
the ship, the ship, the ship.
the ship, yes.
so the first day the ship goes off in the evening, like, at five in the evening.
and crosses the channel till it reaches France.
so


and crosses.
and then we go to France.
so in France Grandpa and I buy a ticket.
because the tour lasts, like, ten hours and a half.
and they're gonna take us from the port to Paris.
so that day we have, it includes a boat-trip along the river Seine.
and there you can see the Eiffel Tower.
you can see Notre Dame church.
we see the Triumphal Arch.
and what's this important museum called?

the Louvre, the Louvre.

two years ago when I was with Rose in Belgium and France we went to the Louvre.
and so we go, the tour covers.
it's in that famous church called la Sagrada Familia, la Sagrada, no, the Sacré Coeur which is beautiful, beautiful
what do you want me to bring you from the trip?


so.
no, bring me those cookies they serve for the snack for the, the cookies and tea.


you know that, and this last trip we went to El Costa?
one day we were looking for you, I don't know if for you or David, or we were looking for Rick and Diana.
















so after we go to Paris the ship stops in a port called Le Havre in the south of France.
then it crosses to Spain.
stops in Bilbao.
stops in Gijon.
then it goes to Lisbon.
Lisbon.

then we go to Lisbon.
Lisbon is in Portugal.
and I'm, I really want to get to know Lisbon.
that's one of the things that most me.
and where's that again?
in Portugal.

OK, so then it goes
I don't remember what the ports in the south are called.
but it goes to Sevilla.
it goes to Valencia.
and it finishes in Barcelona.

so I come back here from Barcelona on Mother's Day.
Mother's Day is the day the cruise finishes.
and we come back here.


it's going to be a little cold.

it's with Celebrity Cruises.





yes.

and they make desserts.
the desserts Celebrity makes
take a look, Celebrity has a five-star kitchen.
the chefs from Celebrity are the very best.


we have gone with Celebrity on one which took fourteen days to cross the Panama Canal and another one we also went on for fourteen days.
It departed from Buenos Aires.
and ended in Chile.
and it went past the South Pole.
and we saw Antarctica.
and we saw the.
what is that called?
the glaciers.
beautiful.
but the food is great.
speaking of Chile, have you spoken to Rodrigo and.
Rodrigo was, is here.
Rodrigo was here the whole week.
he's leaving tomorrow.
or he leaves tonight.
and the girls were here all during January and February.
but they're at school now.








again.


their summer's in December, January.
December, January, February.

and ours is: June, July, or July, August.
half of June, a bit of June.

yes, their summer, the opposite to ours.
for us it's summer in June, July, August.
and for them it's in December, January, February.
because they are in the southern tip




but, in December it's, is it hot over there?

in December it's very hot.


in September it starts getting a bit hot.
September, October, like Spring.
but in December, January it's really hot, like 100 degrees there.
and in what month do you think it gets cold over there.
no, oh look, they left in March, right?
we are still in March.
now in April or May it's already starting to get cold because it's autumn.
but then in August while here's so hot, July and August, there it's cold, cold, cold, cold.
it's the other way around for us.
when we are very hot, they are very cold.
and when we are really cold?
they, well, we are never really cold.
really.
well, you know.


oh, when, eight people, you're going to Disney in May right?



oh, and then I, on the fourth of July I'll be back in Disney again.

yeah we're going to go then with the American and the lad


that now his son is in Virginia or West Virginia with

so he goes to school?

with who?




but his mom's or his dad's?

oh great.












oh he's young.
he's still a little boy.
yes.
he's very little.
and the American's already married?

in the summer?

and where, there in Texas or here in Florida.


yes?

great.






is he fat or thin?


but fat or thin?








it's ok.





























































go ahead.

go ahead.












































































































































































































































































































































































































my eyes, just water and stuff, I don't know why, but we went and, bro, I got so much sun, like, so bad, really, really bad, like, my eyes got so swollen












































































and she just looks at me and she goes, that's exactly what I needed for my birthday, like one hour.


























and he's like "how much does it hurt you".















































and my boss said, oh, go to the hospital, go to the hospital, are you crazy, like




















































































well, and what do you think about what they are doing here to the block?
that little roundabout, do you like that?
but that's illegal.
that roundabout it's illegal.

based on that, it's illegal.
and if any truck goes in there, for example to leave off furniture or anything.
I don't know.
how is it going to take that little roundabout?
because it's not easy for our own cars.
no.
no but.
not so much this side, but the left-hand side.
the entrance one or the exit one?
when you enter.

so, that's on the intersection.
that one has enough space
the drawback, I find the other more difficult because it's narrower.
but did you see the thingies they bought for the speed bumps?
did you see what are they going to do?
no.
you didn't see a.
yes those tiny blocks.
those tiny blocks, to place them in the middle.
yes.
where those little boards were before.
in what they made out of concrete.
right.
but, but that is going to be, like, a small piece of, of, of tile there.
yes, but maybe.
but I don't think that will be much of a speed bump.
indeed.
I actually think that this is really going to be, like, an ornament, but.
is the speed lower there?
but they're not going to do the street, are they?
yes, they're going to tarmac it.
but I really don't understand.
why it has to be tarmacced first before laying out the grass.
well.
no, as far as I know.
yes, yes, yes, no, you're right.
the tarmac was.
they're, they're spending double the money there.
the tarmac was supposed to be done first.
they would have cleaned up all the tarmac leftovers and all that stuff.
so then, sown the grass.
tidied up.
cleaned.
and then finished and whatever.
but anyway, they have their own ideas.
and did you see what they're going to do with the little park?
behind here?
the little park.
no, I didn't notice.
didn't you notice that they sent you a paper today with all the stuff about the meeting?
no, no, it was at the door.
when we left to go to the bicycle shop.

it was put at the door and I threw it inside the house and we left.
and now I just saw that he took it out of the mailbox.
but I hadn't paid attention, I haven't paid any attention to what's inside.
the weather's nice.


so nice.
yes.
let me tell you, this terrace is worth the price of the house
space.
even considering you haven't got a, what's it called, a hammock or whatever.
a hammock?
a hammock.
no.
why didn't you get one?
there, look, you can put it there between the two palm trees.
yes, you could put one there.
I have one that every time we go camping, we take it.

but not here, we didn't think of doing that here, because what happens is that, the ground in the back, it's slanted.



but if a pair of tubes could be put there, or something, so we could install the hammock.









well, we.










which had been on sale since April.
the old guy had died.
it was on sale since April.
yeah, I remember.
they had lowered the price a lot.
and so, like, in August when we found the house they had lowered the price again.
and so we negotiated with the daughter of Lucía, the lady who lives here.

and we got it, but.






and now we're going to do up the bathroom.

because the bathroom is the original one.
we're going to redo the bathroom.

and change everything else.
but now, the new idea is going to be that we are going to replace everything.




oh, OK.




change the walls, take off the walls, put those new dry walls.
so that it doesn't let humidity show.

so that they're, like, waterproof.

and, then too.
they'll raise the tiles, the bricks
on up.
until, up to the roof.
and here before it was half-way.
yes, now they are more or less at the same level as the window.

and there are some places around the toilet that are really low.
so take them up.
after we do one, we might do the other.
and so then now I want to, the irrigation, the sprinkler system, fix it and
begin by retiring.
today we went to see a camper, an RV

yes.
yes because that one, the one we have is nice.












you don't even have mmhm.



















































did you see.

Pepita's rabbit.
it's a little rabbit?




and that was her companion.





oh, how pretty








that one, she got it.




a real pig, the, with a big belly?








really?














yes.

exactly the same is happening to us.








yes.
now one advantage I have is that since Pepita is working for the county she's going to be independent.






no that's not bad, but right now.





oh, OK.











but.

but you know, I don't agree with him.







you know?



you know?
let's bring it back to where we are, where we are now.
you know, a basic thing, the necessary.
answer it, answer it if you want to.
so you can speak a little.




I'm doing something there needed by my
how is this called, how do you call what we're doing here, a
it's a study for the university.
a study for the university.
and we need to talk for thirty minutes.
we're almost finished right now.
OK.
ah, it's getting tell him.
the, symptoms have already started.
tell him that when he goes to buy the motorcycle.



finished.




the half, nine.

but my friend bought a BMW and I bought him a because I have another friend at work that he is like, oh man he is crazy.
yes.







how old is he, fifty?
he is forty-something and he's almost at that difficult age.






yes.



yes.














no, and.








it's not worth being on the streets the way they are nowadays.
where they want to rob you.
no.
they assault you, they kill you for anything.
exactly, they assault you.
look, did you see there how they killed those people there in Chili's?
the in Chili's, yes.
yes.
but look, the people who live here in Miami Lakes, they get very upset because of that, because they say that Chili's was in Miami Lakes.

Fifty-seventh isn't Miami Lakes, you get it?


















Carol City right?
Carol City, but.




like Miami, like we were.


you know.
but when they refer.
just like after that palm tree?


the Burger Kings and McDonalds, all that over there is.
no.



either.

if you are going to call that anything, that's the Palms Springs North area.

that's what they're calling it, it's not Palms Springs North because Palms Springs North begins in the Seventy-ninth which is the and beyond.
so that's a little pocket there.
that.
that.
and so that's why they're calling it Miami Lakes.
they're calling it Miami Lakes because it's the town or city nearest to where it is, they're calling it Miami Lakes.
you know?
but notice one thing.
us being Miami Lakes and being incorporated, you put
three three zero one four and you'll appear in Hialeah.
you appear in Hialeah.


we are getting our own zip code, three three zero four.
three three one zero one four.
no, because three three one four takes in half of Hialeah then.
yes, but apparently a change is on its way so that three three zero one four is going to be Miami Lakes.
and when?
I don't know.
but they said that




yes.
yes, but notice, that's not something that the town of Miami Lakes has to do.
that's something that the federal government in guise of the postal department has to do.

they're the ones who have to make those changes.
and apparently they're in the process of making that change.
of changing the post, so that three three zero one four is going to be only Miami Lakes, the whole of Miami Lakes, what's inside the town of Miami Lakes, which includes the side over there towards the Royal Oaks subway, now it's Miami Lakes.


and that now is not three three zero one four, that's three three one zero five, one fifteen.
right.
it's a different zip code.
so they're going to change that zip code too to three three zero one four, because it's going to be Miami, what's inside the city of Miami Lakes.
is that?
that was what I heard and what they said.
if they do it or not.
but it's going to be a real hassle for people.
yes.
but anyway.
today I got the payrolls for the W1040.
you know it's the 1040.
the one that the elderly who are retired have to do now.
oh yes.
for them to know.
yes.
so that they can then send them the three hundred dollars.
so that they give them the five hundred pesos, right.
yes, are they the 10-40 or 10-99?

I have one there at home.

yeah, my father did one for my brother.
you've already done one for him?
yes because usually they don't do income taxes because they are retired.
because he has to.
right, but at the top you have to put a name.

yes.
you have to put something at the top of the form so that they know it's for that.
exactly.
has he already put that, has he already done that?
mmhm she is doing it for him, that's her field.

she's an accountant.
and she's the person who does it.
no, because I told you, because, like, Manuel's cousin works for the IRS.
she sent us the forms and she sent us copies for how to fill them in.
because I have my two old ladies, and really they can't do it.
if you could please make me, when you have the chance, make me a copy.
of how to fill it in.
I have it there, she gave me a copy and now I have to do it for her, but I'll make a copy for you.
that one, exactly.

I'll do it for you tomorrow at work.
because I know that does it.
but I know that there's something that has to be put at the top of the form.
that he's retired or something like that.
it has a name, I've forgotten it now, but you have to put that at the top, so that, because if not
yes.
it's the same as when you send the cheques to IRS.

you have to fill in the 10-99 with the social security number and all that stuff.
if not, they don't accept it, no, it's not that they don't accept it, if not, they don't authorize the they have to authorize it.
where they have to authorize it.

I think that there's still a bit to go to finish the thirty minutes, right?
well, I don't know, we've been talking for a while.
I don't know, it's almost half an hour already.

and it's getting dark already and we have to go to work tomorrow.
mmhm yes.
we have to cook.
no, I've already cooked.
you cooked already, we ate out, we went to the Bass Pro shop.


oh, ok.
there in Grifeny ninety five.
that one that's like a hunting lodge and all that stuff.
yes, I've been there.
and when we left we went to county to see the walls, the campers.

because we're looking for a bigger one for the future.
and from there we left.
and we took ourselves off to a barbecue place that there is at University and Pince Boulevard.


there they bring you just a tiny helping.
but they cook so wonderfully.







and we were there and Pepita asked and we asked her what she wanted for dinner.






and she told me, no, no, I'm hungry, I'm gonna eat now.

so today Pepa didn't have to cook.








yes.


Pepita wasn't there?
they're still finishing now on those days.
now Jennie has started there.
she already started at the spring break.

yes, I don't know what day Pepita begins but FIU is.
look, I, I found that Saint Thomas started too early.

you know.














you know, different places.



what happens is that, the Keys.

for college kids it's impossible.
but let me tell you Miami Beach is getting to be the same way.



yeah, but.






but everything else, it's cheaper at the beach than in the Keys.





so if they have to go to regular restaurants, it's expensive.
you know, some of those small restaurants in the Keys, they're nothing special, but they charge you more than a Burger King or a McDonalds, so for kids it's not really very practical.


I'm looking at my watch.
I think we have talked enough.
that little machine is great, with that tiny little recorder.
recording people when they do something for you.
yes.

the other day Office Depot put some little cards on sale.
those ones with one gig, two gigs.
I went and bought one for my camera.
but I use the regular ST.
Pepita in her camera uses one called dualpro or something like that.

that one was never on sale before, but finally Office Depot put it on sale.
and that day they had one of those little things on sale too.
a Sandisk that is an MP3 player with a recorder and a little FM radio all in one little package.
it looked good.
but when I arrived they didn't have any except the display one.
they didn't have any there.
but look, before you used to go to the classes in the university.





well.



you know, it opens the door for a lawsuit if something happens.

they have the teacher recorded, a teacher who says something, he makes a foolish remark in class unintentionally or intentionally, you know, they have it recorded.

but this country has gotten.
everything's a lawsuit, everything's a lawsuit.
everything's a problem, everything.
just like the lady that crashed into Myriam, because she was the one who crashed into her, you know.




mmhm, she was the one who got hit from the side.
no, they hit her at the windscreen, at the door, and smashed her door.

the axle on the front wheel broke because of that, I'm telling you, that women gave her such a big blow.
incredible, incredible.

mmhm, heavy.




but SUV-style or

a small car.




imagine.
it would have killed her.
imagine.
because I didn't have airbags in the PT Cruiser.
no.
PT Cruisers don't come with an airbag?

get the kid a good car, when we ended up finding out, when we had already paid everything for the car, that car had been completely crushed from the front.
in fact, it still had the sticker.

but it appears that it wasn't in the system yet, because it had just happened.


and they sold it to us thinking that the car had nothing.









like a rebuilt.



yeah, you know.
they didn't even want it.






yes.

yes.
















so yes, the thing about Chili's is terrible, isn't it?
that shooting there at Chili's.

and the other day the shooting in the school.

and yesterday and the day before, the riot in the Edison.

in the other.
the street is hot.
and where was the other place too here where there was a shooting too?
the other day, really near us here.
no, I, but wasn't it four forty-one there, in four forty-one, I think it was a little more in that direction.
no, but it was at Chili's.
at Chili's they had robbed and shot somebody a few days earlier.
and now there was a shooting again.
but there was another place again where there had been a robbery, a shooting.
the street is, it's really frightening.
indeed.

people are desperate.
yes.
people were desperate to try to solve it at any cost.

those young kids had spent all day, there fishing.
and buying.
oh, at least they do.





but it's already getting dark and they're already leaving.






I mean, we've been moved in here for almost sixteen, I believe that, like, fifteen or sixteen years, and they haven't done anything.


but then when you come from, like, the thirteen feet.
that strip there, the channel.






when the elections were on here in Miami Lakes, when the first race took place

one of the commissioners that ran.

one of those young guys came here.
and I told him, listen, look this is a good thing for you to look at to do.





tell him to come over here.
tell him to come over here.
no, let us finish talking, we still have five more minutes and they are recording us, bye.
we have, we use this as a guinea pig.

what was I telling you?
oh, about the young guy that came here.
oh yes, the one that was running here do you see that.
I tell him, that rubbish is not our rubbish.
that rubbish is when the County or the Water Management District comes and cleans their part.
they come with their shovels.

and they take all the rubbish.
then they walk three miles down there with their shovels, breaking up all the grass.
and then they throw a rubbish-bin onto the truck.
but do you know how many rubbish-bins get broken there that they leave lying around.
that's what you're seeing there.
he says, no, now we're going to look at that and other things.
they've never done anything.
every time the County goes past there with the.
and it comes past?
yes, yes, they go past.
how often?
they come by two or three times a year.

yes.
a machine that, they're what they put there in Red Road.
haven't you noticed there in the corner of the airport?
yes, I did.
one, in a place they put it.
there, yes, I see.
that's good.

those ones come here.
no, honestly, I've never noticed it before.
they're walking past walking.
but what's going on?
they clean up, they put down the shovel, and they go walking and breaking up that grass.
but instead of doing a small part of it.
and taking it to the truck, no.
imagine if the truck is stopped four blocks away.
do you believe they are going to take just a little, and take it there and bring it back?
they put down the shovel and go breaking it up and pushing in that direction.
but what happens afterwards.
everything gets left there loose, and it goes everywhere.
and when the wind blows from that direction or this.
all this dead grass,.
goes and falls in this direction.

and I throw away those things.
and I spray and that, to keep the grass so at least it doesn't grow too much but even with all that.
you find that the lily pads grow.
and the rubbish goes in there.
and, well.
you throw it away today and in two or three months they're already flowering and growing again.

and the lady next door now has a son, a grandson, doesn't she.
a grandson.

oh, yes.
yes, the grandson is living with her.
how nice that she's not alone.
you know that I thought that Lucía's sons, the daughters of the sons were living outside Miami.
but this one lives in Core Gables.

her son, her son is actually the father of the grandson that lives in Core Gables.
because, like, I never saw them round here or anything.

I'm gonna go live with my grandma, because they always talk like that
it's possible.
it's possible, don't you remember how, like, two or three years ago when he first moved there he got a car that he crashed.

Lucía hid him there for a long time.

they hid him, his car had crashed.
and it appears that the father was mad with them, and didn't fix it or anything.
and he was staying there at Lucía's house all that time.
until they sorted it out in one way or another.

do you see how nice the weather is this afternoon?

it's gone down now, it's, now it must be about seventy degrees.
it's really lovely.
we're still being tortured.
yes, these last four minutes are.
no, and me being pregnant, and pregnancy is really annoying.
and the classes are in Spanish?
oh yes, writing is in Spanish, but the books are in English.
so you can see me there.
and then I have to get myself
and then I have a dictionary
because I forget.
forget it.
it's a long time.
and, and you forget.
you're used to reading in English and writing in English.
yes.
then you have to write in Spanish.

we have to.
I've left it and left it.
and I have to do two assignments for the 4th, and I have an exam on the 4th.

I've left it for so long that I haven't finished.
yes.
you know, I'm going to get a copy for you.
I have an English-Spanish dictionary.
it's a CD that goes in the computer.
you've never used that.
no, no.
wait, I'm going to look for it for you.
what I have is the one that.
the English-Spanish regular.
yes the, that one that my mum left me.
my parents always had it and I inherited it.
and I have it there.
I'm going to get you a copy of this, because this is in the computer.
and you have it on the desktop.
click like this.
put the word in English or Spanish.
and it gives you the translation.
and it gives you uses and things of different things of the.
for everything that has to do with psychology you can't start without a master's.
in all the schools, all the counsellors.
and she hasn't got a master's yet?

OK.
but in all the schools if you want to become a school counsellor you have to have a master's in psychology, in behavioural education or one of these things like that.
and she's not going to get it?












so it's all technology.
ah no, if now everything is

so I can follow that path for another two years.
and get the doctorate.
doctorate.

that's good.


oh, but you can do it.
you are smart.
forget about that, that is




Jack, and so have they already started looking for furniture, or not yet?





and put all the furniture.
ah, they have got it there already?
yeah, the whole thing is sorted already.
ah, I thought that now they would go and start to buy them.












and everybody coming in.
and they have already put everything in its place?
and positioned.
more or less.
yes.












he spends all his time there cutting and cutting.





forget about it, he's doing the closet for peanuts.





and who is he?
a fried of your mum's?
no, he's a contractor.






but it looks good?
but



but the tile guy, you know, had to lay the tile like amrble.
what happens.
what happens, Jack, is that everything gets delayed.


they told you a week.


ah, good.
they brought like nine people with the machines, with the bags of cement, with everything.
and right there, with some guys doing the marking and some doing the cutting.









and the view they have is either the street or the bay.
we have the two sides.
we have the sea.
the sea.
to the front.
which is the main view where the doors are.
then her room faces towards the airport.
at the side looking west.
yes.

it's good.

imagine.













yes.
I know where that is.
then it's all pretty.





how come?
you have two rooms.






okay, but.



Jack, but you know.
to start with.





but


if we continue with the second one?
forget it.
we're screwed.
over there another one is coming up.
good thing that
no, no.
well, a bunk bed.
I think that as we're preparing it we can rent it out for two thousand five hundred.
and maybe charge the rest so that the would be a little more and


yes, dear, yes.

the market is tough really.
always, another option always appears that you can take.
yes.
no, now the environment isn't one for selling or buying or
because what happens is that if you buy
but afterwards when everything comes that one can think of.
the madness from before.
it is that here they have gone mad, Jack.
mad.
then the banks gave loans to people who didn't qualify.
there was no reason
to everyone.
because they didn't earn enough to pay that
you know and now it means that everybody is



who's standing outside.

to see who's standing outside.

Exactly.
that's exactly what's happening.
imagine the people with the houses, your aunt Ramírez says that for

yes, yes, I've got more over there.
that in her neighbourhood she says there are plenty of houses on foreclosure.
the thing is awful.



and look

she was lucky, Jack, because imagine


no, and then your uncle found himself without a job.
and listen






no, they can't, they can't sleep.
no.
I'll tell you that this situation is very bad.
because of that, you know, one has to try and spend as little as possible.
the people don't take responsibility of the foreclosures.
a huge amount of property taxes gets lost.
but of course.
they are not going to pay it.
of course, who will pay it when they are losing their house.
who will pay it.
and all the services will find themselves short of everything.
the banks are staying, imagine.


they should start lowering the wages for all those people who earn too much money.

ah, okay then.

well, but you know.
all those people they have there in management, almost all the people of the county, they all earn two hundred thousand pesos a year.
you know?
now that is money that




you can't.
and listen, a house now is five hundred thousand dollars.

but decent houses or starter house.
the guy next door has put the house up for sale.
but

you know what?

seven hundred thousand dollars.
who will pay that?
seven hundred or eight hundred they are asking for the house I think.
what is the situation like now?
I don't think so, Jack, that




thank God that we have bought this house.

because

yes.
look, no, sometimes.
listen, you have won the game.
this is the.
listen.

forget it.




and what we need to pay here is another five years.
if it's God's will of course.
when we retire it will already have been paid.
because if not, imagine.


no, Jack, this is
you see the people over there who retire.
and then they have to carry on working because the money isn't enough.

those poor old people are in serious trouble with money.
I don't know.
I don't know.

it's something that you do when you're a little crazy
that is that someone goes mad, you see.
but okay.
and how is Carla, Jack?

is she behaving?










how beautiful.
but listen to me.

and what?


come here and who will pay for the flat?
me.


and is the business doing well?






















no, now all of them are





not everything.
and you know, and with this eveything is a chain because if Homedepot isn't selling because nobody has sales, nobody improves houses, nobody

because when you buy a house you want to make this new, that new and so on.
and then that's how the money disappears.
but if nobody is doing anything





the gardens, the people who do gardens also say that
you know.
suffering.
that there is no
that's where they're cutting back.
there they cut.
so you know all those things now.
and now you go to the newspaper and those things already
and you see that they are talking about how you cut cost, how you're gonna reduce your monthly expenditures, where can you save 300 dollars a month.


of course.
little things here, here.
and everybody is doing it.
you even stretch out the cleaning.





you go the the grocery, fucking hell
fucking hell, three hundred.
I don't get out of there without having spent three hundred.
just imagine that I always used to do it here at the weekends
you know, always did meals.
and they came to eat and so on.
I don't do that any more.
there was a tremendous article in the newspaper today.
I do it once but it's not possible.

but it's not possible.








listen, the people that are General Mills that do the oat and the wheats they make all the cereals.





the milk.

five pesos.



they sting you.
yes.
they get you wherever they want to.
no, but you know that we complain here, Jack.
and it's true that things are tough.
but we have the opportunity.
but
if you want it, it's there.
yes, but let me tell you in Europe people are paying very much for petrol.
more than here.
oh, much more, almost double, more than double with all the taxes that they have to pay.
much more.
much more than here.
but in Europe they are doing as interesting things as here for all the complications of the politics of the shit system that we have, that it's better that it exists but shit.
if you look at Germany
Germany has a programme where people are paid so they can produce energy.
and feed the energy into the energy system of the city or the county as it may be.
so people are buying now.
and putting everywhere on their houses.
to save on
and all day long you're going to be producing.

and feeding it into the system.

of course.



yes.

but people in Germany know that they passed the law that's good for twenty years that every like kilowatt that you put back is twenty cents or twenty five cents or something fixed.

like you say about where the grandparents live.
and there was one for the farm.
aha.
do you remember?
with the farm.
the fields of paint.
aha.





if it is

it is subsidising it so that


yes.
and then a dependence on oil that is incredible.
and the sun doesn't run out.
today there's more than enough sun.
and the more time passes the better technology will become.
and the more energy you will be able to collect.
so let's say today you can collect so much energy per hour on a square inch.
that will continue to rise.
and on the same space.
you will be able to collect double, ten times, a hundred times.
they have to do something about it because, you know, er












yes, of course.





yes, yes, with the technology that is there now, mate.

this is incredible.
but it's all based on technology.
how incredible, isn't it?
the things that can be done.
that.
those things, the telephone that you have.
they have everything inside there.
everything, everything, it has everything.
so that they almost think for you, they do the thinking for you so you don't have to do anything.

look at my telephone, I have my whole calendar and the people at my office have access to it.
and everybody can put things in my calendar, when there is an appointment, a meeting, whatever it is.
I have the telephone synchronised with the computer in the office, with the servers so I can access any computer through the web, all my contacts, all my contacts.










but it captures it on the computer.








that's great.













or you had a little black book or the thing where you used to move it for the letter, and.
it's showed everything.
it showed.
do you remember?

the number, the telephone.
everything.






yes, that was when they were.
do you remember?
when we were in the







Jack, but the thing is that they have bought me one of those phones and I don't know what I'm going to do with it.







the telephone does it all.
I'm lost.




you imagine that you look at a little telephone like this.
and you don't see anything.
it is so small.



then when you look at the web page you take your fingers.
and if you watch it, like this, it zooms you in.



and if you touch like the link like on the internet, if you touch the hyperlink, it takes you.
but it's all with your finger.












you take the telephone from there when you have been listening to music.
you put it on its side.
and it changes.
it knows that you have put it on its side.
there it opens all the albums.
and all the covers of all the albums.
and you hold it like this.
and it will show you all the pages one after the other, all the albums.
you touch the cover of the album that you want.
and you do it the other way round.
and you see the list of all the songs.

you touch the song.
and it plays it for you.
I have to show it to you.

but because that's where everything is going like.

you know now.
do you use Google?
yes.
you go to Google.
type a word.
and I brings it to you.
now there is something that is in what is called beta.
better.
beta is like a testing
that has gone out to the public.
I think there are still 900 opportunities for beta testers.
it's called "Searchme.com".
which is comparable to Google.
but it does something very different.
when you put the words.
and you do a search.
instead of delivering it to you in a list of words
it gives it to you in previews of the website.


and it takes you to the next website.
the next arrow, boom, to the next website.
the next arrow, boom, to the next website.


of course.



and all the words open for you at the bottom.


but they are testing that now.
















wasn't that the one that Microsoft tried to buy?


yes.





fucking hell.


I know.
I know.

yes, because before it was only Microsoft internet.








it's good.

but well.
no, no, and
the cost of the processing capacity is still going down.
so today you buy a computer.
you remember the computer that we had in the little room in the old house?
you know what?
aha.
today you are talking of a computer that has a thousand times that capacity.
the capacity and the







come here, how much does a laptop cost?
what for?
for my dad?
for your dad's birthday.

your dad's birthday is next week.

it's that
no, for buying.
I'm buying it for him.
but more or less, how much are they now, something like the
you think it's better to buy him a laptop?
I think it's better because spends time working on the one that used to be Olguita's.
but I have
but it doesn't charge the battery.
I have got a great connection to fix that.
so I have asked him about it.
I took mine to be fixed to the same place last week.
it's alright.
and they fixed it for me there and then.
why, was yours broken as well?
when we were at the camping Mary was moving the suitcase back in the cart to take the car away.
and the laptop fell from the suitcase onto the floor.
awful, it was banged up.
it was damaged?







do you think then that that can be fixed?




no, he doesn't have that much because here in the house is where he does most of the work on the computer.





he doesn't require putting in


yes, it's because he doesn't know, he doesn't know that I'm going to buy one, son.
because I, listen
I'm going mad trying to think.
and I don't know.

I'm tired of buying him shoes, clothes
he hasn't told you anything that would give you an idea of
no, no, I haven't talked to him.



we could go to the shop together.
and I'll show you different things.
but I'm trying to think
yes, but remember that it's next week.

it's the third.
and tomorrow is the thirty-first already.
so I think it's the Thursday.

I think, isn't it?
Wednesday or Thursday.
Thursday.


but he's just bought a camera.



yes.
you know those that go "tch-tch-tch".
and they have everything.


he has bought himself one that takes even videos.
you know.












yes, but that again isn't it because we have already bought one.
for the bedroom, was it?

no, for camping.
haven't you seen it?





one of the best ones that there are.

but that was for Valentine.



I don't know.
think, and let's see.
because, you know, I have seen him with the computer problem.
it always has the
I'd say, okay, let's go and see if I can buy him one.
if you say that that can be fixed because it's not really an old computer

that computer is great.

the only thing it has is that it doesn't charge the battery.
it seems to have a contact somewhere that doesn't
you know that it doesn't boot well.

that's typical.
that's typical.
is it?



and is your mum here now or is she on her travels?

















that's what you know, one

one moans about this here but, mate
listen, it's the best there is.


no, as it is it's not perfect, but
but I think one of the best, you see.


yes, sir.
and now the elections are coming up, Jack.






yes, because the Democrats say that they belong to the common people.
but they are the ones who raise taxes most, you see.




but why?
why should there be a welfare system to maintain people?
a welfare system is there to help you and direct you for a year or two.
to pick you up, you know.


give it.

go and find work.
why should I maintain you?


now the women give birth.
they have, every year they have a child.
they don't have a husband.
I don't know how they make the children.
and then?
the guy needs to maintain it.
while more children bring more money they'll have them.
they don't work.
and who is it?
the Democrats are responsible for that.
because I understand that one has to help one person.
no, and Barack is a tremendous Democrat.
that one is a tremendous piece of shit.
and his agenda is a very secret and hidden one, you see.
hidden.
hidden away.
he is a politician like any other.
you know what?
he doesn't stretch himself much because you know that he's well.
he is equal.
from the moment he started there has been a red light.
you know that those red chickens aren't any sweeter.
no.
when the cause doesn't suit him well.
no, forget about it.
that he'll put Hillary as vice-president.
now, nobody because nobody wants her.
she is even worse.
no-one kills him because it would be worse to be stuck with her.
that woman behaves like

that woman

she is worse than her husband.
















what is
how do you say?
politically correct.
look.
we shit on Somalia when he was president.
we came here.
later on in Kenya, I think that the Tutsis and the Hutus killed 800 thousand people in about forty days.
yes, that was
something like this.
yes.
it was like twenty thousand people a day

they were killing.
and the other one didn't do anything.
and everybody knew that it was happening.
and let it happen.
look, it was happening
amd those were saying:
look, if we do something the Republicans will crucify us.
he was very busy.
he was busy.
he is very busy.
what a guy.
what a sort of bloke, my god.
I don't know where we're going to end up, Jack.
and the other poor guy is very old.
the other one is
but he knows what he's doing, okay?



I'm going to vote for him.


















no.

they want to be on good terms with everybody.
with everybody.
and you can't.

like they say:
they were in Ohio.
where many people have lost their work because of NAFTA.
because that just happened to me manufacturing state.
but

he was very thrilled
he was happy, happy
he says they gave him that internship
the what?
the internship

he is like an intern
he doesn't get paid
but they let him be there in the studio
he says that, that he, you know, that he never has done anything like that
that he has to go inside and see if everything is clean, he has to see if there is anything missing, this, that, he has to call to check
they gave him a secretary
but he is in the studio where he wants to be
well at least he is going to do something he likes

I didn't know he was living with his mother
yes?
that is why he fought with his stepfather
well, yes, his stepfather is his same age
how is he not going to be fighting with his mother?
no
it is the space and the stress
the husband's stress or the son's?
the mother's!
but honey this is

they are two different relationships!
well, he is annoyed because the mother is not paying attention to him, it's not the same attention when she was alone as now when he
of course
that is why he is annoyed
ah, that is why
come here, dear, but, and this, I think it is going to continue
it is because of the light
it is bright










































put a hundred here and here and both are the same

seven and seven, fourteen
and then you add this back here and this back here

then do I put the whole amount?




what is this?
what number is this?



I don't understand those numbers you are doing











you put eight







you count this, here only, that's it
four
five, six, seven, eight, nine
seven, nine


that is difficult for you
try to find an easy way

ah, but you have to find a way



that big one doesn't do it
those three ones that are here do not make a big one
then you put a one here
count this four




round it off to how much, to nine?


no, it's better to round down, not up
relax











bless you




oh, I'm hungry

I need to eat something good today
like what?
if it is possible
yes
yes, yes it's possible
today with cash
if it isn't cash, no
ah, we are screwed
why?
so we need your job
to eat






I don't care where we eat, whether it's at the corner of the street, from one of those foodcarts
but something that
are you going to find something in the foodcart?
no, but I'm telling you
it doesn't have to be at a restaurant
you were the one that talked about a restaurant







what did you want to eat?
I want to eat a hot dog





oh no, even my stomach has got like this
I ate a hot dog today
from where?
like this long, yes
from where?
when, like this, from that foodcart that it is coming there
the foodcart has hot dogs?

yes?
yes, that foodcart has hot dogs
come here
and how is it that you ate a hot dog if I brought you lunch today?
no, but that was at ten o'clock in the morning
not at lunch time, no, no
and it wasn't a hot dog
what was it, a sausage?
it looked like a sausage, yes, but it was this long
it cost me one twenty five

listen, you know I have to tell the valet guy that the hot dogs from the foodcart are cheaper and safer
than the hot dog from Seven Eleven where they go to buy them
but for half of the hot dog is it one dollar?
and the bread is twenty five cents
and then you choose
so you the bread

and you take the spoons that are there
and you find the sauce that you like the best
of all the food they give you there?

or the sauce
and they charge you for that too?
for the sauce, no
yes
they do charge you for the hot dog
it means that I do not have to eat bread when I eat a hot dog?
no
that's fine
I do not like the bread when, hot dog
yes but it is
put it on a plate, that's it
in the that one it was only to eat the hot dog
and I ate it

so you take the sauces from, that are there
there's meat, there's everything, a variety of things
you
there's meat in the sauce?
yes, because the sauce is from the meat

the sauce that comes from the beef steaks, the sauce, the grease that comes with the beef steak
or from the other one
or if you don't take some beans, nothing
you know, between the sauce and the sauce a little piece of meat is also there
and then you pick up the thing
and you place it
and you close it
and you go to the guy and tell him
how much is it?
one twenty five

that, Pablito was telling me that she liked it
because you could put what
her plate, it cost two dollars fifty cents
no, no, no and you put everything you want
that is what she said also
she says no.
you take a saucepan there and
oh my God
then I have this amount
for example there is a
that is the amount to register for food and the rest
you see?
a hundred dollars are gone in food
what, what?
one hundred dollars where?
in the refrigerator
that refrigerator doesn't get filled with a hundred dollars
with less?
more
but it doesn't have to be full
it's not a requirement to fill it
OK, it's OK

but now start thinking
I don't fill it
OK, it's OK
have you seen the refrigerator now?
what's in it?
nothing
it doesn't have anything?
I think there are two eggs
we have to buy eggs then
now
we have to buy eggs!
but that it is what I am telling you that
we've been economising, you know, economising here and there
I told you it is going to last me two paychecks plus two, two paydays
they're going to be approximately here
this is the twenty-eighth, three twenty-eight
this month is the first rent that has to be paid
this, this is the one
and afterwards here
that is the first rent
that's where we are going to find out how we are financially
there it is
from this moment to the second twenty-eighth that's coming, probably like the thirteenth
let me see

if they pay me on the twenty-eighth then the next one here, look, it is going to be the eleventh
and I would like to be a little ahead
so seven and seven is fourteen, right?

so it's one thousand four hundred, which leaves me twenty eight as a credit
remember yesterday we were talking to see if we could
if I can, even if I avoid paying the rent a month ahead of time, then that way when the children come I can pay to take them to Disneyworld for a little bit
to Disneyworld for a little bit?
yes

no, but just for a day or two
for a day, no?
no, I have to stay overnight with them
imagine having to drive five hours
ah, you leave Friday and come back on Sunday
all of us leave on Friday
do you want to come?
yes, if there is nothing else to do
and we are going with the girl and then with the boy
I don't understand that
we are going to Disneyworld when the baby and later when the boy
yes because she does not come at the same time
ah, so we go, so we have to go two times










if I bring her or him the first week until August
I have June, July and August if I separate them
that is one week
and one week, it does not matter in what month, July or August, for the boy
I think the boy is going to want to stay more

















he wrote to him
who wrote to who?
a letter to the boy, Rupert
Rupert wrote a letter to the boy
and what does he say in the letter?
he sounds frustrated about, if you live in my house free, you're not doing these things, not cleaning his room, not doing this or that
then he tells me
mommy, I am not free here
I go to work
and the money that comes to this house
I make it
the boy knows
he says
I have to do more?
and I bring
and look how he tells me that, how it is that I live in this house free?
then he tells me
because you have a telephone
and then you spend it in
and he tells me
I pay my phone
the boy
then he tells me
mommy I try to be positive
and not pay attention to dad
but he says things that, you know, that frustrate me
he says
and I do not know what to say
and I tell him
don't tell anything to your dad
you are still a minor
now
no, no, no
even if he is of age, he cannot say anything to his dad
I know, I think he understands that part
but he is one of those that he feels like he is

















the boy is not going to want to talk to his dad
he is not going to want to know about his dad



no, Rupert never has wanted a lot like that either
I don't think so
so at what age did Rupert leave the house?
I don't know
Rupert left the house when he was thirteen
thirteen?
thirteen years old
ah no, then he is behind then
Paco has been working for his dad since he was thirteen
ah, I see
yes, that was one of the first excuses he used when he sent the boy to work

I tell him
no, no, no, leave the boy alone
he says
well I worked since I was thirteen
look how big the boy is
aha, exactly that is what the boy is going to do
ah, honey but that is what I do not want him to be
and I always tell him
it is not a question of what you want or don't want
if Rupert left home at thirteen
and the boy is sixteen
and he still is in the house
and on top of that he is doing the letters, those pronunciation ones



but it is normal
that is why we have our children, no?
to spoil them and when they grow up they go their own way
no, no, no, no
Paco is a really responsible kid

exactly, exactly


















at what age did I leave home
tell me
well, like twenty-something, so I was really old
and you
did you not work before that?
I went to school
yes to the school, no, the school is the school
the school does not have anything to do with this

after I finished school is when I started to work
I had a wife
and I would say that I was a man
I was still at home
and when I fought with my wife I would run to my house

when I came from working in the fields
twenty-four six
I would go to my wife's house
that is my wife's house
my home is my mother's house
my wife's house, living and everything there
yes, yes, I got here
look, here's some food
food, that is what you have inside
in Cuba it's food
in Cuba you take food
in Cuba there are no cars or shoes or clothes or anything
food, food, food, food, food
I am going to my house to take the rest of the food
you took food to your mom

since my mother doesn't like mess, then I would bring the animals alive
I see
and I would kill them there

and I would arrive at my house, you see, with clean meat
with the meat nice and clean for your mommy
of course
how cute

what are they doing today?







is to find out all the problems that that are happening because we can't get the um these the Excel sheet on one page






















there?

to have control

we, remember we want to give the test, not wait for them to give the test
let's see







and are they also going to save money by doing that?

do they earn money?

saving

at the moment they have to rent one



they're going to spend money


more money because now they're going to give a PHQ to everyone

you take the exam before you apply for it so you know what it's like.
before, before you appy you take an exam







but Mason, in a way it's better, because if you pass then you know what you're capable of.

it's good
but why not, how are you going to find out the person who applied and who didn't apply if they didn't pass the test, they're out of the picture?
but that's

they're it's the person who applied.
no it's not
ok so what we're going to do is that when they come to do the CJ Bat

you're going to have a log where they can write their name
and they ask you there if you've already applied on







but I don't know why they're doing it like that.
you shouldn't give them a PHQ because if this person doesn't pass the test then why give them a PHQ?



I don't get you
How is that possible?




that's what I told them
all this we didn't hear everything

yes




but you always start


you always start with the orientation right?
ah, listen and write down, that that was my idea
listen
what?
no, that was your idea, but I'm saying in principle, I myself was saying that.


and this idea that
remember.
which one?


they're accepting.
institutions



but if you have taken a CJ Bat test taken an F Bat I can't accept your score


but it's logical that if they pass that exam, the F Bat test, if they pass it, why not, and, and, and the state accepts that one.
FDLE accepts it.
I've gone back, then
no we can't accept it.
so he said that he came up with the idea.
I asked him that question and now he's saying he came up with it himself.
well I really think that they should have the orientation first and then the exam.
me too. definitely.
definitely definitely.
then in the orientation you can decide if the person is a good candidate or not.
and when this person says

they are going to find out about the drugs that I used or



and they won't do anything more.

exactly
they're already going to give them the PHQ so that they can start the PHQ.

so take the exam afterwards in the afternoon
but Mason but you have to say that to him.


that doesn't make sense


I was I don't agree with that.

you're going to waste paper.
for fun




I know
but this is what I said to him in my office I said

I don't agree with that.

I don't think that you should give anyone a PHQ unless they apply.
because I have a piece of paper I send you a piece of paper to your house what are you going to do with it?
give it to the kids so that they can use it because if you're not interested why should I give you one?








that's what I'm saying
it doesn't make sense
the thing is that I want to be.


all they have is a number
and to get the number well
um that doesn't make sense.

definitely it doesn't make sense



because I've explained to him twenty thousand times
and he doesn't want to know the that goes on there.
what goes past him is.
and look look look at what
why do they want applicants?
they're going to have the academy until April and until December
there's going to be a
there's going to be a
Exactly
and how many people are going to get the academy?
is forty the usual?
forty




for December



listen, things are bad








listen, speaking of, remember what I said, that I was talking about Carle, talking about and opening the date?

that's what I said
that's what I've always told him

we're going to
he says no and no and no

so now it makes sense because I told him



and he said
no no no I don't want to do that.
he doesn't want to do that
I'm the lieutenant
but on day 1 I said it to him
even David recommended it to him
he recommended that he close the position.

well and why don't they do it now?


after I said to you

every month they're going to instead of having three thousand people.I'm going to have at least um










but I'm glad that he accepted it
because I was behind the





and you don't see, like, a change or that it's coming like that from far away.
a change?
didn't you hear what he said?
you don't see how something's going to change?
well
I'm going to say to you that
ay I just don't know
what type of change?
for now when you were with I told him that it means a promotion











you don't know what they're going to do.
they're not going to do anything
look
for one thing
I've been here for ten years
and in those ten years they promised him that they were going to take away the people, the personal technician, all the technician, they were going to payroll to work, to learn the work.
they did it
they do crosstraining
they never did it
they never did the crosstraining
yes but think that they still haven't put the assistant there for you, to work

there's no money
they gave me four, four sergeants there, how much is that costing us?
our budget is down.
those four sergeants were leaving with a hundred thousand dollars
oh no
it's way more than that

I would say
just for them
you can't believe it
four or five?
four
four
because

there
more people not more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
no
they're only doing recruitment


they go to university in the city and all that
minimum fifty thousand a person

really?


they take





they supposedly go to the university




we we don't see a list


oh that's what I'm saying, that here they do whatever suits them, they see what they want to see and nothing more
because right now there's no reason to have five four of these sergeants in our department
sitting there
sitting there no more

yes
casually
look
and what's more, I think these people aren't that qualified
yesterday we had a group, I don't know if the Germans went to a training bureau
so they came to us yesterday, there were about twenty people there.
you believe me that no one is an official. Not Maria not the other new woman not even the dark haired woman
no one
they knew what to do so that they could attend that, give an introduction
I had to get involved to tell them more or less what they would do in this departmenthow they would process the applicants what they could hope to expect from the academy




wow how interesting



there were some Spanish people who came

yes

but imagine it
then the um the dark haired woman started to talk there
one of the Germans asked her if she had to to be able to police.


she didn't understand the question.

she told him



ay it tastes good


amazing dish, big
here
listen this tastes delicious
you're going to eat all that?
you can have all that?
that's Lana for you
it seems that Lana I don't know what this thing is

it's wrapped in a blanket
this could feed five people Lana
yes

what's on the outside?
a taco
it's a huge wrapped tortilla
but is it a taco?
an enormous tamal
the truth is that I don't know what it is

ah you had that lunch that diner the other day
bon appetit
thank you
I hope we're not going to leave here smelling of food

and you know this is boiling













to take a thing from
and which do you think that the most of

the best system well
it's very slow
the first one that didn't work properly

it takes a long time for an applicant to be able to finish an application, and they feel like I did something you know
















the programmer did it




and what happens next is that instead of him applying it, this liutenant took it upon himself.







another
with more more and even more of the information
true



I told him
lieutenant, you didn't give that poor guy a chance to speak
what did he say?
he's not going to talk to you
he says
ay it's true that it was noticeable.
he said






if he they come to me to tell me whatever
the liutenant says


but he takes advice at every meeting
he was going
I mean they're never going to know





no but





yes because remember that the country the country um employs and there's a position for a secretary right.
it doesn't have to be tracking things

my food is spicy

wait, I a chilli



jalapeno right?














no the assessment














































take this chilli as well

it's pretty spicy

it burns
but it's this big
and I ate the whole thing
yeah ok but

afterwards it gave me the hiccups
my eyes looked like
s. too intense
ask you need to ask that question about to mom one time she made crabs remember
ah salmorejo sauce
knew which crabs there in Visque
what's that?

crab
crab


you left Cuba without knowing the word for crab?

you don't know it


well crab whatever
say "crab", then I know what you're talking about
we used to catch a lot





one more
anyhow and so I caught a heap
and she was preparing them
and I don't know what some computer was doing
she says to me
take one
try it Mason
and she gave me one
to try
girl, she emptied the salt bottle
and when I put it in my mouth my eyes were doing this
there was a lot of salt
look she emptied the bottle of salt into a crab
ah I was
look it made my eyes roll back into my head
you make the salmorejo sauce with salt pepper and crushed garlic and a bit of oil
a bit only a bit
and you mix it with the crab meat
and you put it with the shell all mixed up
you take the parboiled bananas
and you eat it with banana
what a weird mix
but I think she put in too much
Imagine
girl
she definitely wanted to kill you all
after, then they say that and they want some more, no way
it almost kills you
almost
but it's something I'll try one day. It's something different
not many people know what the dish is




but you have to take out the and everything
but for the biggest part of the crab we take out the.


look I've been laughing so hard
it's been a lot of fun being in the car with the lieutenant
because I didn't know that that sergeant, it was a new experience for him
he noticed
always with a
exactly
and so the weirdo has been administration
he has never done that
so he's like like like




but he doesn't know his way around downtown
so


he had
and the seargant giving instructions
over here over there double over here
go over there
for all I know
him just doing anything that the lieutenant said
I'm telling you, I think that he doesn't have the option of not paying attention to what he's saying
but you heard what he said. that I don't know if it's because of his rank that I'm doing everything he says?
why?

so then afterwards he has to park
and so we start getting annoyed
he says
I'm already getting nervous
I won't be able to park
he left the car three feet from the curb
walk
it was there. three feet away.
yes yes
she was going to invite us to lunch
but we already knew that we were going to do this today
she's gone with him in the end
after being, she started saying
that the graphic that he did supposedly for the lieutenant
he asks
is it good enough like this or something more like this?
like he had him on the floor
but it's that I what the lieutenant was saying
and I know that you're thinking
I read that the lieutenant really had made a graph of that forhim.


you know we say he did it with crayons

so these little figures here
I was saying to him
this one that took the plates from the bathroom the men's bathroom they scan it and put it in there

Sergeant the things you took are the happy faces to actually put there
and I wanted to compliment you for it
and I did it more
and what I did was ruin it
and so I said to him







and when he arrived he said to me
look how lost I am here
I have no idea what's gong on
and he said to me
so he doesn't have a background in administration, right

he's learning
everyday he's learning a bit more eh
but he's used to being on the street
yeah so I really said to him
he's one who's used to the people
the people
punch people
imagine it

so
so I say to him
and the sergeant

that you come from the street
I say to him
but where do you come from?
because I'm starting to realise that you're not familiar with anywhere around here
around here
he was pretty much lost
yes
Oh my God so he says
it's not that they had me
Oh my God

you can tell he's a good person
that he likes it?
someone's phone


yep
does he like the office?
it's my phone



does he like the office?
it's not like I ever have my phone on?
now you can say the first month
ay I forgot to turn it off last night
the first month he says that I don't know

oh no
the bill
well yeah yeah
do you want to bring the bill or not?
yes, you do, don't you?
yeah
you've already done quality work for today
no, I haven't finished
I haven't finished yet
because she talks a lot
and the other sergeant. what's his role?


he works more in the background. like an investigator. approving the files

do you want the tortilla?
and where does he sit to do all this?
next to the sergeant.
look at mine.

at Smith's side

the other one is more serious
but you know that he's a humble person
no the other one is a little like that
really?
is that right?
what you want
I haven't spoken to him yet
yes
yes the small one
the lieutenant says
so I say to the sergeant
look you're doing a wonderful job
I'm not really sure what you're doing
but I've noticed that you're doing whatever you're doing beautifully
and the lieutenant says
listen I think that you're inviting the sergeant to lunch
so then he says something about if you look good or something I don't know what
don't worry you look good so

don't kiss no butt no more
listen, but that car makes a noise.
that car makes a lot of noise.

no, man, like, really.




put it here

I had never been, obviously, in a police car
it made a lot of noise.
but a patrol car?
that car made a lot of noise.

a patrol car or a van



yes
we have too much here. there's eighty dollars
wait a sec
what did you have?
what did you eat?
I had the same as her

and
divide it between

he's calculating





everything.


where is Paco?
Paco Picapiedra

Néstor the man
ah Néstor really is Néstor Néstor
















listen they made me clean the house yesterday because
I was I arrived at home
I cleaned all the furniture and everything you know even the bath the shower well everything the glass so it was spic and span
and so when they went
they called me






so look

I had fun yesterday
because yesterday there was an association meeting there where I live
and I said
well I'm going to take the opportunity to make some flyers, since I'm renting my apartment
and I'm gonna pass out flyers

so I wait outside at the end of the meeting
and I'm waiting for everyone
and talking to everyone about I don't know what
and this handsome boy comes in
I say to him
look love
I'm going to give you this
because I'm renting my apartment and if you're interested just call me
and this old man who was talking to me says
hey, but don't think I know this woman
it's just the apartment
I say
no but don't say that to her
let them call me if they want to call me too
too much information
Oh my God I laughed at that
this
I'm so full
well imagine

I'm full but not exploding


yes

the only problem now is that I'm going to be fishing tomorrow
really?








nah I'm one of those guys who stays at night
but you don't go there alone right?

I take the dog
the whole time
it's nothing more than screwing me all the time
in the morning over there every time that I said something he would say something to me
the best thing about her is that she doesn't complain you know
I take a person with me




and I don't
listen
that girl that I didn't know I've got her confused with Tina because I thought that she was Mexican
she seemed Mexican when
well when I met her I thought that she was Mexican
she has a great personality

until you push the wrong button
why?

does she have a temper?
oh, yes
really?
she's feisty?
she's feisty
Linda López the testing

she's really cool
but she gets on well with me because she knows
what happens is that I
she knows
I am the one
yes
yes
what happens with me is that I have to push her so that she gives me the answers I'm expecting.
so that you see
and she says to me


you see
I'm just saying

and she starts to say to you

yeah but she's cool


the lieutenant and her have had you know conflicts
really?

over over there in the
what's it called?
so Tina is the computer person?





Tina is the, the, the tall skinny one

so she's Linda's boss?
yep

ah, if you don't know the song they have it in.

a CD.
it's cute.
bring it.
which one is yours?
mine is the Centro Gallego, yours the the Capitol and the.
yes because sometimes the only thing that is good in having economic problems when nothing is built is that the city is saved.
ah what a nerve!
me in the black box i thing I threw it away.

it's so nice!
it has the handles from the people in the square.

she told me.
I already know.
I'm gonna give every kid a present.
and I said that now he would be inventing.
se told me because.

and I don't have bag.
I would have thrown it away.
the Centro Gallego.
she made a comment that she had it.
we can move the toys of my children.
I don't know
in Freedom Tower they have an exhibition, not an exhibition, like an event to the Freedom Tower, the tower where all the Cubans came.
and if you go to.
I think I sent you a link.
no!
or I sended it to me because it was an article from Miami Herald.
that you can, people can record their experiences passing by the Freedom Tower that whatever.
because now the Freedom Towe was given to Miami Day College.
and then they are organizing activities, events and that, of poeple, that they were given coffee, Coke.
not even.
then they were given spam.
I know several people.
yes.
daddy

Jesusito says that when you were first here you used to go to Freedom Tower to get things.

what a imaginative man!
what a liar.
ok go.
and ask him because he said never.
and record him.
my Jesusito invents a lot.
yes yes yes yes he should write, be a fiction author because he says it with so much conviction.
yes.
he can't, I say he can't resist.
ah yeah the flags? we should put it a little bit more
ah the.
yes.
no no no I can't resist because they were too cute.

is there anybody all?
it has a little bit weird legs.
it is that it's like.




is seems kind of stupid because the little one is not going to know who gets what.

anyway they can stand on their own.


it was too cute to make?.
the little flags called my attention.
tell me!
but he just denied it!
and, he just denied it.
and who was going to.

and then Santa Claus brought to the two of her.
and then she said to the son that as she knew that Santa Claus was going to bring her that.
bot one was for her.
but she liked the big blonde mine.
so I think I'm going to have to order one so she have the little one, because she is going to want the little one.

a third of the company.
he doesn't need to argue with anybody.
eh the company was transforming into more or less a plumbing contractor.
and he is not interested in that.
you know he wants to design a bit.
he doesn't mind building.
but with a little bit more of

you looked at me with crazy face when I brought the crackers.
I think everybody woke up already.
Jack woke up at nine, Patrisha at eight and Thomas at half past eight.

because I still have the little light.
the poor one that has to translate, the girl, how is she called, Catalina, is going to say.
oh my god.
too many people talking at the same time.
Galician Spanish.
well and i took time to understand Beni.
she told me "pacha" or something like that, "pacha".
was it "pacha"?
yes I say.

something similar to "pacha" the feeding bottle.
it has the "pacha" when it is half.
it had the "pacha" at three in the afternoon.
and I said.
ah the feeding bottle!
similar to "pacha", it wasn't "pacha" but it was something like that that doesn't
god knows what it was.
the first four times I said.
what is she telling me?
it's recording.
be careful with what you say.
I know.
the Sprite.
yes.
ah, get a fill-up.
no.
fill up the car.
no.
but Ana is not the car.
we are going to fuel up you car maybe.
but we're going to fuel you up!
it is worse that I fax, you fax, you fax isn't it?
I didn't know that.
you know more than me.
daddy? says that he he had fun.
they were a lot of time.

well maybe he pretends to know nothing.
and he knows more than.
no when, wasn't he a merchant marine?
according to Alba this is.
yesterday she didn't throw you to the cemetery because she was included.
that they were all ruined.
them, he was very handsome.
everybody was, what it was is, I'm defending him.
Ana says.
don't protect him!
right?
by the wat talking about sweets eh rompope, have for diet, in the outer refrigerator.
ah you aleady discover it!
what?
how awful!
I know.
I know.
I understood what it was.
but it's still a sacrilege.
I didn't like it very much.
how intelligent they are.
eighty forks.
and forty spoons.
so they give more forks because you need always more.
that is a box of the other plastics?.
what do you have love?
I have do you want me to bring you?
because I have a new box.
I don't want girl!
mine.
the without bottom.
yes for me too.

she that says.
they call it puch three.
she is from Trinidad.

I think she puts evaporated milk, condensed milk.
she doesn't put egg.
I think she told me not very good.
I have to make more?.
so they aren't, there are they left?.
very easy.
you spend the whole day milking the cow.
after.
I don't know how.
you put sugar the, the sugar.
you have to move but well.
yes is cream of.
the one that he's not going to try.
well so that you combine it with.
yes yes yes.
don't pay attention to him.
I need another bottle to make more, when a bottle of wine is empty.

listen I told himher.
but I have more.
two bottles.
I need two bottles.
after you didn't have a good word to say about him.
it's that one, hers.
she, she, I think
are you saying that you're going to the Amazonas?
and what are you going to do in Ecuador?
and why Ecuador?
I'm going to say that to my friend.
yes yes yes but a little hotter.
and shehe hit him.
these people from the south of Ecuador I don't know.
you don't know what you're speaking about.
and that crazy Cuban is able to hit.
so forget it.
the, so the
and how much time were you there?
I was about to die.
daddy used to go to the Freedom Tower to get the butter.
we believed you.
but you told the story being only seven in a way that wasn't accurate and daddy came back mad, as he had been insulted.

they love the spam.
not in the mountains, in the hill, in Hawaii, in Polynesia all of them are given to.
and I think that, to me, now you mention it in the Dominican Republic they like spam because when the Americans came with the spam and to them there's a delicatessen.
ah but the spam and the devil ham were the same.
don't throw away the bottle so we can make more.
the Miami Herald had the oter day an article about Encanto.
that they have an Encanto ex-employee association.
and it was burnt three days after the invasion of?
yes?
three, four days before the?

the Cuban version of Harrods.
then is there another bottle of wine?
it doesn't matter.
we're just missing another bottle of wine.
no.
I have it full of wine and of everything you want.
I think last year we did the same.
they were left out.
the white.
we have to put, we have to put.
did you put Oxiclean?
what is it that is dirty?
but did you left it with Oxiclean?
a while.
but did you leave it in the dryer?
because you would have leave it wet because it.
you won't be able to take it off.
no.
take it off.
when you dry.
if you leave it wet you can still try to take it off.
when you dry it in the dryer it already.
all the stains are left.
with me it was there.
I have a tablecloth that was yours that was put there.
they are going to tell him off.
the conversation is downwards.
it tis recording.
Catalina is going to say.
the day she met us she is going to say.
aha you are!
they have been asking themselves that for more than seventy years.
it's true.
it's true.
one house on the beach of Galapagos.
you have to write a book.
he is Jesusito, hit him!
hit him.
with a brother and husband like you who needs enemies!
but what it is going to be?
that he is going with the seals to the Galapagos island?
but what is he going to do in Ecuador?
he is going to count them one two.
but is he going to the Amazonas from Ecuador?
do you know a Bruno from Ecuador thar studied here more than twenty years ago?
Indian's?
was the Indian?
or was it Bolivia?
from Bolivia is the one from the Indian.
oh, true.
but wasn't it in?
well the one with mixed blood from Venezuela.
the one with mixed bloog from Venezuela was crazy.
this is the misfortune.
because they can't say.
no.
because that one took.
he was very quiet.
what is he doing now?

they don't not of.
yes, not, it's, there was an article in the Miami Herald that the sugar refineries in Cuba don't exist anymore.
yes because the sugar refineries in Cuba.
they don't want to get it out if sugar is produced.
yes well it would be forzen by the time they carry out an agreement.
the big ones are out.
but they're playing.
ah aren't they outside?
with Tom all together.
the little four are there.
the box of.
there's no need.
we have to take one to my house.
well there are other games in the drawer.
but the Wii, we won't be able to know which controls belong to whom really.
wue have to put a tape to yours or mine.
to the cables or something.
not that this makes a difference but.
now.
the one from Thomas didn't came out.
no I told Thomas.
take the Wii.
the controls yes because they can play four rascals of them.
to have the difference.
no, the one from here, we will take the other.
but we have to put masking tape to Tom's controls, to know whom they belong to, because I see that he already put the plastic.
Tomas does it have plastic?
or was it removed?
or he didn't put plastic?
he doesn't like plastic.
because plastics are sold in different colors.
I think they are white in the Wii.
but you can buy red, black, blue,
I didn't remember that.
they last a lot.

because that's not important.

the thing is that they have renewed my passport twice.

they have already renewed it twice, you have to get a new passport.
















the thing is that.






























the irritating one.











but she has like a bad reputation.




and you know, they told me several people have thrown out people for her, stuff like that.




the thing is that

























yeah but and not to you know not to go ahead, you know.




















I mean, I don't know who is lying.


they have exhausted me.



they have exhausted me.


































my, so now you wanna speak Spanish!



























































































































































































it'll turn into a habit.





















I don't know when they're gonna, you know, when we, yeah.






















and not even ten minutes had passed.


can I see them already?

I have just started.

















































































did you think projects in one day?



they want you to be like Chinese, eh?








we are all hot and working.


are, I'm sure this is like, like some little Chinese working there.















that, that, that is a joke.







no, that's wrong, that was a day, one to five dollars.



there were some Chinese that lived over here.









obviously it doesn't have the Nike check on it.




and he used to get my dad like tennis shoes and everything to play tennis.



the only thing is that they don't pay you.
you don't have to pay much because no you don't have the check.





but to test if like jewelry has like lead and stuff.



and depending on the, the, the sound.

he has lead or no.
































































she would have killed him, poor thing.











































and after that you came back here.
and then I came back because I didn't like it
yeah, so the dancing was really awesome.
totally
it's so much fun going out with friends
yes I totally agree
university and everything is so great
but like, it's not the same thing for me because I've always lived here and I'm used to it
yes of course
being in Colombia
and I think it happens to people
to depend one hundred percent on my dad, you know, because
oh, of course
I want that, Dad.
I want to buy deoderant daddy
I need deoderant
I need a tampon daddy
yeah
I need a tampon
yeah, and I was there.
you know what I mean.
and me twenty years old already and saying to my dad that I needed him to give me five thousand pesos to go and buy a box of tampons
quite
of course
and going out of the rumbia, I'm really into going out to eat at a good restaurant
yeah
to know places, you know
of course because
that was a change for me that I didn't
of course
I liked it, I mean, not in general, no
that makes sense
it's just that I thought that it was, if it was the other way around, a person who lives his whole life in Colombia and comes here.
they might even find it difficult to leave.
I'm not going again
yes, of course not
and it depends on where the person has lived as well.
so I've already gone back there
and obviously when I first when back I was by myself
and all my family stayed there.
mmhm
it was really hard
because I had to live at one of my uncle's houses
of course
and, well, I started to work.
and it was when I started working at the dentist's
ok
I always really liked the dentist's
I was always very involved in dentistry
yes
and I started working
but it was a 12-hour-a-day job

it wasn't light.
it was all day
and then in December my parents came with the whole family
yeah?
for a holiday
and we were skiing in New Hampshire because
oh how nice
my dad had one of those um townshares

that's um you know we go every year



what's it like?
and we went to ski
amazing to be there a week, we were skiing for fifteen days

uh so I obviously requested a holiday or whatever
ok
when it was time to go back to work, and they went back to school and that, my mum said that she wouldn't
and they stayed here
ah how nice
and then my dad bought a house and here we are
and they like it here?
well it's that we've lived here our whole lives
of course
ah and your parents as well
what happened is that my dad will always love Colombia
this is his country and he actually grew up in Colombia
which part of Colombia?
from Medellín
from Medellín
my parents are from Medellín
so he really grew up in Colombia
mmhm
for him Colombia is the best
that makes sense
exactly
like the United States for me
exactly right
I mean, in my case my life has been here.
of course
there's nothing like it, as my mum always says
I'm only not going back because I can't
I mean my dad says that it's the same for him and the United States
and whatever he has, he has it because of the United States
of course
because it is a country of opportunities.
yes

but Colombia will always be Colombia
yes I agree
and his country is Colombia, you know what I mean?
he wouldn't give up being Colombian for anything in the world
no for me as well me too I, well, I lived there for twenty, well, twenty one years
twenty twenty one years in Venezuela
in Venezuela, I mean, you are one hundred percent Venezuelan
yes I was born there and then never left
uh dad came
I mean I have always lived there.
my dad came from Colombia, he had
that he came illegally, by the way
my mum as well when they came, they came.

that's why I was born in Los Angeles
that he said
oh
when I was just talking just then oh I wasn't

it's just because there isn't
oh
yes it's no common
not exactly
my parents came through the gap, I mean Mexico
and so on
wow I mean all that adventure wow
what I meant was Colombia then Central America, Mexico and then they crossed the border to get to California
wow that's incredible.
my parents the two of them together
yes it was a big adventure
just imagine
what a nightmare
it was a risk
and my mum was already pregnant with me
how horrible how frightening
and so obviously during this, this transition, then what?
yes?
I mean my mum had me in Los Angeles
I mean, me of my five
and what did they do when they got there? I mean when they crossed the border?
what happened is that
so they were already in Los Angeles
and were they already thinking of you as did they give you?
how do they do it?
uh if you are born, you are born in that country.
no obviously in your case but how did your parents do it?
in the United States you are American
It doesn't matter because they don't have a way to catch them and let's just say um
they were
to deport them because they had already given birth in a hospital
they can't do that because it's illegal
oh yeah
ah look
it's illegal
you can't do that
you can't catch and at the same time allow a person in
it's not logical
in a medical situation catch and
yeah
yes deport them
that's not
that should be under investigation
and well actually my parents were only twenty- six twenty- seven if I'm not mistaken
and my mum was nineteen when she had me
imagine
wow it's crazy
it's super crazy my mum told me the story and I was left feeling like you do now
yes totally
it's just, I mean it's not something that you imagine for yourself
of course
you have to be someone, someone who has the guts to do that
yes I agree
and they were already living here, well, basically they lived here all the time and

obviously my parents are Colombian, I mean they don't
Yes obviously
they are American citizens now because they already fit in.
ah ok ok
but they're still Colombian
of course
and well at the end of the day they already
ah well no- it's always good to have the family here.
it's a great thing.
yes, yes
that's exactly what I say
I'm super-dependent on
I mean I'm very independent
of course
for everything that's mine
yes, yes yes
in particular
I'm a family girl
of course yes me too
I'm terrified of being alone
I'm terrified of being alone here so far away.
yeah
I love the noise my little sisters make
of course it's great
my parents and that, scolding my mum
yes, yes, yes
and
of course
like I feel with the warm love of the family
yes, apart from that they are the only ones who can really give you advice, also good advice don't you agree?
you can get to know a lot of other people
but really your family are the only ones who always
your family is your family

they were always there, and they always will be.
I didn't I learnt that after I grew up
but before we didn't have a very good relationship- when my mum was living in Venezuela.
but I think that when we moved here it changed dramatically.
because it was just the two of us living together
we had to live alone just the two of us, and we
and I was, you know we invent like that as my mom says
what happened is that you both experienced a different situation in the sense that
of course
you both depended on each other
exactly
and you only had each other
that's it
and thenn a moment comes when
and there wasn't anyone else around where you were

exactly

mmhm

the first year I wanted to go back to Venezuela you know







mmhm








mmhm


in Colombia
he graduated in Colombia









































here it's uh almost impossible

































mmhm



















mmhm

mmhm you don't need to worry

mmhm- exactly that's true






in my case, I worked from seven thirty am
mmhm






wow

wow


horrible- it was really horrible
because you're exhausted at the end of the day
yes, yes of course
no it was the same for me oh my God
no no I was totally exhausted
I'm telling you that Friday would come around and all I would wanted to do was sleep
I slept all day and the rest of the night
yeah same as me
all Saturday morning
to sleep all of Sunday was quite something
yes- so intense
and when Monday came again it would start over again
and I would say oh my god I can't believe it
I can't imagine
yes it's the same when my husband says we should go to the movies on Friday and you know that Fridays are death
Fridays are for doing nothing
what about you? Do you work Monday to Friday?
from Monday to Friday from eight o eight thirty until five
and I mean our work is really quite stressful
yes
Alicia for example says that her work is stressful
but it's a different level
mmhm


mmhm


mmhm





so it's not just the paperwork
but also that we have to do the paperwork
mmhm, yes, exactly
it's about safety you know
we just have to deal with it yeah

yes it's delicate



mmhm





sarcasm um
yes all of that











so it's really tough
dealing with people is not easy
mmhm
you wouldn't believe
and well I told you that my dad has the Subway business
yes
I work every Sunday
there
with him
in Subway
I'm the one that opens
I see
and in that shift well I'm the boss of the people who work there with me
ok
look the work is quite hard, I mean, you would think that working in Subway wouldn't be a big deal


of course

mmhm
making a sandwich, cleaning, cutting up onion and not much else
I see
but the people
yeah
seriously, seriously
the people that go there
the people are just the worst
that work or that go
it's really the people that go, the clients
there are people that just make life impossible
and I've had problems with people because there is I know
I think that there's a line, there's a limit for everything
mmhm yes I totally agree
and it doesn't matter about that saying they have here that the customer is always right



exactly



















































































exactly, it's optional



































that's exactly what I told him
because you forget that people don't respect you
they just take and take without caring
and that moment when I told him I was the owner
that I was the daughter of the owner
that guy was just standing there like
amazing
yes
it was just a Wednesday like today you know
because they I mean it's what I say to people
they think that you
they think that whoever works in a restaurant- they see them as inferior
less that them
yes- exactly
and things shouldn't be like that
and people really don't learn to be grateful
until they experience it themselves
that which is the
the waiter
yes- the worker that yes
the one who works in a restaurant
everyone
the one who might not want to give a tip
until he is in your place
uhhuh it's so true
yes I know because I worked in a retail store as well
I mean you aren't in the position to say anything
so true
that type of person is such a pain
yes of course
and I get it all the time because I'm the owner
yes
so it's pretty much aimed at me
yes you can
I don't even have a manager that is screwing me over
exactly
I don't fight with any of the employees either because they all have to respect me- well I'm the owner of the place as well
obviously
and well if I have a problem with a customer as well I say look
you yourself have the right of course
do you like it?
well
if not goodbye
yes at least
well it gives me an advantage
but for a person
that is there yeah gasp
if a person is like that with my employees
they have to shut up and keep quiet you always have to stay quiet of course
to say to them they stay quiet but they talk to them like that
let me tell you what I end up hearing
what I end up seeing with one of my employees
and I told the employee the same thing I just told you
sure
sure
but people don't you know
ah that's horrible
people, people are like that
it's unbelievable someone someone
yes
and you don't just don't believe it until they've been in the office
I'm just saying I work with a doctor with an excellent doctor
I'm not sure you've heard of him until now
he left they said to him a celebrity doctor especially the
what's his name
Roberto Javier Gutiérrez
I've probably seen him
he's Colombian from Baranquilla
and well he has done makeovers for actresses and actors from Mexico, Colombia what have you
ok oh
He's gone to Selma I've heard there are heaps of people there
yes
yes yes
so he recognised me
and really most of our patients are patients you know
yes yes
who have quite a high economic status
mmhm yeah
they're not patients that come with insurance
yea of course
a few have it yes
but ninety percent of the patients are pure daily cash income

so you know you would think that there is a general feeling that they are well educated
um yeah
the people with money
no it's the other way round
that they really aren't
they're ruder
and look at people without as much money or economic resources
more often we're so much more respectful
they are more respectful and humble
yeah it's true
and to the doctor that treats them
mmhm
they talk like this yes sir no sir and I don't know what else
yeah yeah
well educated, if you have to pay for something don't put in a complaint about how you have to pay because went and received a service
I agree
Oh God
now rich people are arrogant and uneducated
yes, yes, yes
you get it they are people
they think that they're
ignorant in their world because really the treat the whole world like shit so
yes yes yes
practically
and things don't have to be like that
you're right it's unbelievable
it's unbelievable I promise you that
you can't buy education I think that it's something that comes from your family from how you're raised and so on
exactly
exactly but there are people that arrive there are really
there are also patients with a lot of money
we have French patients
yes
we have a French couple who have been with the doctor for at least ten years
and the man is the most polite man that I have ever met
yes wow
that's to say he's a gentleman
that's why I'm saying that they are people
and they have money you can't even imagine
indeed
but he is very well- mannered
and you know what I think that there are also people who've had money since the day they were born
yes from the cradle
usually they are the ones that get a good upbringing
but people who might have been rich or famous or a celebrity
not those, you know, maybe, if they're rich, they might have been made rich overnight
exactly
if those people
they call it new money
yes those people get famous and forget everything
but I'll also admit that where I worked was a retail store I was almost in tears from the stunts that the customers pulled the horrible way they treated me
really
they treat you horribly I swear to God
sorry where do you work again?
in Brooks Brothers
ok
there was that I mean I almost never had I you know the difficulties with clients because they treated me as a person on a different level
or whatever it's not just anyone who shops there
they are people who are already going to know what they want they don't bother you much about I don't know what
but there are also the client well the stores close at nine thirty pm
and they come in a nine twenty- five and dismantle the whole shop and
and so they're being arrogant because you told them that the shops were just about to shut
and so they always say that you're trying to get rid of them that I don't know what
those kind of people got you into a mess and then don't buy anything
mmhm
and that's a shocker
but that's that
yes
one time I got this couple who I was trying to help the guy was carrying so many shirts
and he was with his wife and I said to him
well would you like me to it's that you're carrying so many can I carry a few
and here we don't do commision so I know it's my sale and someone was going to fight me
no I said it so that the guy could walk around the store more easily
and he
no no
the woman pulled this face
no no relax
he got nervous and so
after a moment I saw him with more things and said to him
don't worry
put them here and anything you want to try on so that you're a bit more comfortable.
and the woman just
of course all of this was in English
the woman had started to say a thousand dreadful things in Spanish
she thought that I was a gringa that I was an American
so
this idiot who I don't know what because it's not going like this.
and so I said to her in Spanish
no relax don't worry
because I'll keep everything that he's holding here and there won't be a problem
and as I said that the woman looked as if she wanted to die
because she'd said all those dreadful things and she knew that because
yes, of course because she, she thought, let's call whatever to this silly girl
yes, she was a nasty piece of work if ever I saw one
I mean, yes
but of course I'm saying nasty
but she called me so many names
and was such a pain to the man
and later she said to the manager
ah she wasn't attentive enough for me to give her the sale
and I say to them
no, don't worry, because here we don't earn on commision
or whatever it would have annoyed her because she was saying that crap because we gave her the sale
yes of course
and I go
no, here you work by the hour
to help her exactly
to help people like you
no people I'm telling you
yes it's hard to believe
and they scream at you
and make you look like an idiot in front of whoever happens to be there and you just wish the earth would swallow you up
I can imagine it's awful
and I believe me that after I started working my mom because I told her all about working there
every time that we went out listen the huge tips I mean because one says oh my God these people
one learns from experience that yes really yes
or whatever, and if you see someone who's in a bad mood
or whatever, let them be with their bad mood.
because you don't know who it was that came before you to say something to them
they might have been insulted
they might have been told anything
and the poor thing a reaction
I mean you're not going to be you know
I know
and people just don't get it
or more like I think that someone is grumpy because they don't like their job or something
or that you don't know what happened before you arrived
that's it
or your boss said something to you
Or something happened to you. You can't know.
or it could be that this judge or whatever
well if you didn't like your work you forget that you don't like it
and you go on to judge other people really quickly
yes
but to know to understand what someone is going through
then I see someone in a bad mood and you try to
make them you know better do something nice say something so that their day isn't going so badly
of course
it's not easy actually
hmm
and customer service, for people working in customer service, that's terrifying
I wouldn't know what.
My husband worked in telephone services
and he had the chance to work for Direct TV once
but then he used phones and that's not as personal
that's what I said to him
it's something more indirect because
absolutely but just as
you can hide how irritated you are
and you can want to explore
clap and hang up the phone
and punch the wall
or hang up and say that you dropped the call, or something silly like that!
of course
because you don't actually have that contact
yes- physically no
like you would in person
yeah
when it's already the thing is you know in person
yes
it's pretty hard
absolutely
because the thing is to learn to control yourself
yeah
you're providing a service
yes, to be diplomatic
but sometimes you don't you don't feel like being diplomatic
no but the diplomacy makes me
I swear to you that sometimes they make me want to grab them and
to be in that state already
yes
really, because imagine
and you wouldn't believe what happens in a medical office.
yes, these things happen
you would say that people would be respectful because at least it's a doctor
there are people that come in and say awful things to the doctor!
to the doctor
Oh my God!
and it's that the doctor he's well my boss is a gentlemean
he would never say anything to anyone
I mean you can say you look I don't agree with you or something
mmhm
but always
yes he's always composed
he might be raging inside.
because then there he comes
that's why, behind, why
oh how funny!
he's thirty nine years old
imagine!
he's young he's so young
yes he's young obviously
and you see him and he looks really good really
and but he's always you know he makes anyone nervous
yes
one of these days, a patient arrived
and what happens is that he also sometimes does things badly
yes
because instead of for example relying on the schedule and all that
mmhm
he takes
yes he takes his time
and he goes around telling his patient friends, he tells them
come whenever, come any time, and whatever
and I'll tell a patient you've come for a cleaning
oh
yes
at, I don't remember what time I told him
the thing is that at this time
he told them, yes
the hygienist had
mmhm
patient for cleaning
mmhm
this guy arrives
he tells the hygenist that he needs to see him
and the patient that is on the road and will arrive in five minutes hangs up
the appointment at nine and it was already eight forty- five or close to it.
so then I confirm it with him
and I say to him we're ready perfect
and including Alma who is the hygenist who was the one to answer the phone
and it was really her who confirmed the appointment
yes
I told him that ok she was waiting perfect.
the gentleman arrives
who by the way is Venezuelan
oh gosh!
I won't tell you his name because if I tell you the name I don't know you know
no and the Venezuelans are
do you know who it is?
Venezuelans are so difficult all the time.
they're rude there are people who are really rude
when they shop when they sell for everything
I mean nothing personal
I believe what I see. I look and pass myself off as Colombian or whatever
nothing personal
nothing personal, but yes, some of them are really rude people.
they they are difficult
so he comes in and he says
look I need to see him now.
and she says, the hygienist tells him
look eh I can't see anyone at the moment.
yeah
I've just hung up the phone with the patient that's on his way
he just confirmed with me.
he told me he's coming in five minutes
if you want eh
after her of course
wait for me
and I'll be done with her in about forty minutes.
I'll do a cleaning for you
that man
did something scandalous in that office
who was it?
his name is Juan García
Juan?
García
you have to know who he is.
García?
he's a designer
and does a program on radio
I think that it's About Romance or About Love
oh I don't know him
ah yes
he has various boutiques here and everything
ok Juan no no I don't know
well I buy lots of those things I don't know, a lot
ok
that man did something scandalous in that office.
oh how horrible!
they're so rude
but the type of scandal that he told her, she told him

mmhm
and he goes and tells her
no, but I need you to see me now.
it's that Robert
he doesn't even say, the doctor
it's that Roberto told me he would come at whatever time and he's late.
oh My God what if it was an intimate friend
arrived a bit later than what he told me
you are going to tell me that you're not going to see me and whatever and
so she told him that she was sorry that she if he would like she would wait
this was at the front desk in the reception
mmhm
she comes in
talks to, of course
in her room
in another we had another patient in a room
the poor lady, an old lady
she looked about fifty years old
imagine having to listen to the whole affair
and he had waited outside
and I stayed doing paperwork at the reception.
because he came later
ok
after that the telephone rang and blah, blah, blah
and this man started
doing whatever the hell he was doing
that woman doesn't want to attend to me
she has been doing, look, answering calls, because the woman from emergency was calling his mobile and he was ignoring her calls
and she didn't want to attend to me
and then I talked with this other woman who's another patient
I don't care who it could be
I am Juan García
what?
I know!
I was like
and then I didn't say anything because I didn't want to put my foot in it
because then the problem would have just got worse
yes of course
and I was like
I'm telling you
but inside I'm saying son of a bitch or whatever
this man who?
oh my God!
where is the respect?
where is it?
he is supposedly famous
yes yes
the etiquette the
exactly
this man comes in in a fury
and he stopped like this
he opened the reception door
he threw it open into the consulting room.
and he's in front of this woman
oh I can't believe it
and he screams like this
ah I don't know
you are not going to touch my mouth
I don't want you to open my mouth
I don't want you to touch my mouth.'
but it was a class act
that I
and the other doctor never came out to see
no, I was afraid and was already starting to look for one of the fire extinguishers to hit him in the head
because he touched Alma
and you forget that with his name
of course
and he goes to hit here we had him between us
but that kind of guy
this is a true story
has to have a bat
a really aggressive type

there's no need for that
if you don't want to wait then and and you say to him
look you know that you don't
I don't want you to do the cleaning
exactly yes
I don't need to I'm going to wait for the doctor
and maybe finally you show him that you're annoyed
but you don't exaggerate either
exactly but you're not going to yell like that
hello, dad?
good, and how are you?
yes.
yes yes yes.
yes, soon, God willing.


yes I believe that when you hit the fence
yes for me he has a

oh, dad, I haven't had a chance today.
I had forgotten about it
let me call now.
ok, there's no problem.
yes.
well, that's what the man says.
I don't know.
and I told him how is that possible if we are earning money from it.
but, well, anyway, although we don't save.
I can work out the interest of the house.
not the one for the credit card.
er, no.
well, it's not the same.

once.
me neither.
no, yes, exactly.
yes, and did everyone come or not?
dear me!
Pedro told me.
we're offering drinks to everybody.
and I.
oh God.
oh.
yes.
oh.
yes because, for you, as I did not eat papaya because I don't like it too much.
no.
ok
hello, how are you?
everything he likes.



they are not telling you, giving you work or something?
because Dad says that you didn't feel very well.
that you didn't feel very well.



I didn't make anything.
well, if you don't like it, too bad.

eh, well, yes.
yes, yes.
if it isn't too annoying for you, if not, I'll stay at home.

yes
oh, the cabin hubs

oh God.
what did he bring?
ah, one egg.
but a plastic one or?
oh God.
but it was for?
ah, it wasn't for
eh.
it wasn't for eating.

ah, well.
yes
ok then.
ah, ok.
well, see you later.
hey, hey, hey.






can you give me some of your binder thingumajigs?
those thingies?


I told Bart that if he finds someday our "friend" Gerardo, that I'm going to kill him because he brought me all the folders, you know they're supposed to give you a binder.
and it's easier for me to place it myself than send it back and everything.
he tells me.
don't worry, I'm going to sell tickets.
then people are going to have to come back to life, we kill them, we bring them back to life, we kill them.

uh, and then we kill them.

and those little machines that fall into the water.


look, who orders a green t-shirt, so nice.






let me see, did you already put away your pink shirt?
oh pink, it's horrible.
fuck, it's pink.


yes.
look, but you rolled out the red carpet or what?






























look, but they are small for you.
I would go barefoot If I were you.






































hi, Patty?
fine, how are you?
good, really good.
I see that Caleb took all the brothers with him.
no, no no, they wanted, he wanted to go to the grandparents' house.

no, no, no, he wanted to spend all afternoon at the grandparents' house, in my mum and dad's house.
no, no, no.
they were prepared already.
yes, early, yes.
so, so he can go whenever he'll be ready to go.
ah, well.
yes, no, no, I'm going to pick them up at my mum's house.
fine.
see you tomorrow.
fine, see you tomorrow.




















oh my God, that sounds like the key stone, what's on first, what, who's on second.




















give me a pair of scissors.
please.

no, cutting the box.
to take the copy paper out.













one that, you can drive it but.




















































I think that you're the one.
was it you or not?










I told them.





a little.

this one.
this one really suited me, honestly.
I don't know why.
Beth told me.
look, I can't see any gray hair.



ah, it's you.
I thought you were burning.
remember to disconnect it.
hell, what's wrong with this stupid thing?







aha, it's you, causing issues.
no, this one, what's his name, Edelmiro.
he was toasting his

and they are like pink Pop Tarts.



any bottle up there?
no because there wasn't any bottle up there.


because you know, I was, I didn't even pay attention.

here I have my lunch for tomorrow.

did you see it?
it's really clean.
it's really clean.
no, I'm checking it out too.
to the trash can.
they can come.
and scold me.
they can come.
and say whatever.
let's see if they are brave enough to do it.
fine.
































ah, Mike.








































































there is tomato soup and three croquettes.

there's more croquettes.


































ah, I know.


oh, are you going to cut your hair short like Connor's?
and then he said.
no, not short, it's very, it is too small for me.
too bad.



but what else?
what were we talking about before this?
the usual, isn't it?

well.

my Chinese class is really interesting.
but how come, I mean.
oh my goodness, but there are so many things.
yes, so.
today I missed class.
I didn't go.
because I couldn't park.
terrible.
no.
I didn't go to class.



it's like maths.


it's great.



heh.



no, look, really.

so then, today they are voting.
there are elections at school.
was asking, I mean
what the hell is the point of being


to serve the University
well supposedly the ideal thing would be to serve the community and represent the students' interests.
to the university administration.
so that's why they do it.

but I think the students act like.









people usually made when I was eating lunch

































yeah?

they prefer to be like this, like seeeing
and that the man is still there then.


























I want to live here, yes, because it's great.
why?
it's super cool.
look, I have everything.
I have somewhere to get my hair cut here.
I have somewhere to wash my clothes here.
I have
no, but there's only dry cleaning.

oh your, but, you do dry, you do dry clean for all your clothes?
but to wash you get a.
no, but for things, fairly big things.
but.

for example, for normal clothes or so there must be a laundry around here.
where?

maybe in the, in the bedrooms.
or even in the apartments.
in the bedrooms they have a laundry room.




yeah.
actually, I want to go to China.
and I would like it.
and live there.
and teach.
but the thing is that it's too many months and.
and like, I'm involved with the church.
so sometimes I don't see myself, like, in another country for more than a, months.
for example.



because if, for instance if, so if, God sends you over there.
it has to be like that, I mean
it's, like, like there's, I was watching a, a film.
I see.
about a guy who lived in the UK.


and God tells him, he wakes him up one night.
and tells him that he has to go to California.
aha.
to California.
but that there's going to be a family there that speaks, a Mexican family.
aha.
and then he says.

aha.

aha.




















you're not going to have any, you're not going to have a lack in the area


















oh my God, I wanna see.

























like Rome or I don't know.




I want

there's an orphanage in Mozambique.
and super cool.
you can go to volunteer, volunteer there.
it's fantastic.
I wanna go.
I love all those things.
my friend went to the Ukraine for a
well he went there every summer for forty five days.

what?




they don't put in Venezuela because of the political situation, I imagine.



most of them go to Africa, wow.


because there is a big necessity in Africa.
















but in the church people told us.
don't stop because the people were so small.
aha.
that we, because.
church is very traditional there.
where people are staying.
hallelujah
so when we stopped they told us.
don't stop because then people can't see in front of them because they are all really short.

and in front of the church there is a field of pure corn
and we take pictures there.
and everyone is surrounded by corn, all of them, small there.
it's great.
I liked it.

and there in the churches we danced for hours and hours
it was fantastic.
it was a party.
yes.
of the.
the church began, at seven o'clock.
we went there at midnight.
and it was first the service and it was so cool because there they didn't preach.
it was all the people.

and dancing and dancing there for hours in God's presence.
or even not dancing, they were not dancing with each other.
it was, and, you like, everyone, like, in their own moment with God.
in their own moment, yes.
yeah.


we went to the markets.
that's fantastic.
but the only country I know from South America is my own.





















I know of that because in my history class we're looking at all that.
aha.
oh my goodness, but it's too much.
like, when we saw Rome.

I said, I want to go to Rome now.
we were also looking at the, Egypt and all that.
aha.
I also want to go there.
just now we're looking, it is this exactly.
to Mexico, South America.
wow you made me a dream I had about Italy.

talking about Rome.
go on.
and so we're looking at the ruins of Machu Picchu, Tenochtitlán, and all that about the, about the Mayan Aztecs.
and is it all really interesting?
yes.
so I see them and I.





I want to experience all that.
but I want
go on.

just to see everything.
great
yes.
because it's cool.
I've dreamed about two places.
and without having ever been there.
one is China.
I dreamt I was in China.
I was in front of a university in China.
but there was an attack on the buses.
students were being attacked.
and we sat there at the side.
and all students were running.
weird.
and the other dream was me playing football in Italy.

what am I dreaming weird.
there were some streets that were like this.
the streets, instead of the streets being made of concrete.
they were made of these little blocks.
and I was playing soccer.
and we went into the
and there was a circle where they were, around buildings.
and inside there I was playing soccer.
and I.
how weird.

isn't that the place where Borat was from?




no, where?




















yes, sure.







because if for example I mean in, in the case you're going to Morocco if you are there you can't say.
I'm going to Spain.
unless something happens and, and they say.
that's why it is so great to be here, like, having a life with God.
they tell me
look, it turns out that you're needed in Spain this weekend because a family such-and-such
and you go down there.
yes, but, if, if, if.

if you are in Morocco, only that.
so that you can serve in Morocco.
because that's what you are for.
Spain isn't here, so.

because it is not a
but if some weekend you want to go to Morocco.

to Spain
oh, in Spain.

























































yeah, a, it's a long time, yeah?











but, but it's about helping people and all that.
look at that thin cow.

even the cow is
are you sure that it is a cow?
yes.






they can't eat it.
if they kill them you only get bones.
bone.




let me see.







I will tell him later what was it.

I feel sorry, I didn't want to reject him.

it was a friend.
but I will tell him later.
ah, we were recording something.

but, anyway not
he could come.
really?
yes.
oh, I didn't know.

he told you.



ah, ok ok.
anyway.

what's that?


where?


what are you talking about?
oh no!
a butterfly.
pink and black.
there are balls up there.
I don't know.
are you having fun now?
I believe.
did you see that the ceiling is super cool?
yes, do you like the design?

do you like the design?
yes and no.
I mean, it's like.
I don't like it.
experiencing it.
it gets dirty.
you see it.
this is what architecture is about.
about what?
about experiencing everything and see it.
I mean, I have, when one studies that, one changes the concept in which you see everything.
one start, you start to develop, like to develop these things about seeing everything different, in a different way.

then how do you see this scenario.
you know, I see it and like I get inspired to do something.
I'm seeing it from, I don't pay attention to the space but to the structure.
I pay attention to how the flow of people is.
to the light.
to the fact that it is very dark.
isn't it right?
it is very dark.
yes, because they wanted to make.
and it is like very.
to make something quite solid, but they wanted to keep the connection between this part of the college and the other one.
because if there hadn't been this cavity here people would have had to turn around completely.

then what could have they done?
nothing, this was the only option.
but since the library is si huge, you gotta make a whole to make a room over there.
yeah, but how do they, how will, how can you improve it?








whether there is breeze outside or not, the air is always going to go into here.
breeze.
imagine it.

all the air is outside but it comes into by a little hole like this.
it is always going to flow.
after that this part is always going to be fresh like that.
buy they could have make it clearer by putting a clearer floor.
yes but.
instead of made of concrete, this with a marble floor would look super cool.
yes.
or instead of using grey paint, using clear paint.
yes, but after that it gets very slippery.

this is the thing.
but and if do you know what I picture as well?
two buildings, the library divided into two buildings and then in the middle a corridor that the people can cross to the other part of the library.
and then there would be room.

but the building would be the same size, but you are taking away all this room for that corridor.
yes.
is, is.
so
you are using.
you are using space.

that it's called efficiency.
or well, that cavity higher.
and the building higher.
I mean, it's still seven feet.
but everything higher to make the cavity longer.

but more, bot for the people.
I mean, is like.
this is, but this is the issue.



like yesterday for example in the house, in the bookstore in front of, I like, I liked that spot.
what spot?
the little spot where there are all the paintings on the wall.
ah yes.
and there are a few chairs.
so it feels all. like, comfortable that.
there, there everything.
yes.
you can lay down there.
but what happens is that you have, that when you are already into these things in architecture and that, you have to see that there is a lot of things you have to.
money interests?
of course, because of the budget.
you design, but you are not the one paying for the design.
yes.


but if you totally had to
I mean.
then they.
if
they say more or les we can spend this much.
but you have to adjust to that.
but let's say.
I'm not talking about actual reallistic jobs.
I'm talking about creativity.
I mean you design something because you like it because, aesthetically.
like because you like it.
yesterday I ate one this big.
what has bread to do with
I'm hungry now, I want
no, because I saw you yawning.
I want to eat.
I ate some of Janes' potatoes.


and how is Jane?

there, at home.
when I saw she the first day I was well with her.
I don't know if she told you.
oh yes.
I told her.
Jane, enough, please.
oh no.
shut up.
oh but oh oh.
she told me.
oh oh Connor.
but from Gabrielle!


oh my gosh.
I didn't expect that.
excuse me and forgive me.
but where was it left?
ah no no.
where what was left.
she said.
where was the Christianity left and.
no, man, no.
that can't be done.
no.
I told her.
but she was focusing.
yeah.
oh, I don't know.


but did you really do that?
she, but look.
it's like.
no.
I told her.
take the camera.
and I went away.
because it was boling, my blood was boiling.
I didn't know what to do.

because look.
I was attracting people.
and this one comes.
and it was a big group.
and it was Sunday.
I was there just for four hours.
and she threw herself just in front of me.
I mean, not even, she threw herself in front of me.
she took my customer.
she took him away.
she took pictures.
to the customer came three of four members of his family.
and she took photos of everyone.
and she sold them and that's it.
it counted for her number.
then I.
oh Jane, I go along with you, but I don't know.
do not go too far.
I mean.
and what she told me is that you already had a lot of people there.
you were taking pictures, then another person came.
no.
she took him from me before that.
nobody came.
she started twisting the story later.
no, it is to help you.
no Jane, it wasn't to help me.
you attracted him before I could make him go to the camera.
then I, that's why I got angry because she assumed and took
I felt she was taking advantage of our friendship.
I mean, like se was laughing and everything.
she took the customer.
and I went away.
but either way it was a lesson because look.
when I was boiling, right?
and I heard the Lord saying.
calm down, calm down, calm down.
then God told me.
do not worry because I'm going to send you a sale which is going to be greater.
but I wasn't patient to express, to have faith in the Lord.
because of that when anoher customer came in and I heard that something said.
this is the customer.
this one is going to buy a lot.
but then Jane came and again she was going to take the camera.
and I, that's when I got mad.
and I told her.
take the camera.
and I went away.
because she playing.
come on, I will do it for you.
like that laughing again.
and me.
oh, take the camera.
and I walked away.
then I came back.
and I told her.
look.
and she told me.
oh. why did you get so angry and so on.
whatever.
and I told her.

I told her.
I preferred not to react like that.
obviously I wouldn't have liked to react like that.
but I got angry because I felt you were, like, going too far.
and then we talked about it.
and it ended up.
the customer that stayed was served by Marta.
and she sold him seventy dollars, which was more than what Jane had sold them.
I mean God was right.
he was sending me the customer
but I was not patient enough to wait
and let the anger dissapear.
do you understand me?
then there I learnt.
because she was getting upset
and I told her.
but you have no reason to get upset.
she has no reason to be upset because of anything if she started.
I mean.
do you understand me?

that was only a person then.
no, it is it was coming.
no.
it was a big family.
but I attracted one person.
and she took away that person from me.
then sonce she took him away I served his brother or friend.
later more people came, but she took people, photos to all of them.
she even told the whole group to stand together
and she took photos of them.
black pudding?
I don't know.
the black pudding thing was a lot of black people
yes, it was a lot of black people together.
she said.
say black pudding!
yes and they said black pudding.
because there were forty black people.
aha, them.
then I was already seeing myself.
it's like my blood was boiling little by little.
she first attracted my customer.
and she said.
ah it doesn't matter.
then another one came, and another, and another.
and after that the whole family came
and she sold them another.
and she hadn't, she didn't even ask me once.
Gabrielle, shall I help you?
or are they yours.
or nothing nothing nothing.
then I got like.
and after that all this and that's it.
serving them all.
that made me upset.
bad bad bad.
I was annoyed.
Marta understood me.
she was like each one has a glass.
and if you keep filling it.
and I, she told Jane that she was overreacting because I just went away.
she said.
it was better that you went away than exploding here.
but me in myself I feel like I have.
how do you say standard in Spanish?

a standard.
I have a higher standard.
I would have never exploded there.
to the, by the, I mean, I was not planning it.
for me what I did going away, that was an explosion.
I mean for my personality I consider it an explosion.
although Marta said.
it was not good what you did.
you went away instead of saying something.
or behaving badly here.
that's good.
but I felt that I didn't go away.
but this is, in that moment I should have applied the blood of Jesus because there was no way to control what was going on inside of me.
then I felt terribly bad.
but of course it hurts.
I mean it hurts because I don't want to damage my relationship with her.

do you understand me?
what do you think?
what can I do now it's over?
I would have preferred not having done so.
I saw.
wow Lord, if I had been pacient you would have blessed me even more.
and I would have spoken with her quietly.
but in that moment I didn't have self control.


it doesn't matter, they don't understand Spanish.
yes no because Jane, Jane.
the story she told me is a little bit different.
she and then she says to Marta.
shut your mouth.
and then Marta says.
did she say shut your mouth?
that's what Marta said to, what she said.
and after that Marta said.
you told me that.
and then Jane.
no, I didn't say that.
then there another hour speaking with Marta.

arguing whether or not she said shut your mouth.
and I ah Lord please.
I don't believe Jane said shut your mouth.
she, what she told me is that she was talking to you
and that Marta came.
Jane whatever whatever.
and she said.
Marta wait because I'm talking to Gabrielle.
aha, but Marta does not like it because she is the manager.
yes but I understand her and such.
but I laughed, no, it's too much.



let's see?



what's that?
oh, she said yes?
and are they going or not?

it is at Boca, right?
in the, right?
let me write it down in my calendar.
because you know me, I forget things.


less than the price they had for us.




how cheeky!



yes.





oh, you are so old.










she was taking years off.
he used to tell her.
Cristina, please.


















she doesn't remember anymore.
and my dad says.
you know, she doesn't even remember anymore.
she has been taking years off since I know her, when she was only thirty-two years old.











































































































they were in a box, a cage.


































































































































































there it is.
all yours.
shall I send it to you?
so that you have the electronic?


what how did you find out?





well, but it's not only that.
we are not the only ones.



they sent something.


look, until now.
because it says due date January.
yes, yes, yes, but they just







look there.


I don't know them, but






just like
exactly.
and they've been doing this for years.

yes, exactly.
if we were the only ones
I caught her, yes.
but we are not the only ones.
there are others.
no, honestly.
yes, yes.
but you see, why?



for me it's something.


well, then one needs to complain.



yes, because I











I told him.
but Jeff, they were
and he said.
it's a public fail form.
but the
in county they have that big lounge.

but in county is not as comfy as that.
imagine our conference hall, small.
it has a table with four or five cats sitting there.
and then you come in and present.
I mean, there's no audience space.
it's not like the one in, where they hold them in a big trailer.

but he said.

I guess yesterday they left from here.
and they didn't turn off the lights.
it wasn't me.
are you?
it seems the most likely.
I know that I've come.
I have been one of the first ones to come.
I said.
I have been one of the first ones to come.
and I have found the lights
but I don't know if maybe the cleaning group.
look, eh eh
do you use these papers for your daughters to paint?











but if they are covered from




and they end up like this.

Paul has a little tablecloth.
there because it was a present from my brother.



pass it over here.
pass it over here.




















































no, that is what I told Hannah.


































ah, ok.



































I like this little shirt.
I am going to check if they have other colours.
I have already forgotten which was the brand.
yes, but with a new customer.



I should do that, because it's through my


but just in case someone
because Patrick told me that he didn't know what type ordering.
Nor Hannah.



because twenty-five dollars are twenty-five dollars.






it wasn't so expensive.
that was the one.
I am almost sure that was the one.
that is the one.
no, it's not that one.
no, it's not that one.
don't you have a white option?



I think it was twenty pesos
it was the twenty pesos one.

that was the one.

and light blue, forget it.

what is, the discounted one?
that's not bad.
no, it is the navy one.

and light blue.





and at the end they put, they put like, ah, like a shot.
they put it and like.
he could choose either a shot or pills, have some pills or go out and get mad at everybody.



yeah like an assasisn because they already had a community over there.






they didn't kill their own people
they killed people like us.
but exactly that's like that's killing people.




they adapted to their kind of life.
















ah it's like like you know like they focus that it was like it's leaving like this you know.
but in the book there is a girl that betrayed him that pretends she is human.
and she is not human
she is of a different type.









so like there's no way that she can pass for human is she looks like a zombie.
but she was healing in the movie, she was healing.

that one that one she was healing.

when he is going to give it to her, he gives her a shot and she tranforms herself again.


later she, in the end, she was, like, more passive.
and he gives her something, the guy gives her a shot of something else that he had.
and she transforms into a monster again.

then they close the door and that's it.


































bro that program in channel two where people are a family.
and they speak English and Spanish.



it's an old program.
that in the yeah I know.








is it called Qué Pasa USA?

er he was telling me that he wants to record those programs.































he painted seven picture before he died.





that he's like, like a dead person who looks like a dead person with a shot in the glass.













































you know like the profile?

and I said
that's Ando!


he is a model, I think.


got to go to Wikipedia the online encyclopaedia.

and put the profile there.
he comes out, Micah comes out.

the guy.

D L comes out.
it comes out.
who else comes out?
Nathan comes out.



Peter also comes out.
this guy, the Hindu, also comes out.

no.


the Hindu, I don't remember what he was, he is from Chicago.










she is always in the same.













you saw that part that he lets her fall and she falls and.



no no no no there is a part that the annoying chearleader is drinking





there is a part that she is drinking.
and they want to scare her as a lesson.
and then they plan something.
and he puts on a mask.
and he goes up
and lets her fall.
and he hopes to look like a ghost to her, you know, to scare her.

and she tells him that the police is coming and then Claire comes and then Claire is normal and then the guy comes and it looks like she is crazy.




but you know the first part shows more.


yeah in the first part more is shown.



mmhm.
























ah?
















but in this one he is not doing anything.





Peter and Nathan beacuse the in the

as soon as they come back from the past.

when they show you the part from four months ago.



foru months ago you saw that Nathan you can see him with his burnt face.

it's when he goes up, when they go up.

he starts to burn him.
and then you want to know how he got cured completely.

because then he is completely cured you know.









the uh she's another stupid one always the same thing.















they go to a hospital and they cure him you know they














mmhm.































































for me he is so annoying.

most of the time annoying, but sometimes he could be cool

but I dunno he gets a little annoying sometimes.
sometimes ay they still they still putting Jumper there.























I saw that this guy had a camera like a journalist.

he had a camera.
and they took his camera away.
and they checked the video that they filmed.


they make you say what happened.

mmhm.




and they uh like the security guard the security of the bodyguard of the.



































































but he is too serious for that movie.
it's like putting Anthony Hopkins in that movie.



nah they are actors.

but they are very serious for those movies.



the uh the actor The Rock

















and he got they got they got like thousand thousand movies on Blockbuster you know.

aha.



















aha.
































I wanna see whether they're, like, Perfume or whether it's, like, a sort of comedy.


like the old times.

it was older than Perfume yeah.

I saw that that guy from Shoot Em UP works there.






you know the the bad guy the bad guy in part two?
the one who has, the Cuban who has long hair.

the bad one.
he says he is going to give a million pesos to the one who frees him from jail.

um the ba one in The Golge Ange.

the king of Spain the bad one.


the skinny one.

isn't it the one in which



and he's, like, don't pay attention, he is a sucker.

isn't it that one where they destroy the whole Spanish fleet.

they destroyed the whole Spanish fleet.

is it in that one?
I think it was the biggest destruction that Spain has had since the war.
isn't that where they burn people alive because they are Catholic or something like that?

that.



that type of movie confuses me.
but lilke I watch them with my girlfriend and she explains.




I've seen the, this is a, it was a documentary.
about what happened in reality with, this guy who foresees the future.




that this documentary was very harsh.



aha.
she goes to Nostradamus.
oh yeah?
a I don't know if it's Nostradamus but it's a prophet.
aha.
that can tell what's going to happen in the future.

he tells a king what's going to happen.
and in reality something happens to the king.
and so that's when people get upset.

when are we going out?
I don't know, one of these days
but this weekend
what?
I said out only today
why?
well, because it's Estrella's birthday tonight
Estrella who?
Toni's cousin, and she's celebrating at
are you going?
I wanted to go
but then imagine, they'll all be there, no way, I didn't even get up to go to class
and does your mom know that, or doesn't she know when you have to go?
yeah, she knows when I have to go
and she didn't say anything?
all she did was wake me up and I woke up
no
and so I came and got into bed with her and fell asleep
you're so stupid!
well, I got up and pretended I was going to class and I got lazy and got into bed with her
no way
and we fell asleep
no way, my mom wouldn't have let me do that
she would have said, go to school, you stupid kid
my mom doesn't let me stay in
oh
you can go back to sleep with me

so yeah, but like my mom doesn't do that
my mom says, wake up and fuck off
no such thing as staying in bed with me, and even if you stay with me, I'll say, get up and go to class
yeah, man, but I don't know, right now I have to go to the university because I'm going to register for some classes, plus now I have to take a whole bunch of classes
how many classes?
three
how many were you taking?
no, well, now I have to study all day, man, I'm screwed, really
but you're not wasting time
no kidding, then when you look the years have gone by and you'll be way behind
exactly
so I'm going to register and I'm going to study, I don't know, I think maybe all day
I'll get there in the morning around nine
and you're not going to work
you can come to lunch
oh
I don't think so
why?
because no, I have to work

are you no longer at the airport?
not really, but mom says I don't really have to work
well, cool, if they're going to give you everything
yes
but no kidding, man, once like you start working it's like, even if you stop working and even if they're paying everything, brother, it's like, I don't know, don't you feel weird because you were already used to doing whatever you wanted, you know?
and doing whatever you felt like
yeah, man
yeah, man
I mean, yeah
but we'll see

in any case, I'm going to get a part-time at the weekends
right dude, a little part-time there, cool, some extra dough there, does you no harm at all
mmhm, I'm going to sell it there on Eighth Street
you're so stupid, it's too cheap there, stupid
is it too cheap?
yes
go somewhere else
yeah I'm going to be there at Aeropostale with a friend of mine
what friend?
a long-haired girl
which friend, stupid, do I know her?
her name is Marta
you're so stupid!
come on
you jerk, I thought you were being serious, you're so stupid

I'm, which long haired chick, really brother, every chick working there has long hair
I'm such a moron
her name is Marta, Martita
that Marta is so stupid
go on, apply, they're hiring right now
what crap, I think that shit is too far
oh
it's too far for me
well, that's true
but OK, apply at a mall closer to your house
what's the closest mall?
no kidding, man, Southland mall, or Dadeland mall
so go to Dadeland, no, Dadeland doesn't have Aeros
yeah, Dadeland has Aeropostale, brother, go and apply there
it does
huh?

yeah, it does, go and apply there, stupid
yeah, we'll see
I also want to get hired at a nice store like, I don't know, Express, some shit like that
well, so, apply there, you idiot
like, honestly, I don't recommend Aeros
because they pay shit, man
how much do they pay?
seven twenty-five
I already quit
so you quit, then?
I mean, I'm still there, but I already quit like, Saturday is my last day
yeah
and now what are you going to do?
I mean, I still have my job at Univisión
and I applied to the Marriott because this guy Ryan told me
apply, they'll call you, so I don't know
he said, they'll call you soon
the guy has been asking me, have they called you, have they called you?
and then fuck all, they haven't called me at all, I tell him
so I'll call him
in a bit I'll call and ask him, now that you reminded me
and I applied at Bestbuy, they say it's good there
so, like, I'm going to apply at various places to see what happens, like
so for now I'm not going to stay here without doing anything because this coming week we're taping, so I'm going to be working even though I have spring break so I'm not going to class, thank God
so I'm going to save all that, I'm going to save all that in gas, because that's a punishing trip
it
where's your university?
huh?
where's your university?
at Miramar, almost Fort Lauderdale
and why?
because it's there, OK, what do you want me to do?
that's where it was built, brother
wasn't there a closer one?
no
there's Johnson and Wales which is on Miami Beach, but
of course, it's because I rushed into it, man
I rushed into it and I should have waited more, a little longer to see other things and other universities but, well

I only have three weeks left and I'm done, man
yeah, three more weeks and that's it, I'm finished, you
well, yeah, my graduation is like in October
well, the ceremony, you
you're going to invite me?
but of course not
only decent people are going
you're stupid!
when I wear a jacket I look really elegant
of course, you look like a classy whore
I wear my long tail jacket
you classy whore, no you always have a long tail, stupid
I went to the disco on Saturday
so here
huh?
with whom?
with that guy Ernesto, I don't think you know him, the guy who was dating Pedro
so
I don't know him
no, you've never met him
so the guy called me, like, he was going with Manolo
but suddenly then the guy couldn't
so I stayed with
because I was all excited already, bullshit, I said
I want to go but, like, I don't want to go by myself

so the guy, out of nowhere, like, he never calls me; the guy hardly ever calls me and all of a sudden we chat once in a while
but, like, out of nowhere the guy, we've been talking lately
and like, he calls me on Saturday
and the guy what are you doing today, and so on
and then me, nothing, man
you want to go to the disco, he tells me, and I say, let's give it a go, then
and we went to the disco
it was kind of boring, man
and, on top of that, it was chucking it down, it kept raining all day and night
so I got there and it was windy, right?
so I had arrived all elegant, man, hair to die for, like, and raining, man, my hair got all messed up and I got soaked, damn it
so I went in
it was great, you've never been to the disco, right?
never
you, we should go
like, it's nice, man, some nice ass there, brother
and the best thing is that, like, we liked to go there to look at ass, and that
but, like, on Saturdays, for example, so, but
I think the first time I went, I think it was a Friday, because I think Friday night is Latin night so that night they were playing reggaeton
but on Saturdays they only play electronic music, dance music, I don't know, some weird music, man, that's OK to dance to for a while, you know, it's not bad, but they play it all night, so we got bored
so they opened something like, I don't know, a lounge on the side, right inside there
and now they play more, more diverse music, so all of a sudden hip-hop and reggaeton, so they keep changing it, so it's better
yeah
see, so then you're not, like, with the same music all night
did you find out when it opens?
yeah, they're always open on Fridays, man
but I don't know what happened that day because I saw movement there that night, man
the last two Fridays that I've gone, I went because of my birthday, remember, I went by and asked, hey is it open here, and the guys said no, it's closed
imagine
I always forget to get the number
I should get the number to

I think they have a webpage, don't they, to ask, to find out, you know

because that shit, man, I don't think it only opens on Sunday, man
because, I mean, man
do you realize the amount of money they'd lose on a Friday if they didn't open, man
I would think they're always building
but what are they going to build if it's always the same shit
if they were building they would also close on Saturday, or they would close temporarily
strange, and how much do they charge to go in?
huh?
they always charged me ten, but on the Saturday I went it was fifteen
oh
I'm glad I had, like, twenty dollars cash, and I thought, six dollars for parking, I thought, ten to go in, and then the rest, I don't know, maybe I'd buy something to drink
the whole thing, man
I would really have been up shit creek if I hadn't had anything
what pisses me off is that they don't take credit cards, man
like, I mean, we're in Florida, man
we're in Miami, man
and they don't take cards, brother
and there in Nicaragua, everywhere in Hipa, brother, they take cards, man
I pay, I always pay by credit card to get in
but here no bar or disco takes them
what?
here no disco takes them, so they can make a profit with the fucking ATM
ah, that's exactly right, but still at the disco the ATM is by the toilets, man, it's inside
but it costs you an arm and a leg
man, the other day, maybe one of the first times I was there
OK, the second time I was there, I was sure the first time I had paid with a card
so I was all sure of it, man, and I'm going to pay with my card
and the guy, no, we don't take cards
and I told him, shit, what do I do now
so the guy tells me, we have an ATM in there
and I, OK, so I'll go, man, I'll go to the ATM
then the guy kept my ID, so that

so I come back, I go and take money from the ATM
I was cool, because I already knew they charged
but I thought, well, what the heck, I'm already here, what am I going to do
so I went and took out the money and paid and damn well went in
and when I get my bank statement, man, I mean
I think I took twenty out, man
and they charged me, like, ten dollars for taking it out, man
I mean, it's a scam, man
but it says there at the ATM, it tells you how much it charges
sure, I know, but the fact is I never pay attention to those things, man
I'm so
it says there this shit charges a fee
remember us blondes are thick, wise guy
blondes are thick
yeah, huh
plus I don't read, I get read to
I get read to
you're an idiot
see?
no, but it's true
I mean, a person like me, man
I didn't learn to read
read things to me
hey, look, let's go
we're going to the fair one of these days
do you want to go?
to the what?
to the fair
what fair?
the fair, stupid
the one at FIU

what, I've never been to that shit, you know that
you're so stupid
but this is the Nicaraguan fair, or the fair
you're stupid, that's Exponica, stupid

and that's, like, around September or November
the fair with the rides
yeah, the fair is the funfair, man, like we Nicaraguans say, funfair
the funfair
yeah, the funfair
you know I've never been there whenever that shit's here you dick
I always go
whenever I'm here, I go
so the year, so, like
right
whenever I was here on vacations, I went
but now that I live here
I just crushed my own ovary
what?
you're a moron
ouch, I crushed an ovary
so then, I was saying
I don't always go
and last year I went
you know it pisses me off that I paid for the bracelet
I don't think I remember how much it was
the bracelet is so that you can go around and ride on, I mean, ride on anything you want, so
instead of going around buying, like, tickets and that, because there are people, well, queueing to buy ticket after ticket
so I said, hell, let's buy the bracelet, and it'll be worth it
and for nothing, I bought, I only rode on one or two things
because I, like, I don't ride those things, you know?
and I never ride that shit
and I don't even know why I bought it
but I only ride, like, one or two, man, I always get dizzy
I always get dizzy every time and I end up throwing up
I rode, like, two and I was going about with a terrible headache
you're daft
but you already know that, surely
it's because my brain is full of air
huh?
like my brain is full of air
your brain is full of air?
yeah, man, I mean my head, sorry, because I have no brain, I have air
the peanut is rattling around in your head
it's rattling around in there
the nice little one I have pedalling in there is rattling around
yeah, poor thing
yeah, hey, and did you notice?
what?
a man has got pregnant for the first time
what do you mean?
huh?
what do you mean?
a man has got pregnant for the first time
I don't get it
a pregnant man

I don't know what you mean
I mean, look, a pregnancy is when someone has a baby inside
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, but a man, how?
well, a man has got pregnant
I mean, technology and science are so advanced, so they've got a man pregnant, man
I saw it on Despierta América yesterday and then it went out on Primer Impacto
and what did they do, man?
did they put a uterus in him and all that crap?
no, so look, it's like, he was a woman and had surgery
oh, I get it
then, but, so, he got the vagina removed and got a penis put on

how do they remove the vagina, man, do they remove the hole?
they shut the hole
the clitoris is the head and
gross
I don't know
but I saw how they do it
you saw how, no way, where did you see it?
well, there in a book of my sister's
I wanna see it
medicine
what I saw was the development, man, when the fetus is developing and so on
at the beginning we're all girls
what?
at the beginning everyone is a girl
wait, wait, wait, a plane is passing by and I can't hear you
shit, man, that plane, I swear it brushed past my head
son of a bitch

it's going to take your little apartment with it, man
I swear it's going to take my hovel with it, man
listen, the thing is that at the beginning everyone is, like, girls

the thing we have there is identical for boys and girls

but the man's head is the woman's clitoris, you understand?
yeah
the woman's labia are the man's balls
balls?
yeah, balls
you mean the testicles?


they more or less look alike when they're developing

and
I mean, at the beginning we all have a vagina
yeah, so the other day I saw in a movie there how they do it, there in Nip Tuck some guys were explaining it

that's a, that Nip Tuck is not a movie, stupid, it's a series
a series, then
so then yeah, that's what I saw
but that's cool, man, I'd like to get pregnant
what?
I'd like to get pregnant
hello
how are you?
wait
hm, yeah
can I come in?
thanks
yeah, that's what I saw
oh, OK, thanks
bye
hello?
my stupid neighbor
wait, wait
no, don't hang up, give me a second
wait, don't go, stupid
talk
yeah, so
so yes, well, I was watching the news on Primer Impacto
and so he's, I mean, he was a woman before
and he had an operation then and became a man
so he got a penis and everything
and then he, so the guy got married to a woman
yeah, what an idiot, he became a man
yeah, and got married then to another chick and then it seems that the woman he married, well, she couldn't get pregnant
so he loved her so much he said, I'll get pregnant for you
and they got him pregnant, you know, he got pregnant

so it seems obviously it was artificial insemination, and so on
see, because they weren't going to insert a penis through the hole in his penis
and then, to get the child out?
c-section, idiot
c-section
c-section
they weren't going to get it out through his ass
hey
imagine the pain, brother
no, no, no, and then when it's born they say it looks the spitting image of you
yeah, yeah
that
exactly
I'd like, someday I'll be a father, you'll see
what?
someday I'll be a father
hopefully, man, because

that's my goal, like, that's my greatest dream
because one of my dreams I already achieved, namely, going to the concert, brother
that was the ultimate
that was like a dream, you know, one of those material dreams

but my dream, I don't know, my dream as a person, as a fulfilled human being, I mean, is to be that, to be a father, man
I wanna have a child
and name him Yurandier Eliécer
huh?
I'm going to name him Yurandier Eliécer
Yurandier
yes, it's an, I mean, it's an elegant name, what's wrong with you?
it's elegant for the neighborhood
what a stupid name, you're joking
hmm, it's a royal name
Yurandier Eliécer
of course
really Schick Quarter, Yurandier Eliécer
geez, what a name
yeah, man
or I could name him Kelvin Josué
Kelvin Josué
pfff
yes
Kevin Brian too
Kevin Brian
yeah
you know, the other day I was watching a show in Nicaragua there, I think
I can't remember if it was Margarita or something like that, one of those shows
so, the thing is they went to Costa, or something like that

and so you know they speak English there, and so on
and so, man, people give their children placenames
man, there was a guy there called Washington D.C.

man, I was laughing my ass off, some of the names they have, brother
yeah, yeah, they pick names and the guys can pick last names too
of course, man
so they give them all some surnames
oh, they can pick last hames?
yes
how so?
yeah, the guys, I don't know, they can pick their last names, I don't know how, man
that's weird, so nobody's family there, then
they can choose their last names, or I don't know, so they have last names like O'Brian, like
really
imagine that
they have some weird last names, no kidding
imagine, there must be an Oprah Winfrey there, man
a Victoria Beckham
no, really, not that, because I don't think she seems black
of course, man, if they choose celebrities' names and stuff
there was a dude called I don't know what, man, I can't remember
I remember years ago we had a driver who, the guy had a daughter was pregnant
so the kid is born and I ask him, what's his name
so he tells me, no, my daughter
it was around the time of the Backstreet Boys
and he tells me, my daughter really likes the Backstreet Boys and named her Kevin Brian
and I was shocked, man
Kevin Brian, and it's not a boy
imagine, she likes the Backstreet Boys and NSync and names her Nick Justin
Nick Justin, imagine
imagine that
really cool
shit
and then they had a
and when they had a pinata for her, man, they used the name, thank you
they named her
someone's yelling for me
what?
my mom is yelling, I said
no, stupid, don't hang up on me
I really have to get up, man, I'm
so, get up
get up, but don't hang up on me, stupid
I'll call you
no, stupid, no
oh, dude, dude, my mom's coming up the stairs to give me crap
OK, but don't hang up on me, I'll wait but don't hang up on me
huh, no, c'mon, I have to go and shower
no, stupid, give me five more minutes, let's talk
what was I going to tell you?

let's go out this weekend, stupid
OK, then
let's go to discos
no way, I have to tell my boss I'm in town
oh, so you told him, I'm leaving indefinitely and I'll let you know when I get back
what do you mean?
what did you say to him?
what?
what did you say to him?
nothing except that I was going to New Orleans and I don't know what
and that he'll give me, that it was going to take a weekend
so he told me OK
the following weekend he tells me no, better not, look, we're going to stay here
so I told him no, that my parents say a weekend is not enough to see New Orleans, yeah, you're right, let me know when you get back, man, this guy says
jerk, bet you'll call him and he'll tell you, yeah, son of a bitch, just go fuck yourself, he's going to tell you
what?
I want to go to the electronic music concert
yeah, Olga told me that
do you want to go and see it?
are you crazy, brother?
to get a whiff of fresh air, brother
plus I don't like electronic music
there's a shitload of girls
huh?
almost all the girls from Miami are coming
so no wonder you're going
no, man
you're going to get laid, you're not going to listen to electronic music or to dance
I can't
you're going to see penises that look like vaginas
hopefully
no way no
you know, man
well, on Saturday I went to the disco
there was, there's a guy at university, man, who I've seen, and I, like, this guy is, I thought already
it was a bit noticeable, so I thought this guy's, this guy's weird
but I never thought about it again
well, I ran into him at the disco on Saturday, man
shit, brother, so he is!

almost as girly as Carlos, brother
really?
maybe a little less
no, the thing is that Carlos is naturally that way
this guy, I mean, he walked
what is he like?
Carlos is naturally like that, I think
Carlos

Carlos is naturally girly
I mean, this guy was, like, going around all dressed up, I mean, listen, with a t-shirt
I mean, a white t-shirt with a blue tie

shit
I mean, man, but it was a Fruit of the Loom t-shirt, man, those Haines t-shirts, man

and then jeans, the blue hat, I mean the blue tie and a blue beret, really, I mean, a blue military beret

man
eyebrows almost as gay as yours
stupid
and nails longer than Ivy Queen, man
son of a bitch
mmhm, I mean
I mean, man, I just noticed the nails today because just now I was with, I mean, I wasn't with him, but there was an event at the university
and so the guy was chatting to a friend of mine and I was there
and the guy had some crazy nails, I think this guy's going to turn into a girl, man
and now that I was really watching him, you can really tell, man
you can really tell
but he doesn't anything
no, we've never ever talked to each other
I mean, I'm like
I think this guy is gay; I'm going to start talking to him
but I don't know, the guy, I try, like, sometimes to start a conversation
but, for example, today he was talking to my friend and I also started talking to her and he was still there
and so I looked at the guy as if to include him in the conversation, as if to tell him, OK, I'm talking to you, you know, I mean, so we're talking to both of them
but the guy, it's like he didn't take any notice of me
so, goddammit, I mean, I didn't want him to like me
mmhm, yes
yes, but I'm trying to make him my friend
and you're being nice
yeah
they take advantage of my kind nature, really
you're becoming a beautiful human being
yeah, brother, they take advantage of my kind nature
that's crazy
what
so harmful
what was I going to tell you?
and you haven't spoken to Alberto?
no, I haven't spoken to him lately
well, since I returned it was, like, I think it was three or four days after I returned and he never came online again, man, so I haven't spoken to him because
since you came back from where, from New Orleans?

the guy shaved his head
yeah, man
he looks good
yes
and he has a neat beard and it all looks good
yes
and me, stupid
he looks good
I'm sad, man
why?
did I tell you I broke up with my ex, no, so, the one I was dating

you know what he told me today, brother?
what did he tell you?
that he never loved me, man
you're kidding
yes
geez, and why?
I don't know
look, he told you that because he's resentful
but he's not resentful, brother
I mean, he told me, like, I did love you a lot, and so I was with you because, so, I mean, I was happy with you, he tells me, I wanted to be with you.
but I never really loved you, he told me
never what?
never really loved you
what a jerk!
and I told him, shit, brother
I mean, do you realize what you're telling me?
I told him
yes
he tells me
I know I'm hurting you
he says
but I prefer that, at least I'm being honest with you
he tells me
I tell him, shit, but that's horrible, I tell him
because the guy always told me, see, that he loved me and stuff like that
and then we broke up in November
and then in December when I returned he asked me if we could get back together, man
and he told me something like
now I love you more than ever
he tells me
now I'm more certain than ever about my feelings for you, and stuff like that
all that stuff, you know?
so I told him, I told him today when we where chatting, I told him, so why did you tell me all that, I told him
I don't know, he told me, I was confused, he told me
but I don't know, I never really loved you, he tells me
man, you know, it's the same thing, man, happening to me again
no, I can imagine it must be horrible to hear that
no, horrible, man
at least, at least this guy, I was only, he was only with me, you know, this guy Alberto
he was with you while he was with me
and he supposedly told me he loved me when he really loved you
disappointment
but
shit, man, so then it's even more disappointing
but really, man, I was madly in love with this guy, man
and I still am, man, I'm still in love because one doesn't fall out of love overnight
but, but for him to say that, brother, damn, it hurts a lot, a whole lot, man
I mean, it hurts as a person, you know?
you poor thing
I feel so sad, I mean, I feel really sad, man, because
I don't know, you know, I mean, at the beginning when we broke up, when we'd just broken up I asked the guy, like
do you still love me?
I said to him
he says to me
no, I don't love you anymore
he tells me
but, but yes, I do care about you
and so I was still
huh?
so I was stilll thinking, like
shit
I said
he stopped loving me so quickly
I said
and, and, I mean, I started feeling really bad because, because I said
damn, it's so easy to forget me
it's easy to get over me
and stop loving me
I thought
and so I told the guy today or yesterday, I can't remember
and I told him, like
you know what?
I said to him
I'm going to be honest with you
and I feel sad
I tell him
I mean, it makes me feel bad the fact that you stopped loving me so quickly and so on and stuff like that
I say to him
and, and, and, and damn, I say to him
you make me feel like I'm an easy person to forget
I tell him
a person so, so, like, that's so easy to get over
I tell him
so he says to me
no
he says to me
it's not that, it's just that I never really loved you
he tells me
what a downer, man
and to say it to me so coldly, man, you know?
I mean
so cold
yeah, and you know, the guy's now living with Pedro
what?
he's living with Pedro
are they dating?
no, no, shut up
I mean, at first the plan was that we were going to, because I was going back to Nicaragua, move in together
so the three of us were going to move in together
like roommates, you know, so, like, it would be cheaper, you know
it would be cheaper to rent a place

and so, like, I told them
you two go ahead, start moving, and that
and, like, the guys liked the idea, so
and so, like, now the guys are living together now
and they're roommates and that
and, and I don't know, man
yesterday I argued with Pedro because of Victor and
why did you argue?
because, yes, because that guy Pedro started to tell me, like, that Victor started to tell him he likes a guy from there and so on
and so I was like
tell me, tell me
and the guy told me something like, I can't tell you, and whatever
and I:
come on, Pedro, you've never told me before, I can't tell you something
I mean, because Pedro and I tell each other absolutely everything, like absolutely everything, you know?
like every detail about our sex lives, you know, our sex lives
we talked, like, we told each other details, you know
and I used to ask him, like
and did he put it in you?
and did you put it in him?
stuff like that, you know
yeah
and so we told each other things like that, never gave a shit about it, you know
and so the guy
I don't know
so I feel like the guy's now becoming, going to become intimate with my ex, man
and I'm going to be left looking stupid, man
and so I said to him, like
OK, then
I tell him
don't tell me anything
that's that
OK, then
don't tell me
I tell him
so he tells me
no, I
he says
don't give me that shit, and stuff
so I tell him
what shit?
I tell him
don't you talk to me that way
I tell him
don't be shitty
I tell him
you know what?
see you around
I tell him
and I blocked him, brother
he made me feel bad, man
because the guy started to tell me things like, forget Victor, he says to me, forget him now
and so
he's not
I don't
frankly
he tells me
I don't see any kind of future for the two of you
he tells me
forget him, and stuff
so I told him
but why?
I say to him
like, if you're telling me this, it's for a reason
I tell him
if you're telling me to forget about him
I tell him
there's a reason
so he
until, I mean, I had to tell him over and over and, and, until I convinced him to tell me
and I never tried, I never had to convince Julio to tell me anything
like, he told me things right away, you know
so
but it's, look, dude, it's his roommate, maybe he feels bad
no, no, no, no, no, I understand, you know, because he told me so
I mean, the guy tells me
don't tell him anything
don't tell him anything
he says to me
because, because if you tell him
he says to me
and you know I'm living with him now
he says to me
and I don't want to create conflict between us
and I understand that, you know?
but, but, whatever, I told him, like
don't worry about it
I won't tell him
like, Pedro knows when we tell each other something you don't say anything, we don't say anything, you know
I mean, and for him to tell me like that so many times
but don't say anything, be really careful if you do tell him, and stuff
I mean, he made me feel so awful, like he didn't trust me any more, you know
he made me feel like shit, man
so I blocked him
I don't know, I feel, like, resentment towards him, man
no, man
I don't know, brother
I feel all sad, like, this whole situation is
like, for example, this guy Manolo, brother, yesterday we went out for dinner

and so we went out for dinner and everything was great, you know
but, like, plan brothers, you know
and I really like him, you know
I like the guy
and everything, I mean, I like the guy physically
and as a person, because the guy's a really nice person, man
but the guy's still thinking about his ex, man








how are you?
good, good.


eh Sean wants to have a meeting at A One with, they still have problems with the television tower.


because one says one thing, the other says another and apparently it has been

next tuesday at, com, at nine or ten.
what time do you prefer?


speaking about next friday.


the eighteenth of January is teacher planning day.









because there's no kids, there's nobody.



fuck
but you are white.
what are you doing giving that day?
oh, that's true, that's true, that's true.

right, yes.
A is a matter of check it through that everything is ok.












because A has been occupied for.

B the same.


if two guys want to do an offering one day, fine






and why are you going to go if later they are going to say.
man, you didn't do this this and this and this.




























because there's nothing.












call him.


and if he haven't.























































what did he say to you?






but did you tell him that Craig said that they are already been altered right?



eh Friday of next week.



because the teacher should be there.

there's no kids so we can enter and go out of all the rooms we want.



at A, I think we should do A first so we can end with A.










don't ask.









































































































oh, stop.

then I'll be ten thousand@hotfemale.com insead of at.



















































































one gone.
















































































































stop.
cut it out.

















































































cut it out.

yes.










I'm getting a headache.



I'm not listening to you.















no, the one from








































































look.





















































































yeah.








she got the hosepipe.






he, my mom got the hosepipe.
started hitting him with the hosepipe.





















































































































































oh, Jesus Christ.

































































loose-fitting shirt?

I want Taco Bell.











































no, but doing it in Spanish.





I mean it's not like, you know, one, two, three, four.







love.
in numerals.













you like to say "I love you".



and I mean it as passionately as you mean "I love you".

I love you.
I love you.



in, in, like, it's pretty poor and in








watch it








this in the, this is the layout of the gazebo.

and this will be, like, the path.






but the Camino, I mean, that's like, wow, out there.















































































































because your mom's an old lady.




















watch it.
you're asking for trouble.











































my sister-in-law wants me to do, you know.



to see how the changing is between one language and the other.

yeah it records it and all, like the chips in the little camera.





and then I guess they figure out, you know, whatever she does something to do with transcribing and Spanglish and you know, what do you say and everything.

but no.
I'll turn it off.
and if, if I know that we're, you know, we're not talking in English, or as my brother says if you don't want anyone to hear it, personal or something.

and your friend?
hasn't she even called yet?
and can't you come out in that thing?
hello! if it's four wheel drive?
snow!
my sister lives in Georgia.
and there was no snow at all.
well, I don't know where her house is.
well, maybe in the mountains there's snow.
yeah, more dead than alive.
but what time did she call you, eight in the morning?
last night?
oh, last night.
that's in the middle of the state, more or less.
no, no, no!
that's in the middle of the state.
it is either to the North or the South of Gainesville.
it's horse country.
it's horse country.






I mean you can see the big, the big pieces of property with, that it seems that you're at, you know at Virginia where they have the horses.


because that part of the state has a few hills, not like a lot of hills.

no, no, no.
so it's, like, horse country.



both, she says that they had it yesterday too.
and the two of them went out.
they are perfect.

so cute.
and that and no, the size, you couldn't have chosen it better because it's impossible.


what?
but also, to me he looks like his mother.
if you see the.
if you see the picture of the mother, of the.
oh, you are so mean!

he's very cute the little kid.
fuck, I'm even cold.
but I don't feel the heat, you know.
I mean, I feel it.
you know that when you turn the heating on.
it has one, the first time you turn it on, it has a colour.
the other side it's sixty-one.
one?
it's the north side.

good.
who, the one who lives near here?
charge him.
what a cheek!

oh, he sends them alone and he doesn't come?
listen, what cheek!
what cheek!
well, too bad.
no.


and they did it so that nobody could understand what they say.
because if they had written it for you in everyday language, maybe, but.
well yes the
what's his name, Helen?
I'm stopping.
and saying.
it's fucking cold.
I go.
and I see in the.
and it's sixty one.
that, no, I'm very sorry.
it's too cold.
I know that for quarter past in the evening it's not cold.
I go.
and we are going to turn on the heating.
and Jennifer tells me.
do you believe that it has?
and me heat.
that there is no heating?
most probably there's not.
so he went in where Helen was.
and he went there.
and Esmeralda looks at me because I told her that I turned it on.
and we acted, and I acted like I had nothing to say.
it was a comment.
I'm going to say.
yes, me, it was very cold.
she says, Lilian gets up five minutes later.
and says.
now it says sixty-three.
and I told her.
well, at least it's risen two degrees, because it used to be sixty-one.
yes, here it said seventy-four.
and I told her.
oh, he must have touched that, because Jennifer and I set it on seventy.
Jennifer and I set it on seventy.
yes, but she didn't take her jacket off.
so she's cold too.
and at least there at the far side they get the sun.
but here on the north side we don't ever get direct sun.

sometimes sixty-one, sixty-one.
when is he coming back?
he's crazy.
yes, he has warmed up the the blood became a.


about five years ago.

and this morning I left the house.
I had to go to the supermarket cause I had no milk.
my car has a thermostat, so it tells you, you know.

yeah, it tells you what it is.

I don't even give a fuck.
it was, when I got back from the grocery-store.
the grocery-storem, it was saying said forty-one.
but when I dropped the groceries and left, it was saying thirty-nine.
and I said fuck





but not like the normal cars where if you want heat you move it to red.







but the first time I went to use this heat a few years ago I'm like.







but the air conditioning, yes, it gives you the chance.












I put it on red.
let me tell you.
my car has heated seats.
I've never used them.
yesterday I got into the car with Irene, we went for lunch.
she turned it on.
and I said.
fuck Irene, I've got a hot!
she told me.
no, it's that they had the heating thing.





so good.




for your back, right, right.







you, eh, Víctor is living with you again?
oh, the fact is that Jorge is a good husband.
I remember that you told me.

he's a nurse, isn't he?





and why don't you say to.




so fuck, that's not fair!



a little bit of everything.





then they have it in for you.

I don't know how people can live on unemployment.
because that's a pain.
I don't know how people can live on the unemployment because is a pain.
I remember the only time that.


no, and if, and if your husband gets along with him, that's great.


and for Elba it's good because they have both.
and she has two fathers which can be a little, can be a little challenging.




























I don't want to explain it to him.



he'll be late.


he means well, but when family gets put last.






















exaggerated.














































there's no doubt about that.

























margins to, I don't know what, on the appendix.









what?

the guys were playing football.
and Maruja, the girl from across the street










I was thinking that, I don't know, Mary always gets annoyed getting all the drinks





that these kids need to drink.




















then do it, because nothing is going to grow there.










and Rosa said today that she was going to give her a bath

she's squeaky clean?




It's amazing that Marga hasn't come out.
how come?










but I didn't hit any traffic, so I was able to go straight











it's because she gave everybody the day off except for herself.
and.


and how was your day?




but she.















that's it.


















no, but Rosa, the sandals.


Rosa said sandals?


they call me Hialeah when I wear sandals.



get yourself ready.























you're not going to die.


here comes Marga.





she's gone.




























I'd say like Mum's.
do your toes look like your mum's or your dad's?
Mummy.

and Daddy.
no.
Mummy's.
Mummy.





















never satisfied.






















thanks.














forget about it Marga.


























































Margarita, call Rosa.


yes, go get Rosa.
call your sister.


yes, call your sister.

























Rosa, take Marga to the bathroom.
hurry up.











I haven't taken her.

good, isn't it?




and Susie made a mess of the first lesson
she deserved a bit of hassle.
really?


I mean I'm thinking, fuck, if I'm not here what the hell would happen to me?
yes, but
I mean, they're paying you to do quality work.
and if you're not doing quality work, why should they pay you?
no, but it wasn't misquality either.




but today I had done all my little integrals.



the little bit of work that they set for me, it was quite late.














no.




I don't know.
there are enough of them there.
I completely ignored him today.

I ignored him completely.
do you know what I like?
that he is going to be with all those girls next year.

and he's not going to go in.
oh, please.





























































































































































what?






















like Ulrika.
how pretty!
how pretty!

I told her:






she put it in the mouth

no, no, not the mouth!

, no!




































wait.
I have something small to do.
and I have something I have to do on the computer.

what else?

I think that's all.
ah, good, but it's the weekend, so you can take your time.
I have three days.
tidy my room this weekend.
I'm going to tidy it really well sort out eveything, organise everything.


yes, because you're very organised




how's the going for you?
or not?
ah, I don't know what they're waiting for to hire more people at To Go.
and this is how many





so far they haven't hired anyone.
but when they hire them, it's down to me to train them.


and then I imagine it will be a month or something.
I can move the server from now on.
but for now I'm in To Go.







































and on Thursday I have a trainer meeting.






because, don't you remember?













or it's that there's, like, there's, like, about four or five cooks that are trainers.





















but







and how are you getting on at university?
fine.





































































so how are you for girlfriends?

what?





you just have to tell me how you're getting on.
fine.
so, you're getting on fine?














































what you're telling me?
nothing else.
























and what happened with Adrian?

are they still speaking to you or not?




























so your school, it's just a middle school, or is it middle school and high school, like, in the same building?










so your school goes up to which grade?

no, but the building, like, to what grade does it go to?

eighth grade, and then you get to transfer over there to Sheridan.




















































































what time is it?





















































































































































































and you're not going to get involved in anything?
I don't know.
I want to do some sport.
but I don't know which one.
you want to do sport?
























































































so said in the evening.




what was I going to ask you?
well, a friend invited me to his house.
but I'm grounded.
so I can't go.
who, who invited you?

he invited you?


he asked me.
I said I couldn't because I was grounded.




on the bus?
no, it's that he and Marco are in Alberto's football team.
he was the brother?
his brother is in Alberto's football team.

yes.

football.





football, football.
football.
football.

and it's more.
the other is American football.
football is American football in Spanish.

in the school team, from his school or from Penbrook Pines?
no, from Penbrook Pines.

have you seen him in the games?
yes, sometimes.
there?











people are smoking.


how was


I know, but Laura
you were in another
watch out, you've hit the top.


when Laura walks by, her stomach seems to be falling out.
why?












is she leaving?



oh, let's go there.





so is working now.


she told me that if a table became available we could go there.


the problem is not sitting at the same table.











no, she doesn't at all.












look at this.
the mosquitoes are following us.






























and she tells me:
tell Selena to go for lunch.
to go for lunch?

but Selena was eating, or wasn't she eating?



and now Selena should eat.
tell her to come and eat.
as if she was a mother.
why?









so then I stopped working there, yes.






so then Iria told me that she had to collect Selena's files and deliver them to her case manager, so that she can file them.









and I told her:
Selena, these patients have already been.
but Iria has told me that you should file them in her.
honestly.
there were two with problems.
really?

so I told her:
Selena, there are problems with these two.







that can be done in five minutes.



so whatever Selena there were about ten patients.

and I told her:
Selena, those two patients have problems.
the poster is right there to explain the problem to you so you can deal with it.
then she looked at me.

er, and why?
I don't understand why the person who checked this didn't do it straight away.
she didn't call the one who resolved the problem.
while it's not her who resolved the problem.

I can't understand why the person who checked this hasn't done it.
she didn't solve the problem.
and then it's funny because I should have just been like, okay, she did this and doesn't intend to check it because she is already paying you a salary and wants you, you are the case manager and she wants the case manager to check it.

I mean I checked it.


check this.
not solve it, but check it.
exactly because there's a reason that they are case managers so they could solve the problems.





so I looked at her.
and I told her:
I don't know, Selena.
because the thing is with Selena, I've already learned to just have patience with her.







I told her:
I don't know, Selena gave me that.


this is what Iria gave me.
and she passed it to me for you.
then she picked it up




well, I'm not gonna stop.
well I'm not gonna stop what I'm doing right now to solve this.

and I told her:
no, no, there's no hurry, Selena.
you do this tomorrow morning, when you're calmer, whenever you want.






poor work.
no, no, but I don't understand.



Selena, if you want to, give it to Pedro.


it can be given to Pedro.
and that he files it for you.


here, Pedro, look at this for me.
oh.
and he says.
then Selena told him:
I'll do it for you now.









Clara, are these your patients?
and this one at the front has some problem

did she already read it?

ah, ok, that's easy-peasy.
















there's only one.
how wonderful.


how wonderful.


yeah, fine.

and then these others don't have any problems.
but Iria wants you to file them in the.

ok, mummy.



because I had finished checking like two more patients,







don't tell her you're with me so that she wants to come here.







then she handled it completely fine.



yes, mummy, give me everything that needs looking at with my patients that I prefer to have the.
so I can have everything here.


the same thing happens to me all the time.



well,.



ah, ok, I'm already writing it here.

oh, I'm snowed under.
problems.
to talk.
and worry about his problems.
and I am snowed under.
I have to do this.
but if he is the case
he doesn't work.
but she is the case manager for those patients.




just because she gets just a little bit too busy.




and she drowns herself in a glass of water if it's not her way.







I have to see.
can I come in?




well, she went in.









the cat and Maria have been at it.



oh yeah, Maria and I had never been at it because from the beginning I knew that with that lady you have to have a little bit more patience than everybody else.





yeah, because when somebody, when


and you have some sort of manners.

you have manners like you office.


exactly, you have to live with the same people, so why would you get in a fight with them or whatever?


remember when Annie was her assistant?

















do you remember when Annie was Maria's case manager assistant?



yeah, but now she doesn't scream as much because she's talking to Jose.
she knows that she has to restrain her language because Jose's a grown man.

















regardless it's like if I was Annie I would look at her and be like:
do you think you could talk to me as if I were a person, please?
















no, that when Annie was her assistant her assistant case manager that Maria went every five minutes:
oh, Marie.








Maria, do you think you can talk to me like a person please?
she doesn't have to shout at me.
because they are a person.




and the one time that Maria screamed at me was because she was trying to print a order.
and I was faxing.


so she was like "hey".

hey, i need to print.

yes, yes, wait a moment.
let me send this fax.
finish sending this fax, exactly.










this is a moment.
it is two minutes more.


Maria, you know I understand you better when you talk to me.
when you shout at me I don't know what's happening in my mind and I block you out totally.




well, that when it finishes
look, you brought a mosquito with you.


I'm gonna have grey marks all over myself right now.



she's gotten better because Maria, it used to be with everyone.

this mosquito
it's behind you.
it wants to be my brother.









I'm allergic.



lumps all over my legs.
but in Cuba and those countries ther's a lot more mosquitoes because places are not air-conditioned.



did you have a mosquito net in your bedroom?
yeah, I had a mosquito net in my bedroom.


I wanted to walk around the mosquito net twenty-four seven.






but with the mosquito net, do you?




does it get any hotter with the mosquito net or it doesn't get hotter with the mosquito net?













the food.
you have the food here too.
yes, but nobody cooks like my grandmothers.
nobody on this earth has been able to compare to my grandma.


my mom's mom used to cook the best corn-flour.
I don't like corn-flour.

I don't like corn-flour.

my mom makes really, really good corn-flour.
but my mom's corn-flour is sweet.
it's not the corn-flour like for food.
my mom's corn-flour is awesome.



maybe it's not corn-flour because it's called cream of wheat.
it's like oats.
no, it's flour.
it's not avena.
it's corn-flour.
it's corn-flour but







oh my god, a mosquito bit me on my scar.



where does this go?





I've killed it.




milk, sugar, and ready.

sugar and mmhm.

you can put milk, sugar.



it's kind of like corn-starch.

well, you tried corn-starch, right?








the corn-starch thing is really good too.
I remember I introduced Emilio to the corn-starch.

and there was corn-starch at his house.
there was corn-starch at his house.

there was corn-starch at his house.



honestly, it was dinner.













it's corn-starch.










did you ever try corn-starch?


doesn't like my corn-flour.
is you corn-flour anything like your mom's corn-flour?











and in fact my mom hasn't made it in three months.









well, either both of them, corn-starch and corn-flour.



























































what?








then you will say:
no.
I have heard this, this and this.















nothing of lalala.









what did he want to know?









but I didn't see it.



































































so it may be Patty's TV.


I, it, Patty was sleeping.
yes, Patty was asleep.
Patty had fallen asleep.
he woke up.
I think when you had been sleeping he woke up and called Patty.
now he's doing it the other way round.





























































I want to dance.
so


that was in Miami-Dade as well.




















times about a hundred that's about a thousand two hundred more or less.





























Miami-Dade is seventy dollars per credit, right?






why weren't you at Miami-Dade two years before coming here?













the school semms to be a little bit more confusing than Miami-Dade.
























okay.

so the reason I like Miami-Dade is because



ah, to me that's not important.




but what I like is on the side of the building has a really big four or three or two.










so, for me who is a little bit slow
quicker.

because if it's building four, then parking here.





















no, no, for me is leaving in like I would have to wait for five minutes.
